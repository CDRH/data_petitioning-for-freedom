</p>
<p>NETERER, District Judge:</p> 
<p>The petitioner, aged thirty years, whose father declared
his intention to become a citizen of the United States in 1900,
came to the United States In 1897, and has since been a resident
therein. On the 12th of January, 1912, he was arrested under
a warrant issued by the Acting Secretary of Labor, charging "that
the said alien is unlawfully within the United States, in that
he has been found receiving, sharing in or deriving benefits from
the earnings of a prostitute or prostitutes", and thereafter
ordered deported. An appeal taken to the Secretary of Commerce
and Labor confirmed this order, and warrant of deportation was
thereupon issued, execution of which was suspended pending dis-
charge of the prisoner from the federal prison where he had been
committed on conviction on an indictment under the Mann Act.
Petitioner files this petition for writ of habeas corpus, alleg-
ing that he is in custody and about to be deported, and that he
did not have a fair trial, in that he was not permitted to in-
spect the warrant of arrest or any of the evidence upon which it
was issued, and that there is no evidence upon which to base a
warrant of deportation.</p> 
<p>The function of the court in a proceeding of this kind is
to ascertain whether petitioner has been accorded a fair hearing,
and, also, whether there is any evidence upon which to predicate</p>
<pb></pb>
<p>the dharge made. Under the rule of the Department of Commerce
and Labor, and the law, the accused must be notified of the
charge against him, and have opportunity to inspect the warrant
of arrest and the evidence upon which it is issued, and be ad-
vised of his right to have counsel, to the end that his interests
may be properly safeguarded in the hearing by one specially con-
cerned therewith, and in accordance with established, recognized
rules of procedure. The order of deportation must be supported by
the evidence at the hearing, and the charge must be established
by legal testimony.</p> 
<p>Upon this hearing, the petitioner testified that he was not
advised of the charge against him; that he requested permission to
consult counsel; that at the time he had been convicted of a felony
and had counsel engaged, and that his counsel was in the City
within a day or so. His testimony is supported by the brother
of the accused, who stated that counsel had been employed, and
also stated that he did not decline to employ counsel for the
accused, and that he was abundantly able to do so. Much appears
in this testimony which has no place there. The petitioner may
be a moral degenerate, and from this record as it stands, is
unfit to be a citizen of the United States, but the charge in the
warrent is receiving, sharing in or deriving benefits from the
earnings of a prostitute or prostitutes, and the testimony upon
that is as follows:</p> 
<p>"Q. You are convicted December 7, 1911, on the
charge of having transported Goldie Cardiff from
Seattle to San Francisco for the purpose of prosti-
tution? A. Yes.*****Q. How long did you live with
Goldie Cardiff? A. Never. She used to come around
me and my place and show money. Q. Did you ever re-
ceive earnings from her? A. No. Q. Did she ever give
you money? A. No. Q. Do you know Ethel Richards?
A. Yes. She never lived with me. Q. Did she pose
as your wife in Seattle and Spokane? A. No. Q. Was
she a prostitute? A. No. Q. Did you ever receive
any of her earnings? A. No. I threw away money. I
didn't care for their earnings. Q. Do you know
Grace Howard? A. Yes. That is the same party.
Q. You were living with another prostitute at Seattle,
were you not? A. No. I had them in my rooms when
I went out for a good time. Q. What is your business?
A. A merchant in Seattle. In Spokane at 322 Main St.
I had a pool room for about one year, me and my brother.
Q. You heard the testimony of Goldie Cardiff in the
<pb></pb>
court in the trial of your case in which she testi-
fied she turned money over to you? A. Yes. It
wasn't true."</p>
<p>Statement by Inspector Fisher:</p>
<p>"I examined the naturalization records in the
United States District Court for the Eastern Dis-
trict of Washington, and find that the records show
that Sam Plastino claimed he was born in Alteria,
Italy, Sept. 7, 1886, and came from Naples, Italy,
on the S.S. Abrumvra to the Port of New York about
the 10th day of June, 1897, and declared his inten-
tion to become a citizen of the United States before
W.H. Hare, Clerk of the United States District Court,
at Spokane, Washington, March 22, 1911. Sam Plastino
was convicted after a hearing in the United States
District Court at Tacoma, Washington, for violating
the White Slave Traffic act, in that she assisted in
the transportation of one Goldie Cardiff, from Seattle,
Washington, to San Francisco, California, for pur-
poses of prostitution. The evidence adduced at the
hearing showed that Sam Plastino had received the
earnings of Goldie Cardiff, prostitute, for several
years; that he had also received the earnings of two
other prostitutes prior and subsequent to his meeting
Goldie Cardiff."</p> 
<p>At the conclusion of the examination of the petitioner by the
Inspector, appears the following:</p> 
<p>"Q. You have a right to be represented by counsel if
you desire. A. If my brother in Spokane will get a
lawyer for me I want a lawyer. If he will not I
don't care for any. Q. Then if your brother in
Spokane does not see fit to retain a lawyer for you,
do you waive your right to be represented by counsel?
A. Yes sir. Q. By your brother, you mean Joe
Plastino? A. Yes sir."</p>
<p>This appears in different colored ribbon and prior to the cer-
tificate of the party taking the testimony. This was, in my
judgment, inserted after the testimony was completed, for if the
ribbon had been changed just at the time that this statement com-
menced, it would not have been changed back to the old ribbon
for the certificate, but the record would have been in the same
colored ribbon from the time the first change was made. The
statement may -have been made and not inserted at the time, but
the fact that it is in different colored ribbon indicates that
it mas not inserted at the time, and would at least raise a doubt
as to whether the statement was made. It was the right of the
accused to be advised of the privilege of counsel before he was
examined, and it is admitted that this information was not given
until the examination was concluded. The statement of the in-</p>
<pb></pb>
<p>spector in this record, unsupported by oath, is not testimony.
Even though it had been given under oath, it is not testimony
which would be admitted in any court, as it is the inspector's
conclusion as to certain testimony in another case. Eliminating
this from the testimony, there is no evidence which supports
the charge. All of the inquiries propounded to the petitioner
bearing upon the receipt of earnings of prostitutes were answered
in the negative, excepting the one with relation to the trans-
portation, and the court, I think, must recognize that there are
many convictions under the Mann Act where the earnings are not
the motive for the transportation.</p> 
<p>I am fully persuaded that the accused did not have a fair
trial, and that the petitioner's conviction was not predicated
upon testimony produced with relation to the charge made, but
rather upon many other charges against the accused, and which
show him to be a very undesirable person. But such fact does
not take from him the rights which are guaranteed, and all of
the facts with relation to this, or any other offense, should
be presented in the manner which the law and justice requires.
Justice never hesitates in according a fair hearing; on the con-
trary, guarantees it to the worst criminal. I think, under the
record in this case, the petitioner should be discharged.</p> 
<p>The petitioner will be discharged unless the government
appeals within twenty days, and if appeal is taken, may be re-
leased on $1000.00 recognizance, pending the review by the
appellate court.</p>
