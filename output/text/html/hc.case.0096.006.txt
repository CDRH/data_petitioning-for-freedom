I

of King aforesaid, in said City of Seattle by one T. J. Hamilton the United States
Marshal for the Territory of Oregon Washington

II

That the cause and pretense of said restraint according to the best knowledge and
information of this petitioner the said Hamilton restrains and claims the right to

deportation issuing from the court aforesaid on the 13th day of June 1889, commanding
the said Hamilton to take this petitioner into custody and deport him from the United
States and return him to British Columbia

That the said restraint is illegal in this: (1)That the said Hamilton neglects and
refuses

no provision for the Execution of the laws under which it was issued

(3) That the Deportation of the act under which said writ was issued on and in conflict
with the constitution of the United States in this and therefore to wit, for this:
that it authorizes attempts to authorize criminal prosecution

in a criminal proceeding against this petitioner wherein this petitioner was and is
denied the right of a trial by jury.

Wherefore your petitioner prays that a writ of habeas corpus may be granted directed
to the said T J Hamilton commanding him to have the body of Wa Kim before your Honor
at a time and place to be therein specified to do and receive what shall then and
there be specified considered by your Honor concerning him together with the time
and cause of his detention, and said writ; and that he may be restored to his liberty
