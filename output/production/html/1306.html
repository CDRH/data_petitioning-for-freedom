    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Earl Barringer was arrested on January 24 for seduction. On the same day, Barringer filed Habeas with attorneys William F. Curley and Lesley Woodrough, charging that police chief, John J Donahue, and detective, Charles H. Van Deusen, had no commitment to arrest him. The order for arrest came from William M. Sawyer and G. H. Whitmore of Iowa and was issued for a Jacob Barringer on January 23 and 24. A writ was issued and Barringer was released on bond for $500 with C.C. Barringer and O. D. Paudall as Sureties. The writ was sustained and Barringer was officially released from custody on February 4.</li>
