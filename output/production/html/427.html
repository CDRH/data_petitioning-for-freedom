    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Alma Zerbst petitioned for the custody of her nine-year-old illegitimate daughter Esther Gieselman on September 28, 1917. The writ of habeus corpus was served to Esther's grandparents and self-appointed guardians, William and Dora Gieselman, on September 29, 1917. They lived on 1458 South 18th Street in Omaha, Nebraska, while Alma, along with her husband Frank Zerbst, lived in Newcastle, Wyoming. According to census records found on familysearch.com, Alma's maiden name was Gieselman, and she was the daughter of William and Dora, two German immigrants. The 1910 census also provides the information that Esther's father was Belgian. The Gieselmans appeared in court on October 2, 1917, claiming that Alma Zerbst had abandoned her child shortly after its birth and was unfit to take care of her daughter. While Alma maintained that she and her husband were capable and willing to take care of the girl, the court dismissed the writ, leaving Esther in her grandparents' custody.</li>
