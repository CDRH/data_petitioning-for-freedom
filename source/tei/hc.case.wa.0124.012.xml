<p>Territory of Washington
vs.
Daniel Ainsworth
and J.S. Danford</p>

<p>And now on this 5th 
day of February A.D. 1885. The 
said Daniel Ainsworth is three
times solemnly publicly called
to come into court, as by 
this bond or recognizance duly 
taken approved and filed in 
this court he hath undertaken
 to do, but wholly 
failed to appear in court,
without sufficient cause.</p>

<p>Whereupon, on motion of 
S.C. Hyde, prosecuting attorney,
Marie N. Bennett, B.H. 
Bennett and A.N. Cannon,
the parties of the said Daniel
Ainsworth, are, by order of
the court there to be duly
solemnly and publicly called
upon to produce the said
Daniel Ainsworth here now
in court, which they wholly
fail to do, without sufficient 
excuse.</p>

<p>And is fully appearing
to the court that
by their bond or recognizance

<pb/>

duly made the 24th day
day of November A.D. 1884, and
duly taken approved and filed in 
this court on the 25th day 
of November A.D. 1884. The 
said Daniel Ainsworth as
principal and said Marie N. Bennett,
B.H. Bennett, and A.N. 
Cannon have jointly and generally
undertaken and bond
themselves to the Territory of 
Washington in the sum of
Six Thousand dollars, <unclear></unclear>
that if the said Daniel Ainsworth
be and appear in
this court on the 2nd day
of February A.D. 1885 and 
from day to day, and from
adjournment to adjournment.
and from term to term.
Thereafter, and in like manner
appear at any other
District court in said Territory, to 
which the name of said cause
might be removed, there to 
answer, to an indictment 
charging said Daniel Ainsworth
and one J.S. Danford 
with the crime of 
having obtained property of
one M.H. Whitney, by 
account of false pretenses

<pb/>

and with intent to defraud 
the said M.H. Whitney
and to <unclear>render himself</unclear>
in execution of any indictment
that might be endorsed
against him in said
matter, there to be void, 
otherwise in full force.
And it likewise fully
appearing to the court,
that the said Daniel Ainsworth
and Marie N. Bennett B.H. 
Bennett and A.N. Cannon,
were all and each of them
have violated the terms and
conditions of the said bond
or recognizance that the
said Daniel Ainsworth has
wholly failed to appear in
this court as by said bond
or recognizance required to
do, although duly called,
and that all and each of 
the said parties, though duly
called, have without any 
excuse, therefore, wholly failed
and neglected to produce
the said Daniel Ainsworth
in court. It is therefore
now here in dated and 
adjudged that the default
of said Daniel Ainsworth,
Marie N. Bennett, B.H. Bennett,
and A.N. Cannon, and each 
of them in the <unclear>premises</unclear> be
and is hereby <unclear></unclear> and 
endorsed. It is also considered
and adjudged by the court.
That the said bond or recognizance
be and is hereby
declared to be and is 
for forfeited.</p>
