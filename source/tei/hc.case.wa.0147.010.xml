<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, WESTERN DISTRICT OF
WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION 
OF MRS. GLADYS FREDRIKA FUSON,
FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.}</p>

<p>NO. 3451
PETITION.</p>

<p>Comes now Mrs. Gladys Fredrika Fuson, by her next friend-
Lona McMasters, and petitions this Honorable Court for a Writ of 
Habeas Corpus herein, and alleges as follows:-</p>

<p>That heretofore, on Friday, October 20th, 1916, the said
Mrs. Gladys Fredrika Fuson, was a resident of Port Townsend, in the 
County of Jefferson, in the State of Washington, and in the employ
of the affiant herein.</p>

<p>That on said date one M. Ruth Dahnken, claiming to be an
Officer of the Seattle Police Department, appeared in Port Townsend
and arrested the above named Mrs. Gladys Fredrika Fuson and trasported 
her to Seattle against her will and without her consent,
alleging as cause therefor that one King Dykeman had verbally instructed 
her so to do.</p>

<p>That the said King Dykeman and Blanche H. Mason and Harold 
W. Fuson and Doctor Lilburn Merrill have confined the said Mrs. 
Gladys Fredrika Fuson in a prison or jail at Broadway and Spruce
Streets, in the City of Seattle.</p>

<p>That said arrest, imprisonment and restrained were and are 
illegal and contrary to the course of common law and of the guarantees
of the Constitution of the United States concerning life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>That it was not alleged that the said Mrs. Gladys Fredrika 
Fuson had committed any offense against the laws at any time or any 
place.</p>

<p>That no warrant or information was issued</p>

<p>That, as affiant belives, that said Mrs. Gladys Fredrika 
Fuson is not being held by any sentence of any competent court.</p>

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0147.025"/>

<p>That she has not been served with any kind of process and
that when affiant asked for the reasons she could obtain no satisfaction
from the said persons, or any of them.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that the said Mrs. Gladys Fredrika
Fuson is a married woman who has been abandoned by her husband, the 
above named Harold W. Fuson; and that the said Harold W. Fuson has 
commenced suit for divorce against the said Mrs. Gladys Fredrika
Fuson, to which she has filed an answer and cross complaint in the 
Superior Court of King County, Washington.</p>

<p>That affiant belives that said proceeding was begun for 
the express purpose of preventing said Mrs. Gladys Fredrika Fuson
from making her defense to said action and for the purpose of holding 
her in involuntary imprisonment for the advantage of the said
Harold W. Fuson in said action; and affiant believes and states the
fact to be that the said Dykeman, Fuson, Mason and Merill have 
illegally conspired to deprive the said Mrs. Gladys Fredrika Fuson
of her rights of liberty guaranteed to all citizens of the United
States. Affiant further says that the said Mrs. Gladys Fredrika 
Fuson is a native born citizen of the United States and entitled to
all of the privileges and immunities of such,</p>

<p>That the affiant and the said Mrs. Gladys Fredrika Fuson 
are both poor persons, and ask to be permitted to prosecute this 
action as such.</p>

<p>STATE OF WASHINGTON
COUNTY OF KING, } SS:</p>

<p>LONA Mc MASTERS, being first fully sworn, deposes and
says: that she is the person named in the foregoing Petition as the 
next friend of the said Mrs. Gladys Fredika Fuson; that she has 
read the forgong Petition for Habeas Corpus, knows the contents
thereof and that the same is true; that the reason that affidavit
of verification is made by affiant and not by the said Mrs. Gladys
Fredrika Fuson is that the said Mrs. Gladys Fredrika Fuson is in

duress and unale to sign the same,</p>

<p>Mrs. Lona Mc Master</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 25th day of October 
1916.</p>

Notarary Public in and for the State 
of Washington, residing at Seattle</p>
