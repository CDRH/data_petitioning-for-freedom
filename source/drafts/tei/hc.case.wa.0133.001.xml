<p>The Territory 
vs. 
S.P White } </p>
<p>Charge = murder in second degree.</p>

<p>The prisoner is charged in the 
indictment with the offence 
of murder in the seond degree,
committed by killing one <del>light</del>
Amos Light Beardon in Lincoln
County in this territory.</p>

<p>That the deceased person named 
in the indictment was <del>killed 
shot by</del> murdered by a bullet 
fired from a pistol in the hands
of the defendant and that he died
from said wound a couple of days
thereafter, is not disputed by the
defense.</p>

<p>The defense maintains the position
that the fatal shot was fired by 
the prisoner in the necessary 
defense of his person. The law
secures to all the right to use
deadly weapons to save <del></del><add>themselves</add>
from death or great bodily harm.
It is not every apprehended danger
however that will justify a
killing in self defense. He must
be a serious danger <del>to the life</del> 
and one likely in the apprehension
of a reasonable man, <del>from the</del>to 
result in loss of life or great bodily</p>

<pb/>

<p>injury. The danger must <add>appear to</add> be
imminent and immediate,
not a contingent danger. <del>or one</del>
<del>that</del> but it used not be real,
if the facts and circumstances
were such as to indulge a reasonable 
man to believe that it
actually existed.</p>
<p>A person, in no way in the wrong,
need not go out of his way to 
avoid danger, and being in a 
position adhere he has the right
to be, may stead on his rights
and rebel unlawful assault
with such force as may be necessary.
even to the taking of human life,
if it be necessary, to use so much
force to save his own life or to
save his person form great bodily 
harm.</p>
<p>A person, who, by his own aggressions,
 brings on a difficulty
does not stand in the same
position. If he can he cannot
avoid a conflict, and if he
finds himself in danger and can
avoid it either by retreating or 
by calling for assistance, or by
yielding to a just demand upon
the part of the person or persons
attacking him, and instead of
avoiding the danger repels it by</p>

<pb/>

<p>taking life, he is not justified, 
<add>on the ground of act of defense</add>
But if a person in the wrong as I 
have stated, has avoided a 
conflict by using means in his 
power and still he finds himself 
in <add>danger of his life or of</add> great bodily harm, 
and he can do nothing other
or further to save himself, then
he may use it to his right of
self defense, but with this
qualification, that he must 
not have put himself in the
wrong, for the purpose of causing
a difficulty and giving himself
the appropriately, <del>to take the life,
of his assailant</del>after declining
as far as he could, to take life.
The law permits the taking
 of human life only on the
ground of necessity and it
does not permit <del>of</del> <add>a</add> person to
<del>unlawfully</del> <add>designed</add> create the necessity
and then to have the benefit
of it as self defense.</p>

<p>
I think I may tell you
that the act of the defendant
in taking the revolver from
the young man <add><del>and keeping it</del></add> Frank Beardon,
<add>under the circumstances shown by the testimony on both sides </add>
<del>was</del> and keeping it was an unlawful
act and an act of offensive
<add>and provocation</add> as to said Frank Beardon
and his older brother, the
<unclear></unclear>, which could pre
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
vent
him from having the right to
kill either of them in an <unclear></unclear>
arising out of such unlawful
act, until he had retreated as
for as he could or retreated to
every other expedient to avoid
the killing
</p>

<p>
If the defendant could have <add>Dufuly</add> retreated
from the house by the back door,
after the assault upon him, if
there was any such assault
before the killing, he should
have done so.
</p>

<p>
If he could have, called by <unclear></unclear>
to his assistance and found
himself, he should have done so. 
If he could have yielded to
the just and rightful <del>and</del>
demanding the deceased to whom
the property of the younger brother
of the deceased, and thus have
avoided the necessity for a
ruling, he should have done
so.
</p>

<p>
If he determined that he could
keep the <unclear></unclear> of Frank Beardon
and that under the circumstances
he would obtain it, and that he
would want to any force, even to
the taking of life, to maintain
his possession of it, and that
it was with this preconceived
</p>

<pb/>

<p>2</p>

<p>
determination that he took the
life of the deceased then there
is no element of self defense
in this case no matter how just
his actual danger may have
been.
</p>

<p>
But upon the other hand, <del>although</del>
if he had no such preconceived
design, and there was an attack
upon him before the shooting,
which was no peice and
impetuous that he could not avoid
it or retreat from it, and in
repelling such attack it was necessary
 to take life, to save his
own life, or to save himself
from great bodily harm, then
the element of his <unclear>injustice</unclear> wrong
could be eliminated and you
would be justified in finding <del>him
not guilty</del> that he acted in self
defense,
</p>

<p>
If the Territory, has made it
a case of unlawful killing,
then the duty of establishing
that such killing was in
self defense, <unclear>derives</unclear> upon
the defendant.
