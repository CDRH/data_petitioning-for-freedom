In the District Court of the Third Judicial District holding terms at Port Townsend
W.Ty.

In the matter of the Application of Ms Lee Sing Wot for a writ of Habeas Corpus }
Order Granting Writ

Upon reading and filing the petition of Mrs Lee Sing Wot, duly signed and verified,
whereby it appears that she is illegally inprisoned and restrained of her liberty
by Charles M Bradshaw Collector of Customs for the District of Puget Sound of Washington
and Oregon at the Custom House in the City of Port Townsend, Jefferson County Washington
Territory, and stating wherein the alleged illegality consists from which it appears
to me that a writ of Habeas Corpus ought to issue, it is ordered that a writ of Habeas
Corpus issue out of and under the seal of this Court, directed to said Charles M.
Bradshaw, Collector as aforesaid, commanding him to have the body of the said Mrs
Lee Sing Wot before me, in the Court, at the City of Seattle, in the County of King,
in the Territory of Washington, on the 30th day of April AD 1889, at ten o'clock A.M.
of that day, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered concerning
the said petitioner Mrs Lee Sing Wot, together with the time and cause of her detention,
and that you have then and there the said writ.

Dated April 20th 1889
C.H. Hanford
Judge
