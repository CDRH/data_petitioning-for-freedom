    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On September 12, 1920, Opal Rogers was arrested on the south side of Omaha, Nebraska, and charged with being an inmate of an ill-governed house. She was found guilty in the South Side Police Court by Omaha Police Magistrate Charles E. Foster. Opal Rogers then paid the $200.00 appeal bond set by Foster. On September 13, 1920, the case respondents Marshall Eberstein, Omaha Police Chief, and Alta Berger, Matron and Superintendent of the Omaha Detention Hospital, illegally detained Opal Rogers at the Detention Hospital of Omaha and subjected her to forced physical examinations instead of releasing her to the District Court of Douglas County after the appeal. On September 16, 1920, Opal Rogers&#x2019; attorneys, Jamieson H. Sullivan and Eugene D. Sullivan, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and argued that the respondents violated Amendment 5 of the Constitution by subjecting Opal Rogers to forced physical examinations. The petition was allowed by Judge Charles Goss that day and the Douglas County Sheriff, Michael L. Clark, delivered the writ to the respondents on September 17, 1920, by judge&#x2019;s order. On September 20, 1920, Marshall Eberstein and Alta Berger responded to the writ and provided copies of the commitments they received from Foster and Dr. J. F. Edwards, Omaha Health Commissioner, that ordered the respondents to take Opal to the Detention Hospital of Omaha in order to subject her to forced physical examinations to ascertain whether or not she had contracted a venereal disease. After the hearing, Judge A. C. Troup ordered the respondents to release Opal Rogers from custody and she was released based on the results of the examination. </li>
