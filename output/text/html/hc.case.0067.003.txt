In the District Court holding terms at Seattle in King County, Washington Territory.

In the matter of the application of Chin Chung (a Chinaman) for a writ of Habeas Corpus.

On reading and filing the petition of Chin Chung duly signed and verified, whereby
it appears that, he is illegally imprisoned and restrained of his liberty by John
H. McGraw, Sheriff of said King County, at said King County, and stating wherein the
illegality consists from which it appears to me that a writ of habeas corpus ought
to issue. It is ordered that, a writ of habeas corpus issue out of and under the seal
of this court, directed to the said John H. McGraw, commanding him to have the body
of the said Chin Chung before me in the Court Room of the District  Court at Tacoma
Pierce County in said Territory on the Eighteenth 20h day of November AD 1882 at two
ten Oclock A P.M. of that day, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered
concerning the said Chin Chung together with the time and cause of his detention and
that he have there and then the said writ and in the meantime he be admitted to bail
in the sum of sixty five dollars.

Dated the Eighteenth day of November 1882

Roger S GreeneJudge of said Court
