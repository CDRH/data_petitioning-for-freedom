    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In July 1918, Ruth Livingston was arrested and convicted with being an inmate of an ill-governed house and sentenced to twenty days in jail, then subsequently committed to the Omaha Detention Home for Girls. Ruth filed a bond for an appeal, which was approved by the Police Magistrate and authorized for her release. The Detention Home for girls refused to recognize the order and did not release Ruth. The petitioner stated she was not charged for the crime of prostitution or being in danger of exposing others to infectious diseases. In addition, Ruth stated she was forced to submit to medical treatment against her will. Judge Willis G. Sears authorized the petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus. The writ was returned and not served as it was recalled by the plaintiff's attorney, likely because Ruth had been released from the Detention Home by that point and the case was dismissed for need of prosecution. </li>
