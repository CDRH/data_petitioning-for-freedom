<p> Be it Remembered that on the 
Seventeenth day of December in the year Eighteen hundred 
and twenty five before me Peter Ferguson a Justice of the 
Peace in and for the County of St. Louis, personally came 
and appeared <unclear> Jabez </unclear> Warner who lodged information <strike> upon </strike> 
before me <strike> that </strike> upon oath that he is well informed &amp; does 
believe that John Plackett &amp;         Plackett his wife have 
a certain Female slave of the age of <unclear></unclear> Eight to Eleven 
years <strike> of age </strike> whose name is to him unknown that 
from the barbarous &amp; inhuman treatment as has been repre-
sented to him (and as he believes to be the truth) he thinks 
that the said child is in danger of being brought to a prema-
ture death. and that therefore a warrant ought to issue to 
cause the said Plackett &amp; his wife to be brought before some 
competent authroity to restrain them from the continuance 
of such barbarity. to place the slave who has been thus 
inhumanly treated out of their power &amp; to cause them 
to give security to keep the peace towards the good people 
of this state &amp; to such others as the <strike> proper </strike> law may 
require &amp; to be otherwise dealt with according to laws </p>
