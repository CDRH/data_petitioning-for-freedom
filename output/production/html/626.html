    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In April 1920, H.J. Finch petitioned for a writ of Habeas Corpus on the grounds he was being unlawfully detained of his liberty by Michael L. Clark, and E,J. West, Sheriffs of Douglas County, Nebraska, and Osceola, Iowa, respectively. Finch was indicted by a grand jury for cheating by fraud and being a fugitive of justice from Iowa. Finch represented he was a member of the commission firm, Jackson-Signall, and engaged in an agreement with S.R. Bell for the purchase of 400 sheep. Upon receiving the sheep, Finch alleged they were not as represented and rejected the sale. The petitioner asserted that Bell agreed Finch would take the sheep into his possession, sell them for what he could and remit the best possible price to Bell. The grand jury found that the notion Finch was a member of Jackson-Signall was untrue, and Finch attempted to defraud Bell. Judge A.C. Troup denied the writ and ruled Finch was confined in a legal manner be re-committed to custody. Attorneys for the petitioner motioned for a new trial on the grounds the judgment was contrary to evidence and law. On appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court, the judgment was affirmed. </li>
