    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Richard Lloyd Green was the minor son of Pearl Alma Bentley who on April 14th, 1923, submitted a petition of habeas corpus on his behalf. In this petition, she claimed that Richard was being unlawfully held by his father, Edgar B. Green. Pearl stated that in September 1919 she divorced Edgar and was awarded custody of Richard, and that Richard would be able to visit Edgar during summer vacations. Pearl asserted that she had provided Richard a good home and was ready to continue that upon his return to her. Pearl asserted that Edgar was not a fit parent. He was addicted to alcohol. He would often be very intoxicated and in this state he would become neglectful towards Richard. Pearl alleged that Edgar threatened to remove Richard from Omaha (thus out of the court's jurisdiction). She requested that Edgar produce Richard before the court and that she be granted custody of him. The judge granted Pearl's petition, and the sheriff brought Richard before the court. On April 14, 1923, Richard was turned over to the custody of Pearl on the condition of her appearance at the hearing on April 16th. On April 30th the case was dismissed with prejudice, with parties to pay their own costs. The 1930 census shows Richard living with his father.</li>
