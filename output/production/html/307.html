    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In May 1885, Arthur Powell petitioned for a writ of Habeas Corpus on the basis he was illegally restrained of his liberty by E.J. Whittier, Sheriff of Spokane County. Powell, along with Asa Shuck, was charged with stealing a stallion worth $40. Each were granted recognizance in the sum of $250, however, both failed to post bond and were kept in custody awaiting their appearance. Powell's petition alleged the charge of "horse stealing" was not an offense against the laws of the Washington Territory and that testimony showed no probable cause that Powell was guilty. The fate of the petition and the fate of Arthur Powell is unknown. </li>
