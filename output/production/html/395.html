    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Alfred Woods was taken into custody for failing to give bonds as a witness called for another case (United States v William Jameson). He was taken by the U S Marshall to McNeil Island Penitentiary. His attorneys stated there was no order holding him and his health required him to be let out ("valvular disease of the heart and consequent inlargement of the same from chronic bronchitis and general debility" stated by the doctor). The petition also stated that he was poor and couldn't pay the court dues. The petition was granted, but nothing is further known if the petitioner was released.</li>
