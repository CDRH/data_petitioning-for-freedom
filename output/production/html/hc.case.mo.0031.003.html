cause of her imprisonment, confinement and detention if any such exist; and that upon the inspection thereof, and a hearing of the case; the 
said Frances may be discharged from such confinement and returned to her friends, and to her 
liberty; and to have such other order, or decree as she 
may be entitled to in the premises</p>
