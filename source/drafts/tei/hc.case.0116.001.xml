<p>Albert Wiley
v
Kiskick. } Error from Douglas Corcuty
AFromed</p>

<p>Syllabus</p>
<p>By the Court Kingman C.F.</p>

<p>1 A person who had served as a talesman in the trial of a cause at the same term of the court was placed on the regular panel in place of a prior excused. He was challenged by defendant because of his <del>habing used som</del> previous service as talesman. The court reminded the challenge, and he was then challenged peremptorily held. That the court used in overling the challengers, but in as much as the record does not show that the defendant exhausted his peremptory challenges <del>a new trial</del> will not be
<del>adued for</del> reversed for an ever which was caused by the action of the defendant.</p>
<p>2) It is not ever to change that an illegal act has been committed by the defendant, when the answer of defendant admits facts that show he did certain acts which must be held illegal</p>
<p>3 It's not ever to change the jury that they are authorized to give exemplary damages where the elements of fraud, malice, gros negligence, or oppression mingle in and form pact of the cause of action.</p>

<p>Syllabus.</p>

<p>pact of the cause of action

<pb facs="hc.case.0116.003"/>

<p>Albert Wiley
v
Kiskick
Kingman</p>

<p>The first error alleged occured in selecting a jury. The person was challenged for cause on the ground that he had once already errored on a <unclear>jury</unclear> on a talesman in the treat of a cause at the same team of the conet, the court overrated the challenge, This was errer. Code sec 270, It appears that after the person had served as a talesman he had ben called to seen as a regular juror for te term in place of a juror excused. This made no difference, the law remained the same, the challenge should have been allowed, the beneficient objects of the section could not to frees hated by placing a man on the regular paned who could not serve on a penny if challenged. The object of the law is to get rid of professional jurors, a most pertiferous set as every lawyer knows, and this could not be done away with by a sheriff or court, by <del>mutting could</del> putting such a jurer on the regular <unclear></unclear>. The juror was afterwards challenged peremptoily by plantiff in then and there removed from the jury. The record does not show that the defendant exhausted his persemptory challenges. Then funds bring the case directly within the ruling of thi court in the case of Merton v The State 1st <unclear></unclear> 468, "By the means the defendant seems

effectivally to have relived himself from the grievance of which he complas" and the case will not be eserved for an error of the court which the paty cured by his own action. </p>
<p>The next serer claimed in that the court used in the chargs to the jury and special attention in called to the 6th intention which is as follows
"That the letter of instruction of communication Mix, does not pistfy the illegal act of Agent Wiley. He is answerable in damages to the plantiff for any illegal act."</p>
