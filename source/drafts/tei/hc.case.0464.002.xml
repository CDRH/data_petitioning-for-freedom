Prosecuting Attorney. "

(3)

<pb/>

which indictment is alleged to be framed and founded under
Section 57 of the Code of Washington, known as the Second
Volumbe of Hill's Code.

That upon the said indictment there was a trial had before
jury of the County of King, and the jury in that said cause,
Number 864 rendered a verdict of guilty.

That upon the said verdict an alleged judgment was rendered
against the defendant by one of the Judges of the Superior 
Court of King County, in words and figures following, to-wit:

IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON FOR THE COUNTY OF
KING.

Monday March 26, 1894.

The State of Washington,
864
vs
Adolph Krug, impleaded with
Henry Furhman,

Motion denied,
Sentence, etc.

And now this cause comes on for further hearing on defendant's 
motion to set aside verdict and for a new trial, pursuant to continuance,
thereof, the State appearing by the Prosecuting Attorney,
John F.Miller, and defendant appearing in person and by his Counsel,
Messrs. Lewis, Gilman &amp; Fishback. And now upon due consideration 
thereof said defendant's motion for a new trial is denied, to
which ruling defendant excepts and the exception is allowed, defendant
thereupon moves the court for arrest of judgment; which motion
on consideration thereof is denied. Exception taken by defendant
is allowed.

And now upon motion of the Prosecuting Attorney the said defendant,
Adolph Krug, is brought before the bar of the court to be 
sentenced.

And no legal cause being shwon or appearing to the court why
judgment should not be pronounced upon the defendant, the court
sentences the said defendant, Adolph Krug, to be punished by confinement 
at hard labor in the Penitentiary of the State of Washington
for a term of Seven (7) years and to pay all costs of this action
Defendant's counsel therupon give notice in open court 
of their appeal from the verdict and the judgment of this court to
the Supreme Court of the State of Washington. And the Court fixes
and determines the amount of defendant's Appeal Bond in the sum of
$5.000.00

<pb/>

which judgment was rendered on the 26th day of March
1894.

V1.

That the said alleged judment is still in existence.
That the same has been appealed from to the Supreme Court of
the State of Washington, and the said judgment affirmed, and is
now in existence and in force and full effect. That under said
judgment the said Moyer assumes to imprison and to keep imprisoned
and to have imprisoned in the penitentiary of the State of
Washington this petitioner, and now threatens and continues to
threaten to seize the body of this petitioner from his present
imprisonment and convey him to further imprisonment, to-wit:
to the penitentiary of the state of Washington, where he is
to be held for the petiod of Seven years.

V11.

That the imprisonment of this petitioner by the said
Moyer, or any other person, under the said alleged judgment
and proceeding would wholly be contrary to petitioner's right
as a citizen of the United States, and particularly in violation
of your petitioner's rights as a citizen of the United States,
contrary to the laws of the United States, in violation of the
Constitution of the United States and directly against the
special right and immunity and exemption from imprisonment
without due process of law, as provided by the Constitution of
the United States, in behalf of this petitioner as a citizen of
the United States; all of which more particularly appears in
the following, detailed, manifested and exhibited to the Court,
viz:

V111.

That the Constitution of the United States prescribes
in Article VI., that "No person shall be held, etc., to answer

(5)

<pb/>

the charge of an infamous crime without due process of law
###". And the further provision that "Such person when held
or attempted to be held shall by indictment be informed of the
nature and cause of the accusation". That this provision was in
pursuit of the Common Law and meant that the facts and circumstances 
of the charge shall be presented to the defendant in
complete detail, that he may understand the same and prepare to
defend himself with the same detail essential to meet the charge
against him.

1X.

That the State of Washington when admitted into the
Union was admitted by express contract in the Enabling Act
that the Constitution of the State of Washington should not be
repugnant to or inconsistent with the Federal Constitution.
That in view and in pursuit of this provision and mandate, 
the Constitution of the state of Washington did provide and 
does now provide and at all times hereinafter state it was
provided that "In Criminal prosecutions the accused shall have
the right ### to demand the nature and cause of the accusation 
against him; to have a copy thereof, etc.", being Section
22 of the Constitution.

X.

That notwithstanding such provisions, this petitioner was
arraigned upon the form of alleged indictment hereinbefore stated
and immediately in the Superior Court demurred to the same upon
the ground that it did not state the facts nor inform him of the 
nature and cause of his accusation; that the Code of Washington
provided that in all criminal offenses, being the laws of
Washington, and in all informations or indictments, the information
or the indictment must contain ### a statement of the acts
constituting the offense, in ordinary and concise language,
without repetitions, and in such a manner as to enable a person of

(6)

<pb/>

common understanding to know what is intended", being section
5944 of the Code of '96.

That the demurrer of petitioner to the alleged indictment
for the reason that it did not inform him of the nature and
cause of the accusation was overruled on the ground and for
the reason that in the particular case in which your petitioner
was indicted and arraigned, such was not necessary; that it
was only necessary in such case to charge him in a "general way",
as provided by the Act of the Legislature of the State of
Washington, of December 20th, 1889 and contained in Hill's
Code, Dec. 58, Vol. 2, prescribing and providing that in the
particular offenses provided for in Sec. 57 of the Code of
Washington, the special rule shall obtain, and that notwithstanding
the Constitution and the general laws of the state
and the Constitution of the United States, in all provided
and guaranteed that in all offenses the special acts and the
nature and cause specifically of the accusation was to be
presented to the defendant, that in the present instance and
instances where the defendant was charged, and in his case,
and in the indictment with which he was charged, and as to the
offense with which he was charged, it was only necessary "to
allege generally the general fact," without "specifying any 
further particulars," and that notwithstanding such, "on the
trial thereof, all other facts of every nature could be proven
against the defendant, though the same had been in no wise
specifically set up or plead, or the nature or the cause of
the same at any time set forth by presentment, information or
indictment."

X1.

That upon the overruling of the demurrer your petitioner
was put to trial upon the said indictment, and testimony ofered
upon the said indictment, which was in no wise a part of the
same or could be a part of the same, and which, from the

(7)

<pb/>

manner of the indictment it was impossible for your petitioner
to know could have been intended or expected. Your petitioner
duly objected to the same because the same was not plead and
because the same was not set forth, all of which objections
were overruled and exceptions duly preserved. Your petitioner
moved in due time for Bill of Particulars of the said indictment,
asking that the Bill of Particulars should set forth
what was intended to be charged specifically against the
defendant under the general allegation of the alleged indictment,
which petition and a request and motion for Bill of
Particulars was denied to your petitioner, to which there was
exception duly preserved by your petitioner. That the cause
proceeded to trial, and upon the said indictment, your petitioner
being in no wise informed as to the manner of the cause
to be submitted against him, was unable to prepare for his
defense, and was surprised at the nature of the testimony;
had prepared his defense along the line of what he believed
was the nature of the cause and charge as he had gathered it
from common rumor and common report, but the evidence introduced
under the said alleged indictment was of such a nature so foreigh
to what he believed and understood that he was wholly 
misled as to his defense, and at the close of the case of the
State, so informed the Judge of the Court, and made his showing
of such surprise, and objected to the consideration of the
testimoy because of such surpise and injustice,which objection
was overruled; duly made motion for time in which to prepare
his defense, submitting himself to any reasonable time the
Court would give, even the short period of 12 hours, which was
denied your petitioner, to which your petitioner excepted.
Your petitioner being unable to proceed further, having no
witnesses, his preparation having been along the lines
different from that of the evidence introduced against him,

(8)

<pb/>

and having no opportunity to prepare his defense in view of
the manner of the prosecution, was compeled and thus forced
to submit himself as a citizen of the United States to the
prosecution against him without opportunity to meet the same
and to defend the same, and a jury under the instruction of the
Judge and acting under the authority of the Court, rendered
a verdict upon the said testimony against your petitioner,
upon the testimony offered against him and because and forsooth 
your petitioner could offer no testimony in his behalf
for want of time or opportunity to prepare his defense; your
petitioner having full and complete defense, and your petitioner
being then as he now alleges, not guilty of the charge
against him.

X11.

That thereafter your petitioner was by the Superior 
Court of King County sentenced to imprisonment upon the said
unjust verdict, and from the said judgment did duly appeal to
the Supreme Court of the State of Washington, and therein
his said appeal presented his alleged wrongs, and particularly
that as a citizen of the United States he had been proceeded
against by the state of Washington and his liberty taken without
due pocess of law, in that to-wit: that the alleged
indictment in no wise conformed to the Constitution of the
State of Washington or of the Constitution of the United States
in apprising him of the nature and cause of his accusation,
but constituted a trap to seize and allure and subsequently
to destroy his liberty as such citizen of the United States,
contrary to his protest and against the Constitution of the
United States and the laws therein.

X111.

That the cause came on duly for hearing before the
Supreme Court of the State of Washington: that the said

(9)

<pb/>

Supreme Cout of the State of Washington sustained the contention
of Appellant, admitting that the said alleged indictment 
against him did not conform to the Code of Washington in that
particular portion and part commanding that it shall state the
acts and facts constituting the offense. That the aleged
indictment did not conform to the constitutional provision
both of the state of Washington and of the United States,
requiring that the defendant, your petitioner, be informed of
the nature and cause of his accusation. That the
Supreme Court admitted, adjudicated and adjudged that under the
law generally any person would have a right to have the nature
and cause of the accusation set out and presented, and
particularly if he were a citizen of the United States; that
his rights as such citizen were to demand and to have the
nature and cause of the accusation specifically set out,
that he may be able to prepare and meet the same and defend
against the same; but the Supreme Court of the State of
Washington further decided and held that as it was true, and
your petitioner alleges it so to be, that as to your petitioner
and the cause with which he was charged and the offense which
was alleged against him and the crime with which he was
charged, the Legislature of the State of Washington in
behalf of the state of Washington, had by the Act of its
Legislature of December 29th, 1889, paragraph 2, as shown in
the 2nd Volume of Hill's Code, Sec. 58, that it was only
necessary to set forth generally that your petitioner had
committed the crime alleged against him, and that no other
details or specifications of any other or further particulars

(10).
