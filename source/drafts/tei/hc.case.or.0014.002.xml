Attorneys for Petitioner</p>

<p>Residence and Post Office Address,

<pb/>

<p>In the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for Marion County
Department number Two.</p>

<p>In the matter of the application for a writ of habeas corpus
for
Mollie A. Calhoun, a minor.</p>

<p>Comes now Frank Smith and respectfully petitions Hon.
R.P.Boise, Judge of the above entitled Court and shows the
following facts, towit:-</p>

<p>That the above named Mollie A. Calhoun is a minor of the
age fourteen years. That Joseph Calhoun is her father and that
he is now and for some time past is and has been at Salisaw,
Indian Territory. That said Joseph Calhoun <add>on or about September 1902</add> entrusted your
pettitioner with the care, custody, charge and control of
said Mollie A. Calhoun and that your petitioner <add>ever since has been and</add> is now entitled
to the care, charge, custody and control of said Mollie A. Calhoun.
That your <del>petioner</del> petitioner heretofore had an agreement
with W.E.Miller and Mrs. W.E. Miller that they would take
said Mollie A. Calhoun to their home in Salem, Oregon, and
would treat her kindly, clothe her, properly care for her and
send her to school. That said parties have not treated her
kindly nor properly cared for her nor sent her to school, but they are
overworking her and requiring her to work all the time without
any compensation and making a slave out of her. That said
parties are not suitable persons to keep said Mollie A. Calhoun.
That said Mrs.W.E.Miller has threatened said Mollie A.
Calhoun that she would kill her if she did not do as she was
ordered to do. That said Mrs.S.E.Miller will not permit your
petitioner to talk to said Mollie A.Calhoun, except in said
Miller's presence and hearing. That your petitioner on March
23, 1903, demanded possession of said Mollie A.Calhoun but
said Mrs.S.C.Miller refuses to deliver her up to your petitioner</p>

<p>Page 1.</p>

<p>Petition.</p>

<pb/>

<p>although your petitioner has personaly and duly demanded
such possession. That your petitioner is the <add>next friend</add> of
said Mollie A.Calhoun and that your petitioner made such demand
for her possession under and by virtue of the authority
and direction and request of her <add>said</add> father Joseph Calhoun.
That said W.E.Miller and Mrs.W.E.Miller are now wrongfully
and unlawfully imprisoning and restraining said Mollie A.Calhoun
of her liberty at Salem in Marion County,Oregon, and that said
Mollie A.Calhoun is not imprisoned or restrained by virtue
of any order, judgment, decree, or other officer of the United States, or
by virtue of the judgment, order, process, or decree of any competent
tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction or by virtue
of an execution issued upon such judgment or decree. That
said W.E.Miller and Mrs W.E. Miller have no reason, cause or
pretense for the detaining, imprisoning or restraining said
Mollie A.Calhoun. That said detaining, imprisoning or restraining
of said Mollie A.Calhoun has not been already adjudged,
upon a prior writ of habeas corpus, to the knowledge <add>or  belief</add> of your
<del>petioner</del> petitioner.</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays an order that a writ of
habeas corpus be issued directed to said W.E.Moller and Mrs.
W.E. Miller commanding them and each of them to bring and have
the body of said Mollie A.Calhoun before your Honor at a time
therein specified to do and receive what shall then and there
be considered by your Honor concerning her <del>thee</del> the said Mollie A.
Calhoun together with the time and cause of her detention, and
said writ; that she may be restored to her liberty and the custody
of your petitioner.</p>
