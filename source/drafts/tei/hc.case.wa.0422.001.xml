house and home of said Nicholas

consent and without any provocation
or cause whatsoever;
that the said Olive Brown on said
13th day of May 1887, tolf her said
husband that she would leave</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>his house and home and that
she would not live with him here
after and would henceforth
restrain away from him together
with said infants; that said
Olive Brown on said 15th day of May
1887, left the bed and board of
said Nicholas Brown and took
with her Alexander Brown and
George Brown the infant children
aforesaid without the consent
of her said husband said
Nicholas Brown; that said Olive
Brown took said infant children
with her to the aforesaid place
in Skagit County, and does now
restrain them of their liberty
and refuses to give them to said
Nicholas Brown the father of said
children; that the said Nicholas
Brown is <unclear></unclear> able to educate
and support the said infants
than their mother said Olive

<p>Wherefore your petitioner
pray that a Writ of Habeas
Corpus may be granted, directed
to the said Olive Brown, 
commanding her to have the</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>bodies of said Alexander Brown
and George Brown infants, before
your honor at a time and place
therein to be specified, to do and
receive what shall then and there
be committed by your honor concerning
them, together with
the time and cause and authority
