<p><del/>That so 
great was the prejudice against defendant
during said examination that several times
when the public prosecutor vehemently denounced 
defendant the large crowd in 
attendance <del>charged</del>, stamped their feet
in approval and when finally defendant 
was by said Justices held
without bail for murder in the
first degree the large crowd of people
in attendance again manifested
their approval by stomping their feet
loudly, affiant further alleges upon
information and belief that at that
time large numbers of men were
engaged in railroad building in
this county and especially in the
south part of the county and that the
vehement ascertion that defendant 
shot deceased because he wore blue overalls. 
Together with false and exagerated 
statements of the facts, were
reported among and by them not
only among themselves but
with the people of the county and
great prejudice thereby engendered
against defendant that during
and of the time of said examination and

<pb/>

thereafter for a long time the people of the city
of Spokane Falls and of various portions
of this county were greatly excited concerning 
this case and it was a thereof 
constant discussion among all classes 
of people, and many false and exaggerated
statements, purporting to be the fact, in the
case told and repeated until believed
and this affiant at that time and many
times since has held conversations
with officials of Spokane County
about this case who have expressed
opinions and prejudices against
defendant and belief of her guilt
and affiant has been told by others of the instance
of great and almost universal prejudice 
against defendant <del>against 
defendant</del> That so great was the prejudice 
against defendant at time
of such examination that applicant
was denounced by some persons for
defending her in the courts, <del>that
applicant is informed and believes
and upon such information and
belief <unclear></unclear></del></p>

<pb/>

<p>That certain <del>when</del> citizens of Spokane
County, whose names are to applicant unknown 
attempted to procure official counsel
partial the public prosecutor to prosecute 
defendant and on the habeas corpus
application of defendant to admit her
to bail special counsel did appear and
resist the public prosecutor but
whether <unclear/> or from employment
affiant does not know.</p>

<p>That a few days after the said justices had
held defendant without bail for murder
in the first degree affiant on behalf of defendant 
procured a writ of habeas corpus 
to issue from the judge of this court to
admit defendant to bail and in said
application the evidence taken before
said justices and by them issued
to writing was considered by
said judge and defendant thereupon
admitted to bail in the sum of $5,000 that so
great was the prejudice of <del>deft</del> the people of
the county against defendant that they
<unclear/> the judge very much for
allowing defendant bail, and
as affiant is reliably informed
threatened to burn <add>or hang</add> him in effigy
therefore; and so great was the prejudice
and opinion against defendant that

<pb/>

many persons declined to go on her
"bail" though amply secured, for fear of
public unrest and opinion and great
difficulty for her on account of such
prejudice that concerning such <unclear/>
to bail the said Daily <add>&amp; Weekly</add> Review published
in both its daily and weekly edition
the statement – a copy of which is attached hereto
marked "c". That concerning said case
and the facts thereof said daily &amp; weekly
Review also published at about the time
of publication attached hereto and marked D. E.</p>


<p>The Spokane Chronicle another weekly
published paper
<add>in Spokane Falls of general circulation</add>  published matters concerning
this case and the killing of Finch
Copies of which are attached hereto
and marked with date of their publication 
and by F.G. H all to the prejudice of deft.</p>

<p>Another fact which tended greatly to
excite and prejudice the people of the county
against this defendant is the fact that
at the time of the killing of Finch an election
was pending in nearly in all of the precincts
of this county <del>and about</del> and in Spokane
Falls and about to take place, upon
the question of the prohibiting the sale
of intoxicating liquors and a great

<pb/>

effort was being made by <del>all of the</del> those
in favor and against prohibition
for the supremacy of their respective
views at such election. The advocates
of prohibition at Spokane Falls a
night of his after the killing to wit-
June 27, 1886, held a public meeting
which was attended by several hundred 
citizens of Spokane County, and
which meeting was addressed by
one Narcissa White, are eloquent and
experienced lecturer on temperance and
in her address in that might she <add>as applicant is informed and believes</add>
addressing the guilt of defendant 
pointed to the killing of Finch as
an example of the evils of <unclear/>
saloons, and affiant is informed
this cause argument was used by
advocates of prohibition generally in
this county before such election and
that many anti-prohibitionists
were greatly concerned at defendant
for having as was alleged afforded
this argument against them
and that is all tended greatly
to the prejudice of defendant with 
many good people of the county 
so much so that applicant has heard of
prominent citizens and temperance

<pb/>
men of Spokane County wihtin the last
three weeks say in speaking of the act
of the judge of this court in admitting
defendant to bail and referring to the
case and to what was termed the
saloon element "<unclear/> and when one of
them kills a man they let her out
on bail," words to that effect
and in Sep. 23, 1886 the Spokane Tribue
a weekly newspaper then published
in Cheney, Spokane County, published
the Following publication reference to
this case.</p>

<p>"The County Commissioners have had
to increase our taxes 2 mills this year to
pay for the prosecuting of the 12 saloon
- Ray Raymond - criminals, might
have during the last twelve months from
Spokane."</p>

<p>[on editorial page, Sept. 23, 1886]</p>

<p>Which said Tribune is the acknowledged
organ of the prohibitionists, of this 
county, <del>of</del> and of very general circulation 
as affiant is informed
and believes throughout every
portion of Spokane County, and
very influential with its readers</p>

<p>That from conversations had with

<pb/>

people of said county and from all of the
information affiant has been able to
obtain he believes that this prejudice
against defendant has not died
out but is still in existence among
the people of the county, both men and
women, and so wide-spread and
universal that defendant cannot
guard against it in the selections
of a jury and the prejudice is so great 
and intense and so existant
among all classes of people of the
county that even if a jury could be
obtained free from prejudice, which 
affiant does not believe possible,
under the circumstances, affiant
fears that such prejudice would
be so strong and apparent as to
affect a jury before the conclusion
of the trial, these false rumors and
reports, and this prejudice are especially
dangerous to defendant in this case 
on account of the charges against
her, and the nature of the defense
thereto which must not largely
in the absence of criminal intent
at the time of the shooting, affiant
has informed himself of the true facts
in this case and of defendant

<pb/>

defense having as verily as possible and
believes she has a good and meritous
defense herein and one that can be
made available if she is given a fair
trial.</p>
