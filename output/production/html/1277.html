    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In 1900 Maude Cooper, petitioner, left Kenneth in the care of the Child Savings Institute in Omaha temporarily. John Silas, the defendant, claimed that Kenneth Cooper was then legally adopted in 1901 and he and his wife, Mary, have legal custody of the child. Maude stated she never consented to a change in custody of Kenneth to John Silas. She was also not contacted with a notice of Kenneth's adoption by John Silas. Maude then, in 1903, filed for a writ of habeas corpus so that Kenneth Cooper can return to her care. An order allowing writ of habeas corpus in favor of Maude Cooper and her son, Kenneth Cooper, is provided by Judge Read in 1903. </li>
