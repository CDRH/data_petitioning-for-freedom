<p>Testimony of Neil Smyth</p>

<p>Yesterday morning about 6 or 7 o'clock John Dugan came to <del></del> my house and told <del></del> me that Mary Teller had killed Frank "meaning" Franklin Teller he said she shot him twice I asked him what he was going to do about it and he said he was going round and tell the neighbors about it I then went over and told John Howden and William Howden and we went over there and saw Frank Teller lying between his house and gate dead There was gun lying about five feet from him with both barrells cocked and caps on both tubes that have never been shot I also saw a board about one inch thick and four inches wide and three or four feet long with blood on it lying near him I dont think he could of fallen with the gun in his hands with out discharging it</p>
