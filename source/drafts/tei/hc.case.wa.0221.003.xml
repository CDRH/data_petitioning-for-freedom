<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, IN AND FOR THE WESTERN 
DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the 
Application of CHIN QUOCK WAH, 
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. )
No. <gap/>
Further Amended Petition
of CHIN QUOCK WAH, by and 
through ADAM BEELER, of the 
Law Firm of Beeler &amp; Sullivan,
his Attorney.</p>

<p>Comes now Adam Beeler, <add>of the firm of Beeler &amp; Sullivan,</add> as attorney for and in
behalf of Chin Quock Wah, an alien, a subject of the Emperor of
China, and a son of CHIN WE HUE, a Merchant of the City of 
Boston, State of Massachutes, and respectfully makes this
application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, and alleges as follows:</p>
<p>I.
That said Chin Quock Wah is imprisoned and restrained
of his liberty, by the United States Commissioner of Immigration,
Henry M. White, or by some person or persons acting
through, by or under him, and that said Chin Quock Wah, is 
imprisoned at the Detention House at the Immigration Station
in the City of Seattle, King County, State of Washington, and
within the jurisdiction of the above entitled Court, under teh 
charge that the said Chin Quock Wah, was found, and still is,
unlawfully in the United States, and that he should be deported
according to law, and your petitioner further informs the
Honorable Court that said imprisonment, confinement andrestraint
and Order of Deportation is illegal and arises from the following
facts, to-wit: That the said Ching Quock Wah, was tried
in the City of Boston, State of Massachutes, and in the United 
S tates, and found not entitled to remain in the United States, 
and that thereafter the said Chin Quock Wah gave notice of appeal
and an appeal was taken from the Commissioner before whom he was
tried, in the City of Boston, State of Massachutes, to the 
<fw>-1-</fw>
<pb/>
Secretary of Labor, and the said Order of Deportation, and the
said finding of the Commissioner of Immigration at said City
of Boston, State of Massachusetts, was affirmed, and the said
Chin Quock Wah, ordered deported.</p>
<p>Your petitioner is informed and believes and so states
the fact to be that said Commissioner of Immigration, Henry 
M. White, of Seattle, King County, in charge of the District 
of Washington, or his agent or agents, official or officials,
acting by, under or through him, or for the United States
Government, is about to deport and return the said Chin Quock
Wah to China, in violation of the treaty relations between 
the United S tates and China, and in violation of the laws and 
statutes of the United States relation to teh acts and 
powers of the Secretary of Labor and the Assistant Secretary of 
Labor, in that said Chin Quock Wah is being deprived of his 
liberty without due process of law and without being given a fiar
hearing by said Commissioner of Immigration, Henry M. White, 
or his agents or officials actions by and under or through him, 
or for the United States Government.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further alleges that the right of appeal
from said Finding of Commissioner of Immigration, Henry M. White,
or his agents or officials acting by, under or through him, or 
for the United States Government in and for the District of 
Washington, by the statutes in such cases made and provided for in 
relation to the Chinese Exclusion Laws, has been violated and 
that his full rights have not been accorded to your Petitioner
Chin Quock Wah in this: that W. B. Wilson is the Secretary of 
and that Louis Post is his only Assistant Secretary of Labor;
Labor <del>;</del> that both of said officials, as your petitioner alleges
upon information and belief, and believes the fact to be, were
at their respective offices in the capitol at Washington, doing
the duties imposed upon them on the day that the said appeal
of Chin Quock Wah was considered, and that upon said day and at
said time that the appeal of the said Chin Quock Wah, to the
<fw>-2-</fw>
<pb/>
Secretary of Labor, from the decision denying the right to
remain in the United S tates of Chin Quock Wah, came up for
hearing and consideration, that said Secretary of Labor and the
Assistant Secretary of Labor were then and there present in
their respective offices, and that the said Secretary of Labor 
or Assistant Secretary of Labor, under the statutes, should 
have considered and determined the said appeal of Chin Quock
Qah from the said adverse decision of the said Commissioner of 
Immigration, but that said Secretary of Labor and Assistant
Secretary of Labor failed, neglected or refused so todo, and
hence the said Chin Quock Wah has been denied his right of
appeal, according to law.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner further alleges that one J. B. Densmore
is the Solicitor of the Department of Labor, and further alleges
that said J. B. Densmore attempted to perform the duties of the
Secretary of Labor or Assistant Secretary of Labor while they
were present in their respective offices, and the order of the 
President of the United States, with due respect thereto, does
not authorize said J. B. Denmore, or such Solicitor of the
Department of Labor to perform the duties of the Secretary of
Labor or the Assistant Secretary of Labor, save and except in
their absence, and therefore the action of said J. B. Denmore
in claiming to be the acting Secretary of Labor during the 
presence of said officials then and there, is a usurption of the
duties imposed upon the said Secretary of the Department of 
Labor and the said Assistant Secretary of Labor, by Congress,
and the said J. B. Densmore, in assuming the duties of the 
said Secretary of Labor and the Assistant Secretary of Labor
and affirming the Finding of the Commissioner of Immigration
at Boston Massachusetts, in relation to the ease of Chin Quock
Wah, exceeded the statute, and his action in sustaining the 
adverse decision in relation to the right to remain of Chin
Quock Wah in the United States, is null and the said Chin Quock
Wah has been denied the right of appeal as provided by the 
<fw>-3-</fw>
<pb/>
statutes in such cases.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner on information and belief, further
states that the said Chin Quock Qah, has not had a fair and
impartial trial before the said Commissioner of Immigration at
Boston, Massachusetts; that there is no evidence in the records 
to sustain the Department's Exclusion and Deporation had
illegally ordered his exclusion from entry to the United States
and his deportation therefrom without any authority or law, 
to-wit, by the illegal act of said Solicitor J. B. Densmore, who 
had no authority to order said deportation, was denied a fair
and impartial trial in accordance with law, and that said Chin
Quock Wah was denied the right of having his counsel, appear
before the Commissioner of Immigration, or the lawful
acting Secretary of Labor after said Chin Quok Wah, had appealed
from the said illegal act of said Solicitor J.  B. Densmore
and after said appeal had reached the Department of Labor, in 
order that said counsel might present the case to the said
Commissioner General of Immigration, or the lawfully acting
Secretary of Labor, and bring to the attention of said officials
the said illegal act of said Solicitor J. B. Densmore, and place
certain evidence before said officials which would warrant a 
reversal of said order of exclusion and deportation, or would
warrant their consideration of the appeal of the said Ching Quock 
Wah.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, your Petitioner prays that this Court find
that the said Ching Quock Qah has not been accorded to the rights
and privileges allowed by the Constitution of the United States, 
and by the treaty between the United States and China, and that
he be discharged and allowed to join his father who is a merchant
in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
