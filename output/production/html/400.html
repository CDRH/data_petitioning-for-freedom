    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On November 22nd, 1923, Harry Miller filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He claimed that he was being unlawfully detained by Peter Dillon, Charles VanDeusen, Ike Walton, and a John Doe. He said the reason for his detainment was a warrant issued by the governor of Nebraska based off of a requisition by the governor of Missouri. In this warrant, Ike Walton (Kansas City Chief of Police) and the other named respondents were authorized to detain Harry and bring him to the state border to be transported back to Kansas City, where he was alleged to have attempted to acquire property under false pretenses. Harry claimed that this detainment was unlawful for many reasons: 1) All proceedings had and papers issued regarding the requisitions and warrant were null and void 2) The governor of Nebraska had no power to authorize his detainment because the demand and requisition was not authorized by the Constitution or Nebraska or Missouri statute 3) The warrant was issued with no investigation 4) He had never been in Missouri to commit the crimes he was accused of 5) Extradition was not authorized by the Constitution or Nebraska statute 6) The crimes alleged against him were crimes of Missouri and not Nebraska. The respondents submitted a return in which they claimed their authority for detainment came from a warrant issued out of the Municipal Court of Omaha by Judge George Holmes. Neither the governor of Nebraska or Missouri were mentioned in this return. But, the warrant was for the charge of being a fugitive from justice. On November 26th, Judge Arthur Wakely ruled in favor of Harry; he allowed the writ and Harry was released from custody.</li>
