District Court.&#8212;The term of Court for Seattle, in the Third District, will convene on Monday next, the 7th inst. There are several important cases, which, together with many minor ones, will likely occupy considerable time. Judge B. G. Dennison will likely preside, as the commission of Judge O. Jacobs will hardly have time to reach him at that time.
