<p>Exhibit C</p> 
<p>STATE OF WASHINGTON
COUNTY OF SPOKANE ))) SS.</p>
<p>JOSEPH PLASTINO, Being first duly sworn, on
oath says: He is, and for more than twenty-five years last past has
been, a resident of the city of Spokane, Washington; that he is forty-
six years of age, is the owner and proprietor of the Plastino Hotel in
said city of Spokane; that he is a brother of Sam Plastino, against whom
an order and warrant of deportation was issued on March 13, 1912, by
Daniel J. Keefe, Commissioner General, Department of Commerce and Labor,
Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization; that at all times on and after
and prior to the 7th day of February, 1912, the relations between the
said Sam Plastino and affiant were of a cordial and brotherly nature and
character: that while affiant was sorely grieved and distressed over the
prosecution and conviction of the said Sam Plastino in the case of the
United states of America vs. Sam Plastino, affiant at no time suffered
any change in his brotherly feelings toward the said Sam Plastino, and
never withdrew from him such advice, aid, and comfort as were within his
power to give; that affiant has read the propounded transcript of testi-
money said to have been given by affiant at Spokane, Washington, on
February 7, 1912, in the matter of the arrest of Sam Plastino before
Thomas M. Fisher, Examining Inspector; that the said Thomas M. Fisher
did not then and there, or at any time or place, propound to affiant the
following questions, or any questions of similar nature or import:</p> 
<p>Q. BY INSPECTOR FISHER.
(To Joe Plastino, brother of Sam Plastino)</p> 
<p>"Your brother, Sam Plastino, has been given a hearing to show his
right to be, or remain, in the United States. He states that he wanted
an attorney to represent him, provided you will furnish the same?"</p>
<p>That affiant did not then, or at any time, give the following
answer, or any answer of similar nature or import:</p> 
<p>A. (BY JOE PLASTINO).</p> 
<p>"I am through with him for good; I will have nothing to do with
hiring an attorney for him."</p> 
<p>That the said T. M. Fisher did not inform affiant that deporta-
tion proceedings were pending against the said Sam Plastino; that the
subject of the employment of counsel for the said Sam Plastino in said
matter, or in any matter or proceeding of any kind and character, was
not then, or at any other time, mentioned to affiant in any form by the
said T. M. Fisher; that said pretended answer did not represent the at-
titude or feeling of affiant toward said Sam Plastino; that had affiant
been informed that the said Sam Plastino requested, required, or de-
sired an attorney to represent him in said matter, he would have procured
counsel for that purpose.</p>
<p>That the only questions propounded to affiant by said T. M.
Fisher, or any other person, in connection with said matter, related to
the residence and citizenship of the said Sam Plastino and Michele Plas-
tino, his father.</p> 
<p>Joseph Plastino
SUBSCRIBED AND SWORN TO Before me this 28th day of July, 1916.</p> 
<p>LeRoy B. Hay
Notary Public for the state of
Washington, residing at Spokane,
Washington.</p>
