    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Frank Brandt petitioned on behalf of his 14 year old daughter for custody. Frank was married to Emma Brandt and they had a daughter, Pearl in 1891. Three years later, Emma passed away. In 1897, Frank remarried Martha Dorhmann. In 1904 Frank's sister, Emma Becker, solicited the custody of Pearl for the purpose of assisting her in and about her household duties, alleging that her mother was ill and she could not do it all herself. Frank permitted Pearl to go with Emma until he sent for her to come back. Frank filed the writ because he demanded Pearl back three months later and Emma refused. Emma argued against this accusation and said that she was in the process of getting custody of Pearl because Frank and Martha were unfit to take care of Pearl themselves. The court ended up giving custody back to Frank and Martha after Emma did not appear for the hearings. </li>
