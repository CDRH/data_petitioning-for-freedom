<p>IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT FOR, THE NINTH CIRCUIT, FOR THE DISTRICT
OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>In the Matter of Jerome C. Corbin,
For the Writ of Habeas Corpus of
Frank E. Corbin, a minor.
</p>
<p>To the Honorable C. H. Hanford, Judge of the United States Circuit 
Court for the District of Washington, Northern Division,.</p>
<p>The petition of Jerome E. Corbin respectfully shows:-</p>
<p>1st. That he is the father of Frank E. Corbin, a minor, who was
born on the second day of July, 1884 in the State of Michigan, and was
at all the times hereinafter mentioned, and is now under the age of 21
years, to-wit:- of the age of 19 years and 4 months old, and that your
petitioner has never emancipated said son, and is now entitled to his
custody, control, assistance and support.</p>
<p>2nd. That said Frank E. Corbin wrongfully and unlawfully and without
the knowledge or consent of your petitioner enlisted as a soldier in the
United States Army at Seattle, Washington, on November 30, 1903, and was
sent to Co. B, 19th Infantru at Vancouver Barracks, Vancouver, Washington,
about December 1st, 1903, and was (from said Co. B. transferred to Co. D.
19th Infantry, United States Army, stationed at Vancouver, Washington,
where he is now wrongfully and unlawfully detained from your petitioner
and your petitioner deprived of his assistance, his support and of his
custody and control. </p>
<p>3rd. That said minor enlisted in said military service of the
United States on the 30th day of November, 1903, being then and there
between the age of 18 and 21 yearsm and wrongfully represented to the
recruiting officers at Seattle, Washington, that he was of the age of 21
years and 4 months, which was in fact untrue.</p>
<p>4th.That your petitioner had no knowledge of said mis-representation
on the part of said minor to said recruiting officers and that your
minor desired petitioner to give his consent to said minor's enlistment
in the United States Army. That your petitioner then and there at the
time absolutely declined and refused to consent to said enlistment and
and refused to permit said minor, Frank E. Corbin, to enlist in the
United States Army, because of his tender age, and because of the
physical condition of your petitioner he was unable to spare him
as a means of his assistance and support. That said Frank E. Corbin
is a boy of extreme youthful appearance, though tall in 
statute, in so much that the recruiting officer, Sergeant Louis
H. Mohr, sent a letter by him on November 9, 1903, requesting
petitioner to certify as to said minor's age, which petitioner has
at all times declined and refused to do.</p>
<p>5th. That your p etitioner demanded the discharge and release of
said minor, Frank E. Corbin, from the Army, of the Secretary of War,
the Hon. Elihu Root, in accordance with the regulations of the
United States Army and Articles of War, as well as the Acts of
Congress relating to the Military Service of the United States, on
December 22, 1903, before said minor, Frank E. Corbin, was entitled to
any pay or allowance, and before he had yet receoved any pay of
allowance or compensation on account of his enlistment as such
soldier, and your petitioner further offered to bear the expense
of his transportation from Vancouver Barracks, Vancouver, Washington,
to Tacoma, Washington, and at the same time duly served upon the
Captain of the Co. D. 19th Infantry, U.S.V. at Vancouver, Barracks,
Vancouver, Washington, a copy of said application to the Secretary
of War, and requested the discharge of said minor, and duly gave
notice of the illegality of said minor's enlistment, and duly
asserted then and there his rights to the custody and control of
said minor,Frank E. Corbim. </p>
<p>6th. That said Secretary of War, through Assistant Adjudant
General refused and declined to comply with the demand of your
petitioner, and that your petitioner has no other adequate and
speedy remedy whereby he can recover or obtain control and
custody of his said minor child.</p>
<p>7th. That said Frank E. Corbin had not in anyway been adjuged
or condemned by any Court Marshall or other Military or Legal
Tribunal, and is unlawfully imprisoned and detained, confined and
restrained of his liberty by the Captain of Co. D., 19th Infantry
at Vancouver Barracks, Vancouver, Washington, under command of
Captain A. S. Rowan in the County of Clarke, and State of 
Washington.</p>
<p>8th. That the said imprisonment, detention, confinement and restraint
are illegally, and that the illegality thereof consists in said
Military authorities restraining and holding said Frank E. Corbin
as a duly and legally enlisted soldier in the service of the
United States Army, he neing then and there between the age of
19 and 20 years, without the consent of petitioner, his father and
natural guardian, W he is by law entitled to his care, custody and
control under and by virtue and maintenance of the United States
Army and rules and regulations made and promulgated in pursuance 
thereof.</p>

may be granted directed to said A. S. Rowan, Commander of Co. D.
