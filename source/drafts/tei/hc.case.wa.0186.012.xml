<p>In the District Court of the United States for the Western
District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application
of
Antonio Bisegna, alias Disegna,
for Writ of Habeas Corpus } No. 2679
Petition for Writ of
Habeas Corpus.</p>
<p>To the Honorable Jeremiah Neterer, Judge of the United
States District Court of the Western District of Washington,
Northern Division:</p>
<p>The petition of Antonio Bisegna respectfully represents
and shows to this honorable court as follows:</p>
<p>I. That your petitioner is unjustly and unlawfully detained
and imprisoned in the King County jail in the City of Seattle
in said County, State of Washington, by the United States Commissioner
of Immigration.</p>
<p>II.
That your petitioner is a white person, born in the Province 
of Aquila, Northern Italy, and left his native country of
his own free will and not by any reason of having committed any
offense against the laws of said country, and lawfully entered
the United States on Feburary 14, 1908, and has ever since made
this country his place of residence; that on April 17, 1910, he
left certain of his personal affects in said City of Seattle and
temporarily went to British Columbia, Deominion of Canda, where
he remained until October 22, 1913, when he returned to said
City of Seattle.</p>
<p>III.
Your petitioner further shows that he is of sound mind, in
good health, ablebodied and able to take care of himself, and
has ever had sufficient funds to meet all the requirements of
<pb/>
the laws of the United States, and did not enter the United
States as a contract laborer.</p>
<p>IV.
Your petitioner further shows that he has not been
been convicted of or admitted having committed a felony
or other crime involving moral turpitude, and that he
is not held by said Immigration Commssioner upon any final
process issued by a Court of common jurisdiction or
held upon any process or order for any contempt of any
Court, officer or body hving authority to commit or hold 
him, nor upon any warrant issued by any court of this
State upon indictment or infomration in this State, nor 
is there any lawful or valid reason for the detention of
your petitioner.</p>
<p>V.
That your petitioner is held by the said Commissioner
of Immigration upon the alleged ground that he was a person
likely to become a public charge at the time of his
entry into the United States as shown by a copy of the
warrant of arrest hereto annexed, but your petitioner avers
that the time and place of entry into the United States is
not as set forth in said warrant, but as hereinbefore set
forth, and that he was at the time of entry and now is
able to secure and save harmless the United States from
any damage of any kind and nature whatsoever arising from
<fw>(2)</fw>
<pb/>
inability of your petitioner to support and take care of
himself, and that he is amply able and willing and intends
to be a good and selfsupporting resident of the United 
States.</p>
<p>VI
Your petitioner further represents that he was not
given a fair and impartial hearing, as is contemplated by
law; that the Immigration officials and inspectors were
biased and prejudiced and are attempting to do indirectly
what they could not do directly, in that your petitioner
believes that the evidence upon which said officials bases
their charge was the commission of an assual on the third
degree, as defined by the statute of the State of Washington,
a misdemeanor not involving moral turpitude, by this
petitioner after his entry into the United States and for
which your petitioner was not responsible; that the special 
examining board and Secretary of Labor and said Commissioner
exceeded their authority and jurisdiction and acted in an
arbitrary manner and that there is no evidence to bring
this petitioner within the excluded classes at the time of
his entry, but all of the evidence is to the contrary and
shows that your petitioner had entered the United States
more than three years prior to the issuance of the warrant
of arrest herein, which warrant was issued contrary to and
without any foundation in law, and that your petitioner is
not amendable to the law which is the basis for the issuance
of said warrant.</p>
<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays:</p>
<p>1. That a Writ of Habeas Corpus issue out of this Court directed
to Henry M. White, the said Commissioner of Immigration,
in whose custody your petitioner now is, commanding and requiring
said Commissioner to have the body of your petitioner before
this Court on some special and convenient day to be determined
<fw>(3)</fw>
<pb/>
by this court, and then and there to show cause why this petitioner
is detained of his liberty, and why he should not be 
forthwith and immediatel discharged from said custody.</p>
<p>II. 
That the pending of the return of this Writ at the date so
to be fixed by this court to assure his appearance at the said
return day.</p>
<p>III.
That your petitioner be discharged from said custody and
that he have such other and further relief as this court may 
deem just.</p>
