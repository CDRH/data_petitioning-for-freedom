      <p class="tei_p">State of Missouri 
County of St Louis } ss</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hugh Logne personally 
appeared before me Peter W Johnstone a Justice 
of the Peace in and for said County, and being 
duly sworn says that on the night of 
the 24th May 1853 he arrested as a run-away slave a negro man calling his name 
George Turney - and further says he 
has good reason to believe the said 
George is a Runaway slave, and 
prays the Justice may commit said 
George for safe keeping</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hugh Logne</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sworn and subscribed before 
me this 25th day of May 1853</p>
