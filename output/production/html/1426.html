    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Petitioner, Rosie Wise, was arrested by the Omaha Police Department on 25 July 1912. Immediately thereafter, the Douglas County Attorney filed a complaint against Wise alleging that she had committed assault with intent to commit great bodily harm on Mary Mott. The petition stated that she was refused a preliminary hearing. Wise was granted a thirty day continuance to secure a bail bond, she was unable to secure bail in that time. During that period, she was continuously denied a preliminary hearing. She was granted a second thirdy day continuance where she still failed to secure bail and was again refused a preliminary hearing. Wise submitted this petition stating that she was being kept against her will, &#x201C;with complete want of authority and without process of law.&#x201D; On 24 September 1912, Judge A. L. Sutton ordered that the writ be allowed, returnable on 26 September 1912. On 28 September 1912, Judge Sutton ordered that the writ be denied and the petition dismissed. </li>
