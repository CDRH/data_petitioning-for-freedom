    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On July 22, Morris Passovoy filed for Habeas. He charged, in his petition, that his imprisonment was infringing on his constitutional rights as a citizen, that O. Gorman holds a false warrant for his arrest - claiming him as a fugitive from justice from Wisconsin. Passovoy also claimed innocence from charges of embezzlement or other crime in the false warrant. He also explained that he has lived in Omaha for three years, has never concealed membership in the unnamed organization, and that the charge against him is past the statute of limitations in both Nebraska and Wisconsin. He also charged that the complaint against him was made in bad faith and has paid all alleged debts. A writ of habeas was issued but was dismissed on motion of the applicant on July 25.</li>
