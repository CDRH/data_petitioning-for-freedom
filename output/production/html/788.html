    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Robert H. Robinson came to the court alleging that his six year old child, George G. P. Robinson, was deprived of his liberty by Mrs. William Kruse. After the death of the child's mother in 1890, Robert had employed Mrs. Kruse to care for George, as he traveled frequently in his job as a Pullman porter. While he never visited, he sent $2.50 a week for the child's care. He had asked for custody of the boy back as he had recently remarried&#x2014;to a white woman, as the Evening World-Herald points out. George was also described as a "mulatto" in an Evening World-Herald article. Mrs. Kruse maintained that he owed her $200 for the child, and traveled from Council Bluffs to Omaha to try to avoid him. The writ was allowed and ultimately the child was ordered to be returned to his father, although the Evening World-Herald claims that he cried for Mrs. Kruse, who he saw as his mother, while exiting the courtroom.</li>
