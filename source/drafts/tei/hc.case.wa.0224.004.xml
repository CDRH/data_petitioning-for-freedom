called as witness, as being first
sworn, testified as follows:</p> 
<p>QUESTIONS by MR KENNEDY:</p> 
<p>1 Q. What is your occupation, Mr Pritchard? A. Wel I have
not been doing anything for about three years. I ran a store
at Ollala, in a mining camp at Ollala B.C. That was the last
business I was in.</p> 
<p>2 Q. When did you come to Vancouver last? A. I think about the
13th of February I came here. That would be about four months
ago.</p> 
<p>3 Q. Now on the 4th of June, Mr Pritchard, will you tell us in
your own words what occurred in connection with this charge?
A. Well I had a deal on for some land, and I went to the Bank
and withdrew eighteen hundred dollars from the Canadian Bank of
Commerce, Hastings Street; and my lawyer went over to West-
minster to search the title for me that day, and I was waiting
for him to come back, and he didn't get back till about 5:30</p>
<p>4 Q. We can shorten that a great deal. You had the eighteen
hundred dollars in your pocket at what time of night? A. Well
I had it when I was up
<pb></pb>
in the lawyer's office. That would 
be about six o'clock.</p> 
<p>5 Q. Well what next? A. My lawyer and -r Shayer- that is the
party I am buying the land from - we left the office and
alked over to the Commercial Hotel and had a drink; and my
lawyer, Mr. McGill he went away home, and we walked down as 
far as the Woods Hotel and got another drink; and that is the
last I recollect.</p> 
<p>6 Q. Who were with you when you had the drink at the Woods
Hotel? A. Mr. Shayer</p> 
<p>7 Q. And anybodyelse? A.No.</p> 
<p>8 Q. And when you had a drink at the first Hotel? A. That was
just after we left the office.</p> 
<p>9 Q. Who was with you then? A. Mr. McGill, my lawyer, and Mr Shay
er and myself.</p> 
<p>10 Q. Are you a drinking man? A. Yes I have been drinking all my
life, but not much.</p> 
<p>11 Q. Have you ever had it happen recently that two drinks would
put you clean out A. No</p> 
<p>12 Q. What were you drinking? A. Seagrams Rye whiskey</p>
<p>13 Q. And that is the last you recollect till when? A. Till
next morning at seven o'clock</p> 
<p>14 Q. Where did you find yourself then? A. In the Hotel Main
lying on the bed with my clothes on.</p> 
<p>15 Q. Where is that with reference to the Woods Hotel? A. Why
the Woods is on Hastings street and the Main is on. . . .</p> 
<p>16 Q. How far away, how many blocks? A. About four blocks, five
blocks, I guess</p> 
<p>17 Q. Were you staying up at the Main Hotel at all? A. Yes I have
been staying there all along since I have been in town.</p> 
<p>18 Q. Did you find yourself in your own room then? A. Yes</p> 
<p>19 Q. What about the money? A. When I woke up, the first thing I 
thought of was the money when I found what shape I was in
lying on the bed, and I found it was gone.</p> 
<p>20 Q. Were you dressed? A. I was lying on the bed with my
<pb></pb>
clothes on.</p> 
<p>21 Q. When was the last time you that you remeber, that you saw you 
had the money? A. I don't know. I don't recollect
any particular time that I had it.</p> 
<p>22 Q. You say you had it when you were at the lawyer's office
A. Yes and I am sure I had it when I was at the Woods. I am 
confident I had it at the Woods, although I don't recollect
putting my hand on it.</p> 
<p>23 Q. How were you carrying it? A. In a pocket-book in my left 
hand hip pocket?</p> 
<p>24 Q. Had you shown the money to anybody at either of the Hotels
that you recollect? A. No not at that time.</p> 
<p>25 Q. Do you remember seeing at either Hotel any colored man
A. No I don't</p> 
<p>26 Q. What was the denominations of the money? A. There were
seventeen hundred dollar bills and two fifties that I took out
of the Bank, and then I'had some ten dollar bills in my pocket
-- I think about ninety dollars in ten dollar bills in my 
pocket-book.</p> 
<p>27 Q. In the same book? A.Yes in the same pocket-book, in the same
pocket</p> 
<p>28 Q. And the whole pocket-book was gone, A. Yes</p> 
<p>29 Q. In all you lost how much? A. I think $180</p>
<p>30 Q. $180? A. $1880, I should say because I had change for a
ten dollar bill in my pocket the next morning, and I think 
I must have changed a ten dollar bill some place. So I 
think I may say $1880.</p>
<p>31 Q. In the vicinity anyway? A. Yes</p> 
<p>32 Q. I asked you a moment ago whether you are a drinking man;
are you man who is in the habit of getting drunk? A. No
not in the habit; once in a while I get off but I don't make
a practice of it.</p> 
<p>33 Q. Have you been on any spree recently> A. No.</p> 
<p>34 Q. Had you gone out with the intention of a spree on this
occasion at all? A. No certainly not.</p> 
<p>35 Q. You say "certainly not" because you had so much money with
you? A. Yes</p>
