<p>In the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Northern Divison.</p>

<p>No. 5630.</p>

<p>Decision.</p>

<p>Filed Dec.<gap></gap>, 1920.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Chung Him and Seid Yam for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>John L. Corrigan, Attorney for Petitioner.</p>

<p>NETERER, District Judge,</p>

<p>The petitioners Seid Yam and Chung Him, subjects of China, 59 and 65 years of age respectively, have each lived in the United States forty years, and made one brief visit to China many years ago. After summary hearing and appeal they were ordered deported by the Secretary of Labor for being in the United States in violation of the Act of February 5, 1917, to wit: "That he has been found employed by, in or in connection with a house of prostitution." The charge against each is identical. Each says he has been denied a fair hearing. Each petitioner says he was employed, one two and a half months, and the other five weeks, in a certain house in Ketchikan, Alaska; that he is a cook by occupation; "That if said house was in fact a house of prostitution, that fact was not nown to either of your petitioners, that neither of your petitioners came in contact with any immoral persons, and had no knowledge whatsoever that said place was a house of prostitution, if such was indeed the fact." It is contended by the petitioners, among other things, that they are not amenable to the Act, supra; that having lived in the United States many years they were entitled to have the right to remain judicially determined, and are not subject to executive action and decision.</p>

<p>I think the issue in this case is decided in U.S. vs. Woo Jan, 245 U.S. 552. The Supreme Court in White vs. Chin Fong, decided May 17, 1920, in discussing the relation between a Chinese in the United States and one seeking to enter said:</p>

<pb/>

<p>"IN U.S. vs. Woo Jan ***** we had occasion to consider the difference between the situation of a Chinese person in the United States and one seeking to enter it; and held that the former was entitled to a judicial inquiry and determination of his rights, and that the latter was subject to executive action and decision."</p>

<p>Section 13 of the Act of September 13, 1888, an act to prohibit the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States, provides:</p>

<p>"That any Chinese person or person of Chinese descent found unlawfully in the United States or its territories may be arrested upon a warrant issued upon a complaint under oath filed by any party on behalf of the United States, by any justice of any United States Court returnable to any justice, judge or commissioner of any United States, or to any United States Court, and when convincted upon a hearing and found and adjudged to be one not lawfully entitled to be or remain in the United States, such person shall be removed by the United States to the country from whence he came, but any such Chinese person convicted before a Commissioner of the United States Court, may within ten days from such conviction appeal to the Judge of the District Court for the District."</p>

<p>Sec. 3 of the Act of March 3, 1901, 31, <add>Stat. 1093</add> provides that a warrant for arrest of violation of the Chinese Exclusion Act shall not be issued except upon the sworn complaint of certain enumerated officers of the United States, unless approval or requested in writing by the United States Attorney of the District in which it is issued.</p>

<p>By the Act of April 29, 1902, as amended and reenacted April 27, 1902, 32, Stat. Pt. 1-176, 33 Stat. 394:</p>

<p>"All laws****regulating, suspending, or prohibiting the coming of Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent into the United States****are****reenacted, extended and continued without modification, limitation or condition."</p>

<p>U.S. vs. Woo Jan, supra, and White vs. Chin Fong, supra, decide every conention in this case.</p>

<p>The writ is granted.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Neterer</p>
<p>Judge.</p>
