<p>United States District Court
Western District of Washington
Northern Division</p>
<p>In the Matter of The Application
of Marie Miler for a Writ of
Habeas Corpus. } No. 2457
Brief.</p>
<p>The first question to be determined is the legal right
of an alien in regard to deportation. Under the 5th
amendment to the Constitution, an alien, being a "person"
shall not be "deprived of life, liberty or property without
due process of law". The Act of Feburary 20, 1907; Sections
20 and 21, as amended by the Act of March 26, 1910, provides
in effect that an alien may be deported when the Commissioner
of Commerce and Labor (now the Commissioner of Labor) is
satisfied that the alien has been practicing prostitution.
Section 22 provides for the enforcement and the promulgation
of rules not inconsistent with the law, which should be laid
down by the Commissioner-General of Immigration. The rules
as shown by the amended return provide:</p>
<p>"During the course of the hearing the alien shall be
allowed to inspect the warrant of arrest and all the
evidence on which it was issued; and at such stage
thereof as the officer before whom the hearing is
held shall deem proper, he shall be apprised that
he may thereafter be represented by counsel and shall
be required then and there to state whether he desires
counsel or waives the same and his reply shall be
entered on the record. If counsel be selected, he 
shall be permitted to be present during the further
conduct of the hearing, to inspect and make a copy
of the minutes of the hearing, so far as it has
<pb/>
proceeded, and to offer evidence to meet any evidence
theretofore or thereafter presented by the Government.
Objections and expceptions of counsel shall
not be entered on the record, but mauy be dealt with
in an accompanying brief."</p>
