    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On May 21st, 1921, Hans A. Hulke was arrested in the City of Omaha to be held until his extradition to the state of Indiana. Initially, Hulke and his counsel were unaware of his extradition; however, on May 25th, during his hearing for his petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus, the petitioner was made aware of this fact. Following this revelation, Hulke filed a motion for continuance to better prepare his case for freedom. The judge granted the motion and scheduled the return for June 4th, 1921. During this time, the respondents obtained an order from the Governor of Nebraska to arrest Hulke and hold him to be extradited to Indiana. The court was informed that Hulke had committed grand larceny in Indiana against the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, which sought to press charges against Hulke. Despite this, because he was arrested with no warrant or mittimus, the judge ruled in favor of Hulke and deemed that his detainment was illegal and that he would be set free immediately. </li>
