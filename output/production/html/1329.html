    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Edward Gibbons claimed to have been unlawfully detained by Felix J. McShane and Henry Schroeder. The witnesses called in to testify for the case described Gibbons as attempting to steal a car and then running away, yet none of the witnesses saw Gibbon's face. Through witness testimony, people explain that Gibbons was not at the scene of the crime and was at work during the time and then was arrested at work.  Edward was accused of grand larceny and was eventually released from custody because of insufficient evidence of his guilt.</li>
