    <li>Summary of Proceedings: According to the appearance docket, A. E. Howard, attorney for Kramer and Standish (whose first names are unknown), petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus against Henry V. Hoagland in 1902. An unknown judge granted the petition, and Hoagland was served. Two years later in 1904, the court dismissed the cause for want of action by the prosecution. The petition type is unknown but assumed carceral due to Hoagland's career in law enforcement. The fate of the bound party is unknown. </li>
