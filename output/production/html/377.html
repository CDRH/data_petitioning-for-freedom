    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Charles and Sarah Holton filed for a writ of Habeas Corpus to have custody of their children removed from Nebraska Children's Home Society and returned to them. Nebraska Children's home stated that the Holtons were an immoral influence on their children and that the children's current placement is in their best interest. The petition was denied, and the children stayed in the custody of the Nebraska Children's Home. A motion for a new trial was filed and, subsequently, overruled, and the action was dismissed at cost of Holton's. </li>
