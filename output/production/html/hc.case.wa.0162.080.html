      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington<br/>
County of Spokane} ss</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In the District
Court, Fourth Judicial District
holding terms at
Spokane Falls.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Territory of Washington<br/>
vs.<br/>
Ray Raymond</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I, S.C. Hyde, being duly 
sworn on my oath do
depose and say: That I 
have read the affidavit
of T.C. Griffitts, N. T. Caton
J. Kennedy Stout, Frederick
Stanford, and Ray Raymond, 
filed herein. That
the reason why T. Donaldson
and George Wycoff were not
called as witnesses to testify 
in this action before
the committing magistrates
and Grand Jury is because
this affiant has no knowledge 
that there were
any such persons, or
that they were present
at the killing of James
Finch, or had any information 

<span class="hr"> </span>

that they had
any knowledge concerning 
the same; and applicant
verily believes that none
of the grand jurors belonging 
to the grand jury
which found the indictment 
in this action had
any information thereof.
That affiant was first
informed that said T.
Donaldson and George
Wycoff had knowledge
of the facts and circumstances 
concerning the
killing of said James Finch
<del>on</del> after the finding of
the indictment herein.
That I thereupon, immediately 
upon receiving such
information caused subpoenas 
to issue for
their appearance before
our said court to testify 
in this action. That
I have never had any
communication whatever
with said witnesses or either
of them prior to their
appearance at this
time of court as witnesses 
in this action.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>


      <p class="tei_p">That none of defendants
counsel have ever inquired 
of me concerning
the testimony of said
witnesses or their knowledge 
of the facts, relating
to the killing of James
Finch. That if they or
either of them had done
so, affiant would have
given them such information 
as he possessed concerning 
the same, or would
have made such counsel
of defendant acquainted 
with said witnesses
and given them an opportunity 
to inquire of
said witnesses conerning 
the same. That
affiant is now ready
and willing to make defendants 
counsel acquainted 
with said witnesses
to the end that they
may <del>become</del> inquire
of said witnesses of their
knowledge of the facts
relating to the killing
of said Finch, to the
end that they may
become informed thereof.

<span class="hr"> </span>

Affiant further deposes and
says: That it is not true
that strong prejudice and
great excitement exists
against defendant in Spokane 
county and affiant
further avows that the
defendant can have a
fair just and impartial
trial at this term of court;
and in support of this
statement affiant submits
the affidavits heretofore
filed in this action by
the Territory, upon the
application of defendant
for a change of venue,
and makes said affidavits 
a part of this showing.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Affiant further saith
that he is acquainted with
Charles Wilson mentioned
in affidavit of Ray
Raymond, that he said
Wilson has been present
in Spokane Falls up to
the last three or four
days. That said Wilson
and said Ray Raymond
are, as affiant is informed
and verily believes, acquainted 

<span class="hr"> </span>

with said Ray 
Raymond, and that
he has often conversed
with her, and in all
probability has often conversed 
with her concerning 
the facts in this.
That said Charles Wilson
has up to within a short
time ago been a hack driver 
in this city.</p>
