    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On July 6, 1911, Mary A. Dohney placed an advertisement for a room for rent. On July 7, A. T. Cochran and alleged wife responded and co-habituated for five days in the rented room. The supposed wife was identified as Mary J. Carr, but Dohney had believed her to be called Mrs. Cochran. On July 11, Dohney launched a complaint against Carr, charging that she, a married woman, and A. T. Cochran, and single man, lived together in violation of section 11, chapter 38, revised statutes of the state of Illinois. Order of commitment and warrant against Carr was issued July 12, signed by clerk Galpin. On July 15, Carr was said to have departed from Chicago to Omaha, Nebraska. Warrant for Carr was sent to Omaha July 17, which provided a description and photograph of Carr. On July 19, Carr filed Habeas with attorney John G. Kuhn, against John J. Donohue. On July 19, the petition was granted, and a writ was issued; Carr was released on bond of $500 with Maurice Rouch as Surety. On July 26, the writ was sustained, and Carr was discharged. </li>
