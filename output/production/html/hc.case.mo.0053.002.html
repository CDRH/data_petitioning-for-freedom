      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable, the Judge of the Law 
Commissioner's Court within and for the 
County of Saint Louis</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner states that one 
Elihu Schooner a free citizen of the State 
of Ohio is imprisoned in the common jail 
of the County of Saint Louis by the keeper of 
said jail; that the said Schooner, under the 
name of Eli Schooner was committed to 
said jail on a charge of being a runaway 
slave, by virtue of a warrant issued by 
Peter W. Johnstone Esquire a Justice of the 
Peace in and for the said County of Saint Louis 
a copy of which said warrant is hereto annexed.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">And your petitioner further states 
that the said Schooner is not now and 
never has been a slave, but was born of 
free parents in Reed township Seneca 
County Ohio, about the year 1833 and 
that he has himself always been a free 
man and therefore his imprisonment is 
illegal</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Wherefore your petitioner prays that 
there may issue from this Honorable Court 
a writ of "Habeas Corpus" directed to the 
keeper of the said common jail of Saint

Louis County and commanding him to have 
the body of the said Schooner before this 
Honorable Court on a day therein to be 
mentioned, then and there to show the time 
and cause of the detention and imprisonment 
of the said Schooner, and to do and 
receive what shall then and there be 
considered concerning him.</p>
