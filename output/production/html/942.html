    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Moy Share Park, the bound party and an individual of Chinese descent, was charged under the Chinese Exclusion Act. This charge was appealed and subsequently denied on the 2nd of April 1920. On April 5, 1920, a writ of Habeas Corpus was filed alleging that his father was a Native Born U.S. Citizen and thus derived an exemption from the Act. On April 6th, 1920, Judge Cushman orders the holding party to respond to the application and explain why the writ should not be issued. On April 30th, 1920, Judge Neterer rules that the Chinese Exclusion Act stipulates that the decisions of immigration officials are final unless there was an unfair trial. By virtue of there being testimony present in the original appeal, the Neterer does not find this to be the case and finds that the court does not have jurisdiction to hear the writ. The writ was denied and the bound party was remanded to the custody of the Commissioner of Immigration.</li>
