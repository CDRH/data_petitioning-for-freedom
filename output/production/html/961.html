    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On May 29th, 1918, Lena Heaton was taken into custody under suspicion of prostitution. She was transported first to St. Joseph Hospital where she received initial inspections, and then to a building on 22nd &amp; St. Mary's Avenue where she was bound to prevent the spread of diseases that she was allegedly confirmed to have. The bound party, Heaton, alleged that she was not allowed to speak to anyone until her sister, Camille Schultz, was allowed to visit on July 13th, 1918. On July 20th, 1918, a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus was filed. A hearing was held in which the holding party, Health Commissioner Ernest C. Manning, filed a return and was subpoenaed to appear before the court. On July 23rd, 1918, the bound party's application was denied, which, based on the timeline, was interpreted to mean that the writ was denied. The costs of the officers involved in the case were taxed to the county whereas other costs were taxed to the bound party. On July 26th, 1918, the bound party filed for a new trial on the basis that the judgment was not sustained by sufficient evidence, the judgment was contrary to the evidence, errors of law were committed, the court erred in allowing testimony of physicians in relation to physical examinations, and that the court erred in allowing testimony of physicians in relation to conversations had with the bound party. The status of the appeal and fate of the bound party are unknown.</li>
