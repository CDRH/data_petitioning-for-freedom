<p>Territory of Washington
County of Spokane</p>

<p>be the matter of 
the application 
of George Woodard 
for a writ of Ha- 
beas corpus.</p>

<p>To the Honorable George 
Turner, Judge of the
district court of the of fourth
judicial court of 
Washington Territory:
    Your petitioner, George 
Woodard, respectfuly 
<unclear/></p>
    <p>That he is unlaw
-fully detained, confined,
and <unclear/> of his
liberty by James Glispins
Sheriff of Spokane County.
as the city of Spokane 
falls in Spokane County. 
    That the cause of 
unclear of constraint of
your petitioner accor-
ding to the best of
the knowledge and be-
lief of petitioner is that
said Glispins holds <unclear/>
your petitioner under and
by <unclear/> of <unclear 
extent="3 words"/> by one
J.R Yildea,a Justice
of the peace <unclear/> for
the precint of Spangle,
in the county of Spokane
<unclear/> which said
commitment is <unclear/>
issued by said Justice
of the Peace whom each
<unclear/> a charge made
before said Justice of the
Peace against his
petitioner for the crime 
of unlawfully selling
intoxicating liquor in
the precint of Spangle
in said Spokane County.</p>
  <p> That said detention
confinement,and impris-
onment of petitioner is 
illegal and that the
illegality-thereof consists
in this in wit:
       That the affidavit
and complaint under
which the charge on
which petitioner is unclear
held was prosecuted,
did not and does not
charge this petitioner
with the offense of un-
lawfully selling intox-
cating liquor, nor
with any other offense
whatever.</p>
   <p>That the evidence
offered against petitioner
was wholly insufficient
to show that there was
or is probable cause for
charging petitioner
for the crime of
unlawfully selling
intoxicating liquor or
any other offense
against the law what-
ever.</p>
  <p>That the pretended
commitment under
which petitioner is
held by said James
Glispins Sheriff is
void,for that it
appears whom the 
face thereof that 
said Justice of the
peace and <del/> his
power or authority of
issue said commit-
ment.</p>
 <p> That said Justice
of the peace required
petitioner to give bail
for his appearance
before the district
court to endeavour to
said pretended charge
of selling intoxicating
liquor unlawfully
in the time of <unclear
extent="3 words"/>
    That the said bail is
excessive, because
petitioner's unable
to give bail, in said
jail, and is able
and willing if <unclear/>
to give bail in the 
<unclear/> of two hundred
and fifty dollars.
that petitioner offered
said justice of the peace
good and sufficient
bail in the <unclear/> of
two hundred and
fifty dollars. that
said bail of five hun-
dred dollars in excess-
ive and appearing
to this officer, be-
cause it is out of
proportion to the of-
fense charged and 
is beyond the power
of petitioner to give.</p>

 <p> Therefore your 
petitioner <unclear/> that
a writ of Habeas Corpus
may be granted <unclear/>
<unclear/> to the <del/>
Jack James Glispins
Sheriff of Spokane County
commanding him to
the body of said

be specified, to do
and recieve what there
