      <p class="tei_p">Order Granting Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Upon reading the petition of Marie Miler, duly signed
and verified by her and filed in this Court, whereby it appears
that she is ellegally imprisioned and restrained of her liberty
by the Hon. Ellis DeBruller, United States Commissioner of Immigration,
at the Detention Station at Seattle, Washington, and
stating wherein the alleged illegality consists and wherein she
has not had an opportunity to be heard, and wherein the same is
in disregard of her rights as a citizen of the Empire of Austria,
and in furtherance of a conspiracy to deport her, brought about
by her enemies in an effort to deprive her of her financial
rights and property, from which it appears to me that a writ of
Habeas Corpus ought to issue, now therefore, it is</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Ordered that a writ of habeas corpus issue out of and
under the seal of the District Court of the United States for
the Western District of Washington, Northern Division, directed
to Ellis DeBruller, Commissioner as aforesaid, commanding him
to have the body of the said Marie Miler before me in the Court
room of the above entitled Court at Seattle, Washington, at the
Federal Court room in the Postoffice Building in the City of
Seattle, County of King, State of Washington, on the 21st day
of April 1913, at 1 o'clock, PM of that day,
to do and recieve what shall then and there be considered concerning
the said petitioner, Marie Miler, together with the
time and cause of her detention, and that you have then and
there the said writ.</p>
