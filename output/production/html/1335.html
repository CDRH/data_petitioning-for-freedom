    <li>Summary of Proceedings: A Native mother, Ah- lit- quah, allegedly signed an agreement with the Friends Mission School for Indians on Douglas Island that placed her 3 year old daughter, Nu- Shukk (Sarah Woodard) in the school. According to the document signed by a representative from the school and Ah- lit- quah, Nu-Shukk was also placed in the custody of Charles N. Replogle until she reach 18 years of age, or was discharged by Replogle for whatever reason. Ah- Lit- Quah took her daughter out of school shortly after enrollment and refused to return the child to the superintendent. Replogle filed a writ of habeas corpus for the child. The writ was granted and Judge Warren Truitt ordered Ah- lit- quah to bring Nu- Shukk to court. When she did not comply with the order, a warrant for her arrest was issued. Ah- lit- quah was arrested and Nu- Shukk was returned to the boarding school under the custody of Replogle. </li>
