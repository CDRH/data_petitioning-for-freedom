happy from his <unclear></unclear> He came 
in the front and opened my parlor

treat I'll drink I asked him to 
sit down and if you will treat 
first then I will, I was there alone 
and a little araid of him </p>

<p>He stepped past me to my dinning
room door and I turned round 
and said I don't want you to go 
in there, there is no one in "there 
he reached out and took me 
by the arm and said I will 
go in there I'll kick the belly 
off you I reached my hand 
up to him and took lead of 
the little cord <add>on his shirt</add> and said dont 
be cross lets be friends he 
said no I want my friend</p>

<p>I asked him who his friend 
was he said little fellow that 
came with him off the R.R. and 
described Johnny May bliss saying 
he had reason to believe he was 
there because he had asked for 
Miss Zorf and was told she

<pb/>

got a 33 and heard Johny as 
looking for her he said my little
Miss told me <add>I</add> asked him to stay 
that may be his friend would 
come said no he would go 
and hurt him he stood while 
he was there would not sit down 
was quite intoxicated and reeling
when he went out <del></del> managed
to get into the dinning room then 
out into the hall and not I followed 
him to the hall door and then locked 
it, Had no hat on </p>

<p> I was talking about a man 
dont know his name, never saw 
him before, nor sing, no I 
never heard his name dont 
presume to say he was the man 
did not see him after he was 
dead no one else heard this 
language I was alone I 
asked him to sit down done 
all I could to quiet him I asked 
him to treat to a glass beer 
yes I have beer there </p>

<p>Redirect</p>

gven by Dr. Morgan yesterday</p>

<p>Re Cros</p>

<p>I was here in the room while Dr
Morgan gave his testemant</p>

very near me I had to look up to 
see him leighth faded Moustache 
Drooped heavy at the Corners a little 
sunken in the cheeks heavy chin 
heavy forhead <del>looked</del> heavy over
his eyes hands rough working 
hands gad them on her face was
harsh <add>his</add> face clean and hair 
smooth Face smooth except 
Mustache looked as though 
had just cleand up upper clothing 
clean lower soiled smeared somewhat

<p>I did not see the man after 
he was dead <unclear>ans</unclear> describing the 
Man who Called at my house</p>

<p>Recross</p>

<p> Had rough weather beaten hand 
did not like them on my 
face had on Blue Overalls I 
dont presume to say he was the 
Man is what I said, He came 
there asking for his friend and 
Called him Johny and described 
Johny May bliss the reason I 
tought it was <unclear>Mayterss</unclear> was because 
he inquired for a little fellow 
that got acuainted with <unclear>Zorf</unclear>
at Coeur d'Alene I knew Johny 

<pb/> 
<!-- pages from second PDF -->
May bliss before, my front door 
<unclear>slams</unclear> open good deal in 
warm weather <add>at night</add> I know the 
Prisoner at the bar, <unclear></unclear> have 
not talked with me about my 
testimony have not set by her 
ever Counsler has ever me asked 
<del></del> if such a man visited my 
home</p>

<p>Redirect</p>

<p>Saw a torn peice of paper that looked 
like the one he had it in his hand 
I asked him to meet you perhaps
need your quarter to get somthing to 
eat he says no I've got 
money if I could get money &amp;
my papers I could buy your old 
house showed me a small square
piece of paper whch seemed to me
<unclear></unclear>that could file this, towrn ACross 
the Center folds Said a man 
worked hard in his country and got 
les <unclear>¢</unclear> on the dollar for his work</p>

<p>Recross</p> 

<p>No only by the size and appearance 
and only by its being torn dont pressure
to say it was the same man that was 
killed beacuse I did not see him </p>
