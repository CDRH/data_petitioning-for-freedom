<p>Q Have you any relatives in the United States? A No.</p>

<p>Q Do you own any property in this country? A No, I sold off everything.</p>

<p>Q Now have you anything to say as to why you should not be deported to Japan? A I would like to stay here; but I cannot help it if they send me back.</p>

<p>Q The bond in your case is $1,000; are you in a position to furnish that? A I have no money for bond.</p>

<p>Q Have you any friends who would put up bond for you? A I asked some friends but they said they cannot help.</p>

<p>Q Mr. Sharpe the marshal here, and all the city officials and federal officials, everybody knew you worked there? A Yes but they did not say nothing.</p>

<pb/>

<p>Q Nobody ever tell you not to work there? A No; nobody tell me.</p>

<p>Q Have you ever been arrested in this country? A Not one time.</p>
