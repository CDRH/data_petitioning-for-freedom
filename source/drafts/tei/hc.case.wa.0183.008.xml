Look was unable to have counsel present at the time she was examined

which provides:</p>
<p>"During the course of the hearings the alien shall be allowed
to inspect the warrant of arrest and all the evidence 
on which it was issued; and at such stage thereof
as the officer before whom the hearing is held shall
deem proper, he shall be apprised that he may thereafter
be represented by counsel and shall be required then and
there to state whether he desires counsel or waives the
same, and his reply shall be entered on the record. If
counsel be selected, he shall be permitted to be present
during the further conduct of the hearing, to inspect
and make a copy of minutes of the hearing, so far as
it has proceeded, and to offer evidence to meet any evidence
theretofore or thereafter presented by the government.
Objections and exceptions of counsel shall not be

brief."</p>
<p>That said Gwoo Shee Ah Look does not speak the English

<p>Your petitioner further shows that the second day after
the arrest of said Gwoo Shee Ah Look and before the said J.H. 
Barbour as such Inspector of Immigration had conducted his second

<figure><ab>Wilbur &amp; Spencer
Attorneys-At-Law
Portland Oregon</ab></figure>
<fw>-4-</fw>
<pb/>
of the said Gwoo Shee Ah Look; that at said time the said J.H.

conferred with the said A.L. Clark who requested of the said
J.H. Barbour permission to visit the said Gwoo Shee Ah Look,
who was then confined in the County Jail, and that at said time
the said Barbour was informed that said persons represented the
said Gwoo Shee Ah Look; that the said J.H. Barbour thereupon refused
counsel so requesting permission the right or privilege at
that time to see or consult with the said Gwoo Shee Ah Look; that
thereafter on several occasions and before the examination of said
Gwoo Shee Ah Look and other witnesses had been completed the said
A.L. Clark requested of said J.H. Barbour that he be notified
when said hearing was conducted and requested the privilege of being
present at such examination and cross-examination of the witnesses,
which request was regused and although having promised so to do the
said J.H. Barbour failed and neglected to notify the attorneys for
said Gwoo Shee Ah Look of the time and place of conducting such
examination; that thereafter after the said examination had been
made of the said Gwoo Shee Ah Loo by J.H. Barbour and the testimony
reduced to writing on the 19th day of November, 1913, the said J.H.
Barbour delivered a transcript of the testimony taken in said manner
to the attorneys of said Gwoo Shee Ah Look with the suggestion that
such evidence could then be presented by way of affidavit as was
deemed proper, and that there was no opportunity given or granted
to the said attorneys for Gwoo Shee Ah Look, who were known to be
the attorneys for the said Gwoo Shee Ah Look, to be present at any
of said examinations conducted to cross-examine any of the witnesses,
whose testimony was being taken; that thereafter the said

<pb/>
Shee Ah Look's deportation to China and found that the said alien
is a prostitute and has been found practicing prostitution subsequent
to her entry into the United States.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further alleges that the said order of deportation
and the said imprisionment and restraint of the liberty
of the said Gwoo Shee Ah Look is unlawful and illegal, in that
said Gwoo Shee Ah Look was not granted the rights and privileges 
insured to her in the manner in which the said hearings and testimony
were taken by the said J.H. Barbour, Inspector of Immigration,
because she was not granted the privilege of having her attorneys
present at such examination.</p>
<p>Yor petitioner further alleges that said restraint and order
of deportation are illegal in that there was no evidence before the 
Commissioner or Secretary of Commerce and Labor authorizing the 
order for said Gwoo Shee Ah Look's deportation. The only evidence
before either the Commissioner or the Secretary of Commerce and
Labor, save and except the statement of the said Gwoo Shee Ah Look
which the said parties had before then, was so far as the virtue of
Gwoo Shee Ah Look is concerned as follows:</p>
<p>"Q When and where did you first see this woman? (Gwoo Shee Ah Look)</p>
<p>"A About three weeks ago, about two weeks before her arrest was
made, upstairs, second floor, in a building on the southwest
corner of Fourth and Flanders Streets, this City.</p>
<p>"Q Under what circumstances did you see her at that time?</p>
<p>"A We were investigating that place, knowing that there were Chinese
prostitutes up there, about two or three weeks before the arrest
was made; we were up there three or four times; Officer Wise and
myself.</p>
<p>"Q State briefly what you saw on the occasion of these two investigations,
so far as your observation is limited to this woman.</p>
<p>"A in the first plce, we had information from different sources
<figure><ab>Wilbur &amp; Spencer
Attorneys-At-Law
Portland Oregon</ab></figure>
<fw>-6-</fw>
<pb/>
that there were Chinese prostitutes up there. We watched the place 
on several different occasions and saw Chinese going up there in the
rooms that the women were in. We went up there and talked to the 
women the best we could. At different times we found different men
in this woman's room. Finally, about 4:30 in the morning November
4th, we went up with the purpose of making her arrest and we found
a Chinese in bed with her.</p>
<p>"Q In your capacity, experience, and observation as a police officer
in the Chinese quarter on North Fourth Street, Portland, what have
you found to be the reputation of the place out of which this woman 
was arrested?</p>
<p>"A It has the reputation of being a bawdyhouse where prostitutes
ply their trade."</p>
<p>And the testimony of J.M. Wise, who is a police officer of
the City of Portland, whose testimony, so far as the virtue of said
Gwoo Shee Ah Look is concerned, is substantially as follows:</p>
<p>"Q When, where, and under what circumstances did you first see or 
meet this woman? (Gwoo Shee Ah Look)</p>
<p>"A Along about the 20th of October, this year, in room 17 of a 
building on the southwest corner of Fourth and Flanders Street,
this City." (Portland)</p>
<p>"Q Under what circumstances did you first see her?</p>
<p>"A Investigating the place, gaining evidence as to this place being
a house of prostitution and as to this woman being a prositute.</p>
<p>"Q Did you arrest this woman?</p>
<p>"A Yes, on the 4th day of November, about 4:30 in the morning."</p>
<p>That there was no other testimony relative to the character or acts
or prostitution of the said Gwoo Shee Ah Look.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further shows that she said Gwoo Shee Ah Look
is not a prostitute and that she has not practiced prostitution
within the United States or at any other place.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further shows that said Gwoo Shee Ah Look
<figure><ab>Wilbur &amp; Spencer
Attorneys-At-Law
Portland Oregon</ab></figure>
<fw>-7-</fw>
<pb/>
came to this country in company with her husband, Lau Wing Chew,
who she married in China, according to the Chinese customs; that
after her arrival within the United States said Lau Wing Chew deserted
said Gwoo Shee Ah Look and that thereafter she was married
to your petitioner, Wong Sing Lung, at Croville, California, some 
time during the year 1912, since which time she has lived with your
petitioner, Wong Sing Lung, as his wife;</p>
<p>Your petitoner further shows that the evidence before the
said commissioner and the secretary of Commerce and Labor showed
in substance that Gwoo Shee Ah Look came to the State of Oregon
on the 8th day of October, 1913, when said Gwoo Shee Ah Look went to live
with a respectable Chinese family, where she remained until the
first day of November, 1913, at which time, she, together with her
husband, rented a room at the place where said Gwoo Shee Ah Lok
was arrested.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further above that the affidavits in behalf
of said Gwoo Shee Ah Look showed in substance that she had not been
in the room or at the place where she was arrested until the first 
day of November, 1913, when she moved there with her husband.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further shows that the facts as above detailed
were showsn in the affidavits of Wong Sing Lung, Sue Key Line, Wong
Shee, Wong Ark, D.L. Huston and Wlater Bartholemew, all of which
were filed with the Commissioner in the City of Portland, attached 
to the record, and before the said Secretary of Commerce and Labor.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further shows that the sole and only testimony
upon which the said Secretary of Commerce and Labor has ordered the
deportation of said Gwoo Shee Ah Look was the testimony of said two
policemen, the substance of which has been set out herein, and that
their testimony that they saw her at the place of her arrest prior
to the first day of November, 1913., is untrue and case of mistaken
