    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Nicolas Brown filed for a writ of habes corpus on behalf of his sons, Alexander, aged 4, and George, aged 2. He alleged that his wife, Olive, took their sons Alexander and George and left the city of Seattle &#x201C;without his consent and without any provocation or cause whatsoever&#x201D;. Nicolas claimed that he should have custody over the children as he is better able to educate and support the said infants than their mother. Though a writ was issued, the petitioner&#x2019;s attorney motioned for the cause to be dismissed, and the case's outcome remains unknown.</li>
