    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On October 23, 1888, Michael Shrek was committed to the Whitman County Jail in Colfax, Washington for six months by justice of the peace William A. German in order to keep the peace and because he defaulted on his bail. Specifically, the document ordering his commitment says that a certain Frank Poshner's peace would be disturbed if Shrek were released. On December 19, 1888, he filed a writ of habeus corpus for his freedom against sheriff Lewis P. Berry. He claimed that the prison was an "unhealthy and unwholesome place," and that the damp conditions had caused him to contract an illness that he needed a doctor's care for. For the hearing on December 20, 1888, he subpoenaed several doctors to support his case. For his part, Berry claimed that he tried to keep the prison in the best conditions possible, and that if it was unhealthy, it was due to how it was constructed and where it was located, not anything Berry did. The outcome of this case is unclear, but according to the Pullman Herald, Shrek sued the county in February 1889 for $10,000 in damages as a result of his confinement.</li>
