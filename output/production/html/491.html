    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On October 5, 1920, Ruth McLane petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. She claimed that Marshall Eberstein (Chief of Police), Alta Berger (superintendent of Detention Hospital), and Dr. J. F Edwards (Health Commissioner) imprisoned, detained, confined, and restrained her of her liberty. In her petition, she argued her detention was illegal. The police arrested her in Omaha, charged with being the keeper of an ill-governed house, and the police magistrate found her guilty. The police magistrate sentenced her to 30 days in the country and the cost of prosecution. Following the proper process, she appealed the bond cost, and the police magistrate approved the appeal bond. However, instead of releasing her, the Edwards sent her to Detention Hospital, where Berger, the superintendent, confined her without a warrant. Berger wanted to perform physical tests on her, and after she refused, he threatened to use force to conduct the examination. She argued that her detention violated her rights under Article 5 of the Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and Section 11 of Article 1 of the Constitution of the State of Nebraska. The same day, the judge accepted the petition and ordered a writ of habeas corpus. The next day, Alta Burger responded to the writ, citing Ordinance No. 10509 to justify confining McLane. However, the outcome of this proceeding is unknown. </li>
