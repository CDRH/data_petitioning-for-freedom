<p>there were other persons also present; found nothing that would affect deceased a general health; heart was in its normal condition; examined cut in base of skull; wound could have been made by force of blunt instrument; the wheel of the engine could not do it; there was nothing to show that Lockwood fell in a fit; the body was in an unnatural position; it would have been difficult to lay in that position; the position was unnatural; rigor mortis setting in is extremely exceptional in case of death like this.</p>
<p>On ss examined: A part of the back of the skull was carried away; it might have been carried away from the direction of the back; the body could not have been forced--into the position it was found in--by the train.</p>
<p>The court at 4:15 p. m. adjourned to 10 a. m. to-day.</p>

<p>July 22, 1885</p>

<p>There was some delay in calling the case owing to the non-arrival of witnesses; but at 10:30 o'clock Judge Campbell called the court to order.</p>
<p>The first witness called was Robert Albright, who testified that he was a clerk at the C. R. &amp; N. Co's office on the wharf, that he kept an official record of the arrivals of steamers, and that the official time of the arrival of the Olympian on Wednesday last was 9:55 p. m.</p>
<p>Cross-examined: Could not say whether the Olympian was behind time on Tuesday night or not, but have official record.</p>
<p>Dr. Reich was then called, but it was ascertained that he was out of town.</p>
<p>The court then took a recess till 1 o'clock.</p>
<p>At 1 o'clock the court reconvened.</p>
<p>Dr. Reich, the first witness called, testified as to the autopsy performed by him on the body of William M. Lockwood, on the night of July 17th and 18th, in the presence of the <unclear></unclear> and other witnesses, <unclear>describe the</unclear> wounds on the body, and illustrated what potition the body must have had at the time of being run over; the position was an unnatural one; a body could be in such a position only in one of two cases; either the person laid down with deliberate intention of committing suicide, assuming studied position, or the dead body was placed there; there were so many injuries that he could not tell whether they were received before being run over or not; the engine could not have forced the body into the position as found, and if the man had fallen, the body could not have remained in such a position; the cramped position of the remains would exclude the theory of suicide; it was the voluntary position of either deceased, or was so placed by somebody else; if the head was struck by any part of the engine, there should be evidences of it; the force of the concussion would be sufficient to spatter the blood; no brain matter exuded from the head; portion of the <unclear></unclear> and scalp being gone, would have left evidence on the blunt instrument on that part of the engine striking; the engine would strike the feet first as the body lay, but quickly running over the feet it would probably not have any effect on the brain <unclear></unclear> upon how the speed of the <unclear></unclear> after striking, to make the brain <unclear></unclear> should think a lapse of a quarter of a second, after striking the fee till reaching the head, would convey to the brain a feeling; an engine goin at rate of ten miles an hour, the time elapsing after first striking body still reaching head might cause the brain to feel; the crushing of the feet would have the effect of numbing the nerves;</p>
