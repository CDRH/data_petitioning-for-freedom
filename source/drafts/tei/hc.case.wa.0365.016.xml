Q   How did you get that mining claim that you told me about your have over
    in Canada, if you had never became a citizen of Canada?
    A. In Canada if you came from England, France, or Germany, or - you
    could, if you were prospecting, you could go mining and prospecting.
    They never asked if you are a citizen or not.
Q   Did you ever become a citizen of Canada or not? A. No, sir, I did not.
Q   Wheen you entered the United States at Victoria the record shows that
    you stated you were a citizen of Canada, You claimed to be a Canadia
    citizen? A. Yes, yes, All very well. When you live in Canada, in
    a country 12 years, you are a Citizen, you think-
Q   You claimed it by reason of the length of time you lived there and not
    because of any papers? A. Yes, sir.
Q   Did you buy any property? A. Yes, I have a claim.

Q   Have you heard from them lately? A. No, sir, and I don't want
    to either from this place.
Q   What do they call you, John Matthews or Jack Matthews?
    A. Just call me Jack Matthews around Canada wherever I was, with the
    people I was working with.
Q   You got that name from your name from the Old Country- Yan?
    A. In the Old Country I was called Yanich Matevyeff. In my passport
    which has been wrote by the Austrian priest- Yan Matevyeff
Q   The English of that would be John Matthews or Jack Matthews?
    A. I have always, all my life had only one name since I came to Canada,
    The prient said, you take this name- Jack Matthews- Priest Wooley,
    in Cobalt. Write to the priest and he tell you all about it.
Q   You never declared your intention to become a citizen of the United
    States? A. No, sir. You fellows could write to Cobalt Police
    Station and they will give you my record because I never have been in - I
    have been in Cobald for 9 years and I never was one in trouble, but in
    the registration there they have my name, where I reported once a
    money. They could tell you who I am. Or write a Pichartin (?)
    I was working or to my mines where I was working, and you find out who
    I am, and if I was arrested for even about 24 hours or ever in trouble,
    I never arrested for an hour for 13 years. That in Alaska was my first
    trouble.</p>
