<p>That so 
great was the prejudice against defendant
during said examination that several times
when the public prosecutor vehemently de-
nounced defendant the large crowd in 
attendance <del>charged</del>, stamped their feet
in approval and when finally de-
fendant was by said Justices held
without bail for murder inthe
first degree the large crowd of people
in sttendance again manifested
their approval by stompling their feet
loudly, affiant further alleges upon
information and belief that at that
time large number of men were
engaged in railroad building in
this county and especially in the
south part of the county and that the
vehement ascertion that defendant 
shot deceased because he were beli-
evable. Together with false and ex-
agerated statements of the facts, were
reported among and by them not
only among themselves but
with the people of the county and
great prejudice thereby engendered
against defendant that during
and of the time of said examination are
thereafter for a long time to people of the city
of Spokane Falls and of various pertious
of this county were greatly excited con-
cerning this case and it was a there-
of constant discussion among all classes 
of people, and many false and exaggerated
statements, purporting to be the fact, in the
case tales and repeated until believed
and this applicant at that time and many
times since has held conversations
with officials of Spokane County
about this case who have expressed
opinoins and prejudices against
defendant and belief of her guilt
and applicant has been told by others of the instance
of great and almost universal prej-
udice against defendant <del>against 
defendant</del> That so great was the preju-
dice against defendant at time
of such examination that applicant
was denounced by some previous for
defending her in the courts, <del>that
applicant is informed and believes
and upon such information and
belief <unclear></unclear></del>
THat certain <del>when</del> citizens of Spokane
County, whose names are to applicant un-
known attempted to procure official command
partial the public prosecutor to prose-
cute defendant and on the habeas corpus
application of defendant to admit her
to bail special command did appear and
awish the public prosecutor but
whether whostaily or prove exemplified about
applicant does not know.
That a few days after the said justices had
held defendant wihtout bail for murder
in the first degree applicant on behalf of de-
fendant procured a writ of habeas corpus 
to issue from the judgeof this court to
admit defendant to bail and in said
application the evidence taken before
said justices and by then issued
to writing was considered by
said judge and defendant thereupon
admitted to bail in the sum of $5,000 that so
great was the prejudice of deft the people of
the county against defendant that they
command the judge very much for
allowing defendant bail, and
as applicant is reliably informed
thereinsaid to bail or hangs him in effigy
therefore; and so great was the prejudice
and opinion against defendant that
many people destined to go on her
"bail though amply secured, for fear of
public unrest and opinion and great
defficulty for her on a count of such
prejudice that concerning such understanding
to bail the said Daily Public Review published
in both its daily and weekly edition
the statement a copy of which is attached hereto
marked. That concerning said case
and the facts thereof said daily &amp; weekly
paper published in Spokane Falls of general circulation is the paper published matters concerning
this case and the killing of Finch
Copies of which are sttached hereto
and marked with date of their publi-
cation and by F.G. H all to the prejudice of deft.
Another fact which tended greatly to
excite and prejudice the people of the county
against this defendant is the fact that
at the time of the killing of Finch an election
was pending in wearly in all of the precincts
of this coounty <del>and about</del> and in Spokane
Falls and about to take place, upon
the question of the prohibiting the sale
of intoxicating liquid and a great
effort was being made by <del>all of the</del> those
in favor and against prohibition
for the influency of their republic
views at such election. THe advocates
of prohibition at Spokane Falls a
might of his after the killing to wit-
June 27, 1886, held a public meeting
which was attended by several hun-
dred citizens of Spokane County, and
which meeting was addressed by
one Norman White, are eloquent and
experienced believer on important and
in her address in that might she as applicant is informed and believes
addressing the guilt of defendant 
pointed to the killing of Finch as
an example of the evils of heresaid
saloons, and applicant is informed
this cause argument was used by
advocates of prohibition generally in
this county before such election and
that many anti-prohibitionists
were greatly concerned at defendant
for having as was alleged afforded
this argument against them
and that is all tended greatly
to the prejudice of defendant with 
many good people of the county 
of such so that applicant has heard of
prominent citizens and temperance
men of Spokane County wihtin the last
three weeks say in speaking of the act
of the judge of this court in admitting
defendant to bail and referring to the
case and to what was termed the
saloon element Les. and when one of
them kills a man they let her out
on bail, "words to that effect
and in Sep. 23, 1886 the Spokane Tribue
a weekly newspaper then published
in Cheney, Spokane County, published
the Following publication reference to
this case.
"The County Commissioners have had
to increase our taxes 2 mills this year to
pay for the prosecuting of the 12 saloon
-Ray Raymond- criminals, might
have during the last twelve months from
Spokane."
[in tribunal page, Sept. 23, 1886]
Which said Tribuna is the acknowledged
upon of the prohibitionists, of this 
county, of and of very general cir-
culation as applicant is informed
and believes throughout every
portion of Spokane County, and
very influential with its readers
that from conversations had with
people of said county and from all of the
information applicant has been able to
obtain he believes that this prejudice
against defendant has not died
out but is still in existence among
the people of the county, both men and
women, and so wide-spread and
universal that defendant cannot
guard against i in the selections
of a jury and the prejudice is so great 
and intense and so existant
among all classes of people of the
county that even if a jury could be
obtained free from prejudice, which 
applicant does not believe possible,
under the circumstances, applicant
leave that such prejusice would
be so strong and apparent unto
applocant in jury before the conclusion
of the trial, there false rumors and
reports, and this prejudice are especially
dangeroud to defendant in this case 
on account of the charges against
her, and the nature of the defense
thereto which must not largely
in the absence of sriminal intent
at the time of the shooting, applicant
has informed himself of the true facts
in this case and of defendant
defense having as verily as possible and
believes she has a good and meritous
defense herein and one that can be
made available if she is given a fair
trial.  Thomas C. Griffiths
