<p>In the matter of the application of NG KWACK KANG, for a Writ of habeas corpus.</p>
<p>NO. 3157</p>
<p>Petition of NG KWACK KANG, by and through ADAM BEELER, of the law firm of BEELER and SULLIVAN,
his attorney.</p>
<p>Comes now ADAM BEELER, of the firm of BEELER and SULLIVAN, Attorneys, as attorney for and in
behalf of NG KWACK KANG, a son of NG KUM, an American citizen of Boston, State of Massachusetts, and
respectfully makes this application for a Writ of habeas corpus, and alleges as follows:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>That the said NG KWACK KANG, is imprisoned and restrained of his liberty bu the United States
Commissoner of Immigration, HENRY M. WHITE, or by some person or persons acting through, by, or
under him, and that said NG KWACK KANG is imprisoned at the Detention House at the Immigration
Station in the City of Seattle, King County, State of Washington, and within the jurisdiction of the
above entitled court, under the charge that the said NG KWACK KANG is an alien, a subject to the
President fo the Chinese Republic, and has no legal right to be admitted into the United States, and
that he should be deported according to law; and your pretitioner further informs this Honorable
Court that said imprisonment, restraint and Order of Deportation is illegal arising from the
following facts, to-wit: That the said NG KWACK KANG was denied admittance into the United States on
the ground that he was not legaly entitled to be admitted therein; that said NG KWACK KANG was given
a hearing by the Immigration officials on or about the 30th day of June, 1915; that further evidence
was teaken in said case by the Department of Labor, through
<pb/>
the Immigration officials; and that on the 16th day of August, 1915, an Order was issued by the
Commissioner of Immigration at Seattle, finding that said NG KWACK KANG was not entitled to enter or
remain in the United States, and that he should be deported; that an appeal was taken by said NG
KWACK KANG, through his attorney in Boston, Massachusetts, to the Secretary, then on October 21st,
1915, said Order of Deportation was affirmed by the Assistant Secretary, and said NG KWACK KANG was
ordered deported.</p>
<p>Your petitioner is informed and believes, and so states the fact to be, that said Commissioner of
Immigration, HENRY M. WHITE, of Seattle, Washington, in charge of the District of Washington, or his
agent or agents, acting by, under, or through him, for the United States Government, is about to
deport and return the said NG KWACK KANG to China, in violation of the treaty relations between the
United States and CHina, and in violation of the laws and statutes of the United States in relation
to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and in violation of the laws relative to the acts and powers of the
Secretary of Labor and the Assistant Secretary of Labor, in that said NG KWACK KANG is being
deprived of his liberty without due process of law and without being given a fair hearing by said
Commissioner of Immigration, HENRY M. WHITE, or his agents or officials, acting by, under or through
him, or for the United States Government.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further alleges that the right of appeal from the finding of Commissioner of
Immigration, HENRY M. WHITE, or his agents or officials, acting by, under or through him, or for the
United States Government in and for the District of Washington, by the statutes in such cases made
and provided for in relation to the Chinese Exclusion Laws, has been violated and that his full
rights have not been accorded to your petitioner, NG KWACK KANG in this: that W.B. WILSON is the
Secretary of Labor, and LOUIS POST
<pb></pb>
is his only Assistant Secretary of Labor; that the said appeal of said NG KWACK KANG to the
Secretary of Labor, from the decision denying the right to enter and remain in the United States,
came up for hearing and consideration, and under the law should have been heard by the said
Secreatry of Labor, unless the said Secretary being absent, then said Assistant Secretary should
act, but that the said Order affirming the finding of the said Commissioner of Immigration of
Seattle, is amde by and in the name of the Assistant Secretary, without designating any name or
authority so vested in said Asistant Secretary, or that the said Secretary was absent and not able
to perform his duty, and that the said Secretary of Labor neglected or refusing to hear or consider
said appeal, and hence the said NG KWACK KANG has been denied his right of appeal, according to law.</p>
<p>Your petitioner on information and belief, further states that the said NG KWACK KANG has not had
a fair and impartial trial before the said Commissioner of Immigration at Seattle, King County,
Washington; that there is no evidence in the records to sustain the Exclusion and Deportation Order;
that said decision is arbitrary and not supported bu the evidence, and taht said NG KWACK KANG,
after the Department had given him a hearing before the Immigration Official at Seattle, Washingotn,
was not advised of his right to have witnesses appear for and in his behalf; taht said NG KWACK KANG
was denied the right to face the wirnesses whose testimony was taken by the United States
Government, or the right of cross-examination thereof, and that evidence was taken without NG KWACK
KANG being then and there facing said witnesses who gave evidence for and in behalf of the United
States Government.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further states that said NG KWACK KANG was denied a fair hearing, in that
private confidential letters passed between the Immigration Officials and the officials of the
<pb></pb>
Department of Labor at Washington, and that NG KWACK KANG was not apprised of the said
communications, or given the right to cross-examine the parties who wrote said letters, and that
said parties who wrote said lettrs were not under oath, and said letters were prejudicial, were not
lega evidence, and the writing and consideration of same in connection with NG KWACK KANG's case
denied him a fair and impartial hearing.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further alleges that NG KWACK KANG is a minor son of an American Citizen, NG KUM,
his father having been discharged from custody by United States District Judge Cox of the Northern
District of New York, on Aprill 11th, 1901, and to deny NG KWACK KANG of his right to enter and
remain in the United States, is depriving him of his liberty without due process of law, and is in
violation of the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, your peitioner prays that this court find that said NG KWACK KANG has not been
accorded the rights and privileges as allowed by law, and that he has not been given a fair and
impartial trial, and tahat he is a son of an American citizen, and that he be discharged allowed to
join his father, who is an American citizen in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
