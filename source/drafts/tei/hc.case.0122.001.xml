<p>In the District Court of Columbia County
Washington Territory, holding terms at Day-
ton.</p>

<p>Before Hon. William G. Langford Judge
of the above named Court.</p>

<p>In the matter of the
application of
S.M. McFarland
for a Writ of
Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Complaint</p>

<p>To the Hon. William
G. Langford Judge of the above Court and as-
sociate Justice of the Subpoena Court of the
Territory of Washington.</p>

<p>The petitition of S.M. McFarland the plain-
tiff respectfully shows:
1st That he is illegally imprisoned detained
contained and restrained of his liberty
by N.R. Marquiss Sheriff of Colum-
bia County, Washington Territory, that
he is now confined by your Sheriff in the County Jail at the
City of Dayton in the County and Territory aforesaid.</p>

<p>2nd That the causes or pretense of such
imprisonment and restraint according
to the best of the knowledge and belief of the ap-
plicant is this; that applicant was
brought before W.H Kuhn one of the Jus-
tices of the Peace in and for Columbia
County Washington Territory, for exami-
nation upon a charged of having removed
certain personal property upon which he had
given a Mortgage from the County of Col-
umbia, Where said property was situated
at the date of said mortgage, and before said
Mortgage was duly released or without the
consent in writing of the mortgage, and upon
such examination the said Justice of the Peace
ordered the said applicant to be held to answer
said charge before the Grand Jury of Columbia
County. And the said Sheriff N.R. Marquiss
Claims to hold keep imprision and restrain ap-
plicant of his liberty by virtue of a commit-
ment issued by said Justice of the Peace au-
thorizing him to take into his custody and
safely keep said applicant</p>

<p>3rd That such restraint is illegal in this
that the complaint upon which said appli-
cant was arrested and examined does not
charge the commission of any acts which are
made criminal by the laws of Washington
Territory, and that the said charge upon which
the applicant was arrested examined and
committed is not a crime or offense un-
der the laws of Washington Territory or any
law</p>

<p>That said Sheriff N.R. Marquiss has no
writ of committment issued by said Jus-
tice of the Peace or any Justice charging or
accusing the applicant with having commit-
ted any crime or offense known by the law</p>

<p>That said Justice of the Peace had no legal
or probable cause to commit the applicant
to answer said charge or any charge and said
Committment does not charge any crime or
offense known to the law.</p>

<p>Wherefor he pays for Writ of Habeas
Corpus, that the same may be inquired into
and he be dischared.</p>
