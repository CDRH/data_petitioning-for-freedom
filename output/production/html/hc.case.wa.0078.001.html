      <p class="tei_p">The petition of Ah Foong respectfully shows</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I</p>
      <p class="tei_p">That said Ah Foong is unlawfully imprisoned, detained, confined and restrained of his liberty by William Murphy Acting Chief Police of said City of Seattle in the City Jail at Seattle in King County, Washington Territory that the said Ah Foong is a subject of the Emperor of China</p>

      <p class="tei_p">II</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That said imprisonment, detention, confinement and restraint are illegal, and the illegality thereof consists <del/> in this to wit that the said pretended Ordinance No 705, by virtue of which your petitioner was convicted and committed as aforesaid is unconstitutional, illegal and void, for the reason that the said City of Seattle had not at the time of making said Ordinance, any power to make the same.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That said pretended Ordinance is unequal in this operation; <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">oppressive[?]</span> in restraint of trade and in contravention of common rights and in opposition to the laws and treaties of the United States.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Wherefore your petitioner prays that a writ of habeas corpus may be granted, directed to the <del>sheriff</del> said William Murphy, acting Chief of Police of the City of Seattle commanding him to have the body of the said Ah Foong before your honor at a time and place specified to do and receive what shall
