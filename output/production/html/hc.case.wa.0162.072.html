      <p class="tei_p">In the District Court
Fourth Judicial District 
holding terms
at Spokane Falls.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington<br/>
vs.<br/>
Ray Raymond</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I J.J. Piper being duly 
sworn on my oath depose
and say that I am now
and for the past six years
have been a resident of the
precinct of Peone in Spokane
County Washington Territory.
That I have had a casual
knowledge that there was such
a case as the above named
ever since the homicide out
of which it grew. That I 
am well acquainted with
the people residing in said
Peone precinct and have
personal acquaintance with
the greater share of them,
and have opportunity to hear
the opinion and sentiments
of the people of said precinct 
expressed and in a

<span class="hr"> </span>

general way know the same.
That I have never heard
any expression of hostility to
or prejudice against said
defendant Ray Raymond by
the residents of said precinct.
That if there was prejudice
and ill will existing against
her there, I should most
certainly have heard the
same expressed.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">That from my best information 
the alleged facts relating 
to the homicide out
of which said action grew,
are not generally known
to the people of said precinct 
and that they generally
have not formed an opinion 
as to the guilt or innocence 
of said defendant,
and that the people of said 
precinct are not prejudiced
against said Ray Raymond
affiant further said that
there are about four hundred 
people living in said
Peone precinct and that
applicant verily believes that
a large number of good
unprejudiced and legally
qualified jurors can be
summoned and secured
in said precinct to serve
as jurors in said action.
And further affiant
saith not.</p>
