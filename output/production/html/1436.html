    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On May 17, 1918, Clara May Pearce filed for Habeas against mother-in-law, Julia Pearce, for keeping her 17-month-old, George Taylor Pearce, from her. A writ was ordered and on May 18, Judge Redick ruled that the infant be placed in custody of the father and mother. Newspapers give details of personal relationships and speak of ongoing public divorce between Clara and Harry Pearce. Clara accused Harry of threatening her with a revolver and beating her, as well as forcing her to ride while she was pregnant. The couple made up in November 1918 after Harry literally went down on his knees and begged her to take him back. </li>
