"The preliminary examination of the 
woman Ray Raymond arrested for the
killing of James Finch resulted in a decision 
that she be held to await the action
of the grand jury on charge of murder in
the first degree. The decision fell with
crushing might on the accused. She was
taken to Sprague and brought back here
early this week on a writ of habeas corpus.
Considerable time has been spent by the
attorneys for the defense, in an endeavor
to show that confinement in jail would
be very detrimental to the health of the accused, 
would perhaps endanger her life.
Should this endeavor prove successful, bail
may be received. Under the laws of the territory
murder in the first degree is not bailable,
where the evidence of guilt is strong, except
in cases where it is shown that the above 
mentioned dangers are very probable. Yesterday 
nearly the entire medical force of the
city was called to testify as to the woman's
ability to bear the confinement of the
jail."</p>
