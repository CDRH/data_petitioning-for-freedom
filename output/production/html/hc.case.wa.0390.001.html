      <p class="tei_p">Before me, James K. Kennedy, Judge 
of the 1st judicial district of Washington
Territory, personally appeared
this 13th day of October, 1869, James McAuliff, 
Sheriff of Walla Walla County, who 
makes oath and says that he has reason
to believe, and verily does believe
that one John Suelling committed the crime 
of Grand Larceny in the County of Umatilla,
State of Oregon, in the latter part of the 
year 1868; that he was committed to the 
County jail of said county on said charge,
that he sawed his way out of said jail,
and made his escape therefrom, and
is now a fugitive from justice; that the 
Sheriff of Umatilla County has made 
an application to the Governor of the 
State of Oregon for a requisition on the 
Governor of Washington Territory for the
body of the said John Suelling to answer
said charge.</p>
