<ab>IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, IN AND FOR THE DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON. 
NORTHERN DIVISION.</ab>

<ab>In the Matter of the application
of Lee Fong for a writ of 
Habeas Corpus</ab>

<ab>1036</ab>

<p>To the Hon. C.H.Hanford, Judge of the above entitled Court. 
The petition and complaint of Lee Fong respectfully shows; That he is of chinese
birth and a resident of the City of Seattle in said District of Washington, where
for seven (7) years last past he has been engaged in the occupation and business of
a laundryman; that in the month of June last past, he leased the premises No.1410 east
Fir Street, in the City of Seattle,State of Washington, for the purpose of coverting
the same into a laundry, and therein carrying on the business of a laundry; that
upon a building permit being issued by the proper authorized building inspector, in
said City of Seattle, to whom had been submitted for inspection, and who approved of
the specifications prepared for the conversion of said premises into a laundry, he
incurred an expenditure of upwards of six hundred dollars ($600.) in making the
necessary changes, additions and improvements in and on said premises required for
the purpose of conducting said laundry business, all of which was done in accordance
with said specifications for said laundry, approved and authorized as aforesaid by
said building inspector in said City of Seattle. That after he had made said expenditures
upon said authority, a petition from certain persons was addressed to
the common Council of the City of Seattle, praying that said body should refuse its
consent to, and prohibit the establishment of a laundry, designated in said
petition as a "Chinese laundry", on said premises; that said Council, in compliance 
with said petition granted the prayer thereof and witheld its consent
to this petitioner to establish or carry on his proposed laundry upon said premises</p>

<ab>1</ab>

<pb/>

<p>and that this petitioner had no hearing before said Council or their committee 
having said petition in charge; that the said Laundry has been so constructed and arranged
as to be in a good sanatory condition, of which the health officer in said
City of Seattle has delivered a certificate; and that all proper precautions were
taken by the petitioner in the preparation of said premises for his laundry
business, for the protection of property <add>from</add> injury or destruction by fire.</p>

<p>That notwithstanding the premises, your petitioner has been arrested upon a complaint,
a copy of which is hereto attached, and made a part hereof, and that he is
now unlawfully imprisoned, detained, confined and restrained of his liberty by
John Sullivan, Chief of Police of said City of Seattle, at and in the City Jail of said
City. That the said imprisonment, detention, confinement and restraint is illegal,
and that the illegality thereof consists in this, to-wit; That said arrest and 
imprisonment &amp; Sections six (6) and seven (7) of ordinance NO.710, of the City of
Seattle, for the alleged violation of which this petitioner has been arrested,
and is now imprisoned and restrained of his liberty as aforesaid, are in violation 
of, and in conflict with the constitution of the United States, and especially
of the fifth (5th) and fourteenth (14th) amendments thereto; And also that said
arrest and imprisonment is in violation of the treaty made and existing between
the Government of the United States, and that of the Empire of China, the chief objection
and opposition to the petitioner's laundry being that it is to be conducted
by a chinaman, and that said ordinance which petitioner is charged with having violated,
and the whole thereof, isnull and void.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE, your petitioner prays that a writ of Habeas
Corpus may be granted directed to the said John Sullivan, Chief of police of the City
of Seattle, commanding him to have the body of the said Lee Fong before your Honor at
a time and place therein to be specified, to do and receive what shall then and
there be considered right by your Honor concerning him, together with the time
and cause of his said detention and said writ.</p>
