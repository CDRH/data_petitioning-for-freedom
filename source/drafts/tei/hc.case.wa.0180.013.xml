<p>Exhibit "A"
Statement of Saito, Hana</p>
<p>Case of Albert H. Young
and Kamasaburo Sugiura
arrested under Departmental
warrant.</p>
<p>Tacoma, Washington
October 16, 1913</p>
<p>Inspector Alfred T. White
Examining officer and
Reporter</p>
<p>Hana Saito, appeared, was sworn and testified as follows:</p>
<p>Examiningofficer: Q What is your name?
Witness A Saito, Hana.</p>
<p>Q What is your age and where were you born?</p>
<p>A I am 28 years old and was born in Japan.</p>
<p>Q Are you the same Saito, Hana who testified in court in the case of
U.S. vs Albert H. Young, Kamasaburo Sugiura, et al?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Tell briefly what your testimony was in that case.</p>
<p>A When I was working at the Iroha Resturant, 1340 C St., Tacoma, on
or about 9 p.m., August 10, 1912, Young and Sugiura and a white man
came to the resturant and Young asked for a girl named Tsune. I told
him there was no girl working there of that name and he then showed me
a photograph of myself and told me I was under arrest and that he
came from the Immigration Office. I sent the boss of the restaraunt
to Saito, my husband, asking him to bring me my hat which he did.
Young said they were going to put me into jail and I thoght I was
arrested because Saito and I ran away from San Francisco. I asked if
they were from the Immigration Office at San Francisco or from the
police and Young said they were from the police; I asked him if he
had anything to do with the Immigration Office and he said "If you
dont come with us your will be turned over to the Immigration officers"
They afterwards said that I had stolen $1500.00 from Washio and that
they had a warrant for my arrest, showing me a printed paper of some
kind with my photograph on. They then took me to Seattle where they
kept me in a hotel for several days. I stayed one night in a hotel
3 or 4 blocks away from where we got off the car (Young, Sugiura, the
white man and myself) and the next day they took me to another plac e
a little ways off from there. The boss of the hotel was told not to
let me out along so I could not get away. They then took me to San
Francisco by a steamer sailing about August 16th, 1912, and we were
met at the dock in San Francisco by Ito and his wife. Theyre then took
me to the house at 10120 Stockton St, the Kimparo, where I had been
practicing prostitution under Washio prior to the time I ran away with
Saito. There they told me I must work until I paid Washio $1500.00.</p>
<p>Q Who is this man Ito?</p>
<p>A The man who ran the Kimparo.</p>
<p>Q Were the statments made by you in court true?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Dis you at any time prior to your departure from Seattle for San
Francisco tell Young and Sugiura or either of them that you had formerly
practiced prostitution at the house at 1020 Stockton st?</p>
<fw>10</fw>
<pb/>
<p>A No, but Sugiura said while we were on board the ship that they
would take me back to the house where I had been practicing prostitution
before. They knew I had been a prostitute because Washio told
them.</p>
<p>Q Do you know who purchased your transportation to San Francisco?</p>
<p>A Young and Sugiura did. They bought tickets on a boat sailing earlier
and took me to the ticket office to get the tickers cancellec.</p>
<p>Q Do you know if they received any monty for taking you to San Franscico?</p>
<p>A I heard later that they got $250.00 from Ito and Uneda.</p>
<p>Q Why did you leace San Francisco with Saito?</p>
<p>A Because I wanted to stop practicing prostitution and Washio would
make me keep it up by threatening me with a gun.</p>
<p>Q What wasthe reputation at the time of your return in August, 1912?</p>
<p>A The same. It never changed. The only difference was that it was
under different management.</p>
<p>Q How many girls were in the house when you went back?</p>
<p>A Three.</p>
<p>Did you know the girls?</p>
<p>They were prostitutes, I knew them.</p>
<p>Is there anything else you wish to say?</p>
<p>No, I have told you the truth</p>
