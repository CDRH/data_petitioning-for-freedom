    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On May 25, 1916, Dicey Hays, a resident of Sarpy County, Nebraska asked a justice of the peace to swear a warrant against the father of "her bastard son." The accusation and statement made by Dicey Hays is not included in the case file. There are details to the charges other than that she claimed Fred Jolly was the father of her child. The justice of the peace issued a bond for Jolly's appearance in court. Jolly's application claimed that this justice of the peace in Sarpy county issued the bond for Jolly to appear in Douglas County court, outside of his jurisdiction. Jolly was arrested on June 1, 1916 and placed in jail "in default of bail." Jolly's application for a writ claimed that the justice in Sarpy County "wholly neglected his duties" and "having no jurisdiction... made a pretended finding" and was detaining Jolly "wholly illegally and unlawfully." The petition was granted and request was copied to Sheriff McShane, but further details are unknown.</li>
