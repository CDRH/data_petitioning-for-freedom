      <p class="tei_p">Statement of Robert A. Reilly--</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I saw the negro Blackburn 
at the jail this morning. last summer a year. he saw on the boat 
of which I was captain, the Steam Boat Michigan, as Cabin boy. he was on board my boat 
as a free person, I am satisfied he is free, I am always particular in 
hiring colored servants, and was particular during the summer mentioned. I am under 
the impression that he was on the "Minnesota" steam boat of which I 
was Master in 1849. he this morning related to me circumstances that 
transpired on the "Minnesota" that season that causes me to have the 
impression that he was that season on the boat or he could not have been aware of the circumstances I know he was on 
the "Michigan" as I have stated</p>
