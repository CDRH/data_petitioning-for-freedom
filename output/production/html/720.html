    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Grace Miller, next friend and presumed relative of Herold James Miller, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that Herold was being deprived of his liberty by Sadie Kingery, Elmer P. Quivey, and "the Nebraska Childrens' Home Society, a corporation." Quivery responded to the summons on behalf of the Nebraska Childrens' Home Society, a private adoption agency, and objected to the jurisdiction of the court over the Douglas County-based corporation. The court sustained the objection and dismissed the cause. The fate of the bound party is unknown. </li>
