    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Dennis Griffin files for a writ of Habeas Corpus to regain custody of his daughter, Julia Griffin. Julia G. was put in the custody of Julia and John Sullivan after Dennis Griffin's wife, the daughter of Julia and John Sullivan, was institutionalized in 1893, and later died. Since 1893, custody of said child changed many times between the Sullivans, Catharine Griffin (sister of Dennis), Ellen Koons, and Dennis Griffin. Griffin accused Ellen Koons, the girl's aunt, of kidnapping her from Dennis's sister while she was in her custody in Ottumway, Iowa. Dennis sought to place Julia G. in a convent near Ottumwa so that he could see her more frequently. Judge Baker found that it was in the best interest of Julia Griffin to remain in the custody of her grandparents. Dennis Griffin is afforded the ability to visit Julia Griffin at all reasonable times at the Sullivan residence. During the trial, Julia G. displayed a clear preference for her father, running up to him and kissing him as the verdict was read out. There was a class difference between the parties, as, according to the Omaha Evening Bee, the Sullivans "incline[d] towards the aristocratic," while Griffin was "a brawny laborer who can scarcely sign his name." </li>
