      <p class="tei_p"> To Hon. Jno. Colvin, Law Commissioner 
&amp;c </p>

      <p class="tei_p">The undersigned Eliza Duncan is imprisoned and restrained of her liberty in this 
Calaboose or commons jail of the city of St 
Louis, St. Louis County and State of Missouri. Altho' colored, she is free, and is well 
known to be so to many citizens of St. Louis. 
She knows not why or by whom she has been 
taken and detained. There is no charge 
against her in any of the Courts, nor 
does she know any just reason why there 
should be now so far as she can learn 
is there any authority for her arrest or process for her detention. 
She states her imprisonment and detention 
is by the keeper of said calaboose, named 
Wm. Lawlor. That the same is illegal. 
That petitioner is free, has committed 
no violation of law, and she knows of 
no reason why she should be there farther 
detained. She therefore prays a writ of Habeas Corpus 
be issued for her instant relief from farther imprisonment</p>
