<p>Frankie Snitzinger Sworn</p>

<p>I live in Spokane 
Falls W.T. have resided here two 
years last October was in attendance 
here at this trial yesterday heard 
part of the testimony of Dr. Morgan 
heard the testmony of Jno Maybess
no 33 is My house the one spoken 
of in his testimony Heard <add>part of</add> the description
given by Dr Morgan giving the description
of the dead Man, there such a person 
called at my place, a little before 
11 PM night of 25th, He was in 
the house my front door was open 
and he walked in no one gave him 
permission when my front door is open 
the inside is shut He was quite 
happy from his manner He came 
in the front and opened my parlor 
door and I said how do you do
he said is my friend here I say 
says no there has been no one 
here he said my friend said 
he was coming here and I think 
he is here, no I told him no 
one was here he would know 
No strangers had been here he 
answered by saying you are a 
lying, Old Bitch I told him not 
to speak like that and he reached 
up his hands and said I have a 
notion to break your face

<pb/>

I says dont break my face he 
says I feel like doing it you 
D-D hoars are to smart in this 
town you want to get licked 
I said to him you would not 
strike an old lady lets come
promise and take a drink he
says no I wont treat if you'll 
treat I'll drink I asked him to 
sit down and if you will treat 
first then I will, I was there alone 
and a little araid of him</p>

<p>He stepped past me to my dressing
room door and I turned round 
and said I don't want you to go 
in there, there is no one in there 
he reached out and took me 
by the arm and said I will 
go in there I'll kick the belly 
off you I reached my hand 
up to him and took hold of 
the little cord <add>on his shirt</add> and said dont 
be cross lets be friends he 
said no I want my friend</p>

<p>I asked him who his friend 
was he said little fellow that 
came with him off the R.R. and 
described Johnny Maybiess saying 
he had reason to believe he was 
there because he had asked for 
Miss Zoe and was told she

<pb/>

got a 33 and heard Johny as 
looking for her he said my little
Miss told me <add>I</add> asked him to stay 
that may be his friend would 
come said no he would go 
and hunt him he stood while 
he was there would not sit down 
was quite intoxicated and reeling
when he went out he managed
to get into the dressing room then 
out into the hall and out I followed 
him to the hall door and then locked 
it, Had no hat on</p>

<p>Cross</p>

<p>I was talking about a man 
dont know his name, never saw 
him before, nor since, no I 
never heard his name dont 
presume to say he was the man 
did not see him after he was 
dead no one else heard this 
language I was alone I 
asked him to sit down done 
all I could to quiet him I asked 
him to treat to a glass beer 
yes I have beer there </p>

<p>Redirect</p>

<p>he was a man answering the <unclear>description</unclear>
gven by Dr. Morgan yesterday</p>

<p>Re Cross</p>

<p>I was here in the room while Dr
Morgan gave his testimony</p>

<pb/>

<p>Redirect</p>

<p>He was above the av heighth he stood 
very near me I had to look up to 
see him light faded Moustache 
Drooped heavy at the Corners a little 
sunken in the cheeks heavy chin 
heavy forhead <del/> heavy over
his eyes hands rough working 
hands. had them on her face was
harsh <add>his</add> face clean and hair 
smooth Face smooth except 
Moustache looked as though 
had just cleand up upper clothing 
clean lower soiled smeared somewhat
no Hat on asked him where 
it was Corn blue overalls</p>

<p>I did not see the man after 
he was dead am describing the 
Man who Called at my house</p>

<p>Recross</p>

<p> Had rough weather beaten hands
did not like them on my 
face had on Blue Overalls I 
dont presume to say he was the 
Man is what I said, He came 
there asking for his friend and 
Called him Johny and described 
Johny Maybiess the reason I 
tought it was Maybiess was because 
he inquired for a little fellow 
that got acquainted with Zoe
at Coeur d'Alene I knew Johny 

<pb/> 
<!-- pages from SPO-1886-16 -->
Maybiess before, my front door 
stands open good deal in 
warm weather <add>at night</add> I know the 
Prisoner at the bar, Prisoner has 
not talked with me about my 
testimony have not set by her 
ever Counsler has only asked 
me if such a man visited my 
home</p>

<p>Redirect</p>

<p>Saw a torn peice of paper that looked 
like the one he had it in his hand 
I asked him to treat you perhaps
need your quarter to get something to 
eat he says no I've got 
money if I could get money &amp;
my papers I could buy your old 
house showed me a small square
piece of paper whch seemed to me
<unclear></unclear> that looked like this, torn Across 
the Center folds Said a man 
worked hard in this country and got 
less ¢ on the dollar for his work</p>

<p>Recross</p> 

<p>No only by the size and appearance 
and only by its being torn dont presume
to say it was the same man that was 
killed beacuse I did not see him </p>

30th 1886</p>
