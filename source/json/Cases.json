But I don't believe it's because Hammond purchased Anson; I'm fairly sure he was the deputy sheriff acting as jailer. Hammond appears as the holding party in a few other of the Missouri cases. Plus, there's this incredibly problematic law enforcement webpage claiming he was killed in 1836 (https://www.odmp.org/officer/5990-deputy-sheriff-george-hammond). \n\nAs for other freedom suits, I think we should distinguish between freedom suits, fugitive slave suits, and kidnapping suits. In kidnapping suits, the holding party is often going to be the kidnappers, although this suit shows that kidnappers occasionally deposited the people they seized with third parties. In freedom suits that don't involve kidnappers, the holding party is most likely going to be the enslaver. Is this helpful?\n\nP.S. It occurs to me that we don't actually have the habeas petition for this case. We have the petition for a writ of trespass/assault/false imprisonment, and we have the writ of habeas corpus, but we don't have the petition for the writ of habeas corpus. Should we assume that William Clark supplied that petition, too?\n\n<airtable:mention id=\"menHEbipq3ZBSbExy\">@Cory Young</airtable:mention>\u00a0this reading makes more sense to me; let's label Hammond as the holding party and jailer, while we label the Henrys as the kidnappers. I'm not ready to make a general rule, since I think many of these petitions will be idiosyncratic.\n\nThere's actually no habeas *petition*, here. Anson's next friend, William Clark, did not ask for the writ, but rather for five hundred dollars on a bill of trespass and assault. The judge appears to have issued a writ of habeas corpus of his own accord in order to proceed with the fact finding.",

        "Notes": "Coley Harris was arrested and jailed on suspicion of being a fugitive from slavery. She declared that she was a free woman and petitioned the St. Louis Criminal Court for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted by one Judge Lackland. After hearing the evidence, she was released. However, Harris, in consultation with her attorney, was then arrested and jailed for a second time in an attempt to prevent her original kidnapper, Rueben Bartlett, from seizing her again. This time she petitioned the St. Louis Commissioner's Court for a writ of habeas corpus, which was also granted. Upon hearing the evidence, Harris was once again released.\n\nMark Twain believed that Harris had been posing as a slave to avoid punishment for having entered the state as a free Black woman without proper license.

He argues in his habeas corpus petition that police judge Albert F. Parsons violated his right to due process and that his business, a general goods store, exempts him from following the ordinance; therefore, he was being deprived of his liberty by Marshall P. H. Cooper. In April of 1888, Judge Allen Field remanded Leiberman into custody until he was released on bond on April 24th on the sum of $100. ",

Houston was tasked with receiving a disposition from Bertha Dogge on a civil case Hart Bros., et al vs Otto Dogge, Bertha Dogge, and Christian G. Herald. Bertha Dogge refused, and Houston found her in contempt of court and ordered her arrest. On July 22nd, 1886 Bertha Dogge petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that sheriff Samuel Melick had unlawfully deprived her of her freedom. After examining the evidence, Judge Pound remanded her into the custody of Melick. The next day, Supreme Court Judge Amasa Cobb upheld the decision, but he allowed Bertha to file a writ of error and ruled that Bertha be able to be released on her own recognizance provided that she pay a sum of $250.",

        "Notes": "Samuel Carr petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve his two young sons, Harry and Herbert Carr, from William and Nina Helms, which was granted. A few years earlier, Samuel had placed the boys in the Home for the Friendless in Lincoln, Nebraska, from which institution the Helmses obtained custody of the two. The Helmses did not formally adopt Harry and Herbert, whom they put to work in their traveling minstrel show. After hearing the evidence, Harry and Herbert were released back into the custody of the Home for the Friendless. The judge ordered that Samuel could retrieve his children once he demonstrated that he could properly care for them and after he paid off his debt to the state. \n\nFor background on this case, see the 15 and 16 November 1906 issues of the Hastings Daily Republican. https://www.newspapers.com/clip/97397389/samuel-l-carrs-habeas-corpus-petition/\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/97397717/samuel-l-carrs-habeas-corpus-petition/",
