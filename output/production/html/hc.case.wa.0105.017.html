Heard shots about dark, Riley was at my house

Riley acknowledged to me he killed the Indian; 
because the Indian attacked him (Riley) with 
a knife which he pulled out of his hand 
and then stabbed him. Riley said he would 
have to give something to the Indian to make 
it up. There was blood on his person.</p>
