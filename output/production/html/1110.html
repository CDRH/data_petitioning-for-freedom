    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Mathias Donermeyer, grandfather and petitioner for Virginia Donermeyer, files a writ of Habeas Corpus to have custody of Virginia. Virgina's parents, John and Anastasia Kahoun, had both died in 1906. Virginia also had an older brother named Matthew or Mathias. The court found that Virginia Donermeyer should remain in the custody of Minnie Loesch, but every other Saturday, be permitted to visit her brother at his home, ruled by Judge Sutton. However, the 1910 census indicates that both Virginia and her brother, Mathias were in their grandfather's custody.</li>
