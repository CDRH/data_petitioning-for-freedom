<p>
In the United States District Court, In and for the Western District
of Washington, Northern Division.

In the matter of the application of 
Ng Kwack Kang, for a Writ of 
Habeas Corpus.

No. 3157
Points and Authorities

This case not only involves the right of a child of a 
native born <add>Chinese</add> citizen to enter into the United States, but involves
the larger question of parentage. If the petitioner is the son of 
Ng Kum, then he is the heir of Ng Kum, and as such heir he is entitled 
to the right of inheritance, which, if the ruling of the
Secretary of Labor and Commerce shpuld be upheld, would, not only 
deprive the petitioner of the right of entry into the United States,
but would deprive the petitioner of the rights of succession and inheritance
as the heir of Ng Kum.

It is conceded upon a question of citizenship alone that a
decision of the Secretary of Labor and Commerce is final,
unless there appears to be an abuse of discretion. But the petitioner in 
this case contends that the decision of a ministerial officer as to
his parentage, is not final, and that he has a right to a judicial 
hearing, to determine the question of his parentage. The petitioner
seeks to review the findings of the Commissioner of Immigration, not
alone upon the question of citizenship and abuse of discretion, but
upon the question of his parentage, For your petitioner to be, by 
a ruling of a ministerial officer, unjustly deprived of the right 
of succession and inheritance, would be to deprive him of his property 
without due process of law.

The petitioner in this case seeks admission into the United 
States, not as an American born citizen of the United States, but as
the son of his father, which has been legally adjudged an American b
orn citizen. (See Exhibit B, Ng Kwack Kang) For the United States 
Government to take this young boy before executive officers, and
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
in what might be in every sense of the word, termed " a star chamber
proceeding"; without being confronted by witnesses, with no opportunity
for cross-examination, without the aid of counsel, and upon 
the unsworn and ex parte statements and conclusions of what appears
biased and prejudiced officials - to be by them, upon conjecture and 
doubt officially declared that he is not the son of his father, and
to deny him the right of entry into the United States, the opportunity
and advantaged of education, and last, but not least, the loving
care of his father, and to say that such a determination is final,
and that the applicant cannot have his parentage judicially determined
would be a monstrous and <add>an</add> iniquitious proceeding, contrary to 
all the rules of fair play.

Parentage has never been determined by ministerial officers
.. is not now determied by ministerial officers.. and will never
be finally determined by ministerial officers.

It will be noted from the examination of Ng Kum set forth
in "Exhibit B", November 17th, 1910, that Ng Kum gave the following
testimony:
Q. What are your names?
A. NG KUM, given name - NG HONG FAN, marriaqge name - no others.
Q. When were you married?
A. When I was twenty years old to Chin She, natural, 29
Back Wut Village, Sn, living now and since I married her
in Gong Ben Sn, China.
Q. Have you any children?
A. One son, NG KG Kwock Teun, 10, born 8/15, forgot year. No
daughters.
This testimony was given at a time when there could have 
been no motive for making a false statement.
At this point it might be well to consider the nativity 
of Ng Kum. In the record the following question appears to be 
propounded by the inspector:
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
Q. Is that your cert. of disch. and your photo thereon?
A. Yes. (indicating cert. of disch. in name of NG Kum, 
dated April 11, 1901, by Wm. V.S. Woodward, U.S. Comr.
No. Dist. of N.Y. On Cert. is also added "Release pursuant
to an Order of Honorable Alfred C. Coxe, U.S.
District Judge." Report of H.E. Owen, Assistant U.S. 
Attorney, dated November 15th 1910, and shows that
cert. is genuine and evidence forwarded by N.Y. inspector,
shows issue was nativity.)

Upon the completion of the testimony, the following note
appears:
Inspector's note: "From the completed record I am of the
opinion that the applicant's nativity is res adjudicata,
and he is therefore admitted.

(Exhibit "B" - case Ng Kwack Kang, Immigration Service Number 32828)

From the original record on appeal in case of NG <choice><sic>KWOCK</sic><corr>KWACK</corr></choice> KANG
File Number 54005/86, in the memorandum of the Acting Secretary, in
re APPEAL of NG <choice><sic>KWOCK</sic><corr>KWACK</corr></choice> KANG, aged 16, the following appears:
"1. Reason claimed as ground for admission:
That applicant is the son of a native.
2. Reason for exclusion at the port:
That alleged relationship has not been established.
3. Issue: Relationship.
4. Substance of record in support of admission:
Harmonious portions of record.
5. Substance of record opposed to admission:
Lack of satisfactory evidence of status of
alleged father and discrepancies indicating
doubt as to bona fides of claimed relationship.

Applicant applies for admission to Seattle as the son of
an American-born Chinese who resides <choice><sic>is</sic><corr>in</corr></choice> Boston. The identifying
witness lives in New York. This record, therefore, has been 
transmitted from Seattle to Boston and New York for examination
of the respective witnesses and, upon its return to Seattle,
the applicant was reexamined. As a result, there have been 
developed between his testimony and that of the other witnesses 
discrepancies of so material and positive a nature that there 
is serious doubt as to the bona fides of the relationship said
to exist between the alleged father and himself. The report
of the Acting Inspector in Charge at New York (pp26-29) also
raises the question of the competency of the evidence submitted
by the alleged father to establish his American nativity."

Q. Us the petitioner's status, parentage and relationship to 
be thus established by a ministerial officer upon doubt, conjecture
and surmise, if there exists <add>only</add> a doubt in the mind of this executive
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
officer as to the bona fides of the realtionship existing between
this petitioner and his father? Is this petitioner to be, not only 
deprived of the right of entry into the United States, but to be 
deprived of the right of succession and precluded from enjoying a 
father's loving care?
    If there exists a doubt, even if it be a serious doubt
as to the bona fides of the realtionship between this applicant and
his father, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the applicant, 
and not against him.
    The discrepeancies referred to are pointed out under the
captions "A", "B", "C", "D"  and "E". Considering the discrepancies 
pointed out under caption "D";

"The applicant and his alleged father disagreed concerning
the names and families of the occupants of most of the houses 
in their native village concerning whom they were questioned,
although they agree positively about their next door neighbors,
i.e., the families living to the right and left of them in
their row and opposite their house in the rows on either side.
This would indicate that they have prepared their testimony 
especially regarding their next door neighbors and had failed to 
do so concerning the other occupants of the village in China."

NG KUM was born in San Francisco, California, and not in 
China. The Honorable Secretary reasons that because the father and son 
agreed upon their next door neighbors that they were lying, and because 
they did not agree as to the names of the other families living 
in their native village, they were not father and son.

The discrepancies pointed out by the Immigration Official 
set forth in this memorandum, evidences an honest case rather than 
otherwise.

William C. Prout in his argument to the COmmissioner
General of Immigration, ably said:
"After making due allowance for the boy's youth and inexperience, 
and bearing in mind that being so young and so far 
from home in a country so strange in every detail, he udoubtedly 
was very much frightened and confused, so that in some things 
his testimony is not altogether correct. But, bearing these 
various reasons for confusion in mind, it must be admitted that 
the evidence given by him is substantially the same as that
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
given by his father. Of course, there are minor discrepancies, 
as there are bound to be in every case, but on the points which 
the boy could be reasonably expected to be clear his testimony 
leaves no room for criticism. A boy 17 years of age cannot
be expected to remember as clearly and testify as exactly as 
an adult, and a Chinese boy of that age is entiteld to a wider 
latitutde than would be an American boy.

As to family relations, family history and the various
intimate details of family life, the boy's testimony is precise
and apparently true. In some details he differs from the testimony
of his father, but upon further consideration it would 
appear that these details where they do not allow if a misunderstanding 
because of being a matter of opinion, the boy is 
correct. An example of this is  the conflict of the testimony of 
the father and son as to the burial place of NG GOON. The boy 
testified that he is buried in Mah Gee Hill in China. The 
father testified that he is not certain as to his burial place 
and so far as he knows he is buried in New York. The boy is
quite certain on this point and it is very likely that the Chinese 
Burial Society sent the bones of NG GOON to China for burial 
without the knowledge of NG KUM, the father.

The boy was probably warned or instructed before leaving
Chine not to give too much information and this probably explains
his statements that so far as he knew and the inhabitants of the
Hong Hing village were all members of the NG family, while the
father testifies that they included members of the MOY, CHUEY,
LEE. CHIN and NG families. This discrepancy evidences an honest
case rather than otherwise, since on such a simple and important 
matter the father and son would be in accord if the case were 
a dishonest one, and one which had been prepared in advance.

There are other matters of lesser importance in the testimony
upon which the boy and his father do not agree, but these 
are matters which rest almost altogether in the memory of the 
witness and consequently a difference between their testimony 
can readily be accounted for. They both agree that there are
ten or eleven rows in the village; that there are from twenty 
to thirty houses in the village, the boy describes the ownership
of the various houses correctly and describes the village
correctly, or at least the testimony of father and son on these
points is in accord in the more important particulars. The
HONG PING, his own village, in the village hall. The father 
gives as a reason that the boy did not attend school in HONG PING
that the school building was decayed. It is entirely possible 
that the boy did attend school for a time in HONG MEE, that 
village being but from a quarter to a half mile distant from
HONG PING, but it is entirely possible and on the evidence seems
to be the case, that the village hall in HONG PING had been repaired
and possible enlarged, as the boy and father both give 
the same location for the school house in HONG PING.

The father talks of a village known as SHEK KOW WAI, and
the boy appears to be unfamiliar with this village. This would
seem to be hard to explain, since SHEK KOW WAI is supposed to
between HONG PING and HONG MEE, but the father testified that it 
is "practically" between HONG PING and HONG MEE, thus making it
likely that it sets out to one side and it is also quite probable
that the boy knew the village under some other name.
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
The only other discrepancy in the testimony that amounts
to anything is the testimony as to the physical condition of 
applicant's paternal grandmother. The father testified that
his mother was humpbacked and the boy in the first instance
testified that she had physical defects, but then stated 
that he understood the question to refer to his own mother
instead of his father's mother. Even though this were true, 
this is not at all serious since in our language the word
humpbacked is frequently used to denote the stoop which comes
with old age and the witness might have used this word intending 
to mean that rather than any congenital defect.

Appended to this appeal is a drawing of the town of HONG
PING, made by NG KUM, the applicant's father. If the Honorable 
Commissioner General remains in doubt as to the relationship
of applicant to NG KUM, applicant respectfully suggests that 
he be given a chance to make a similar drawing, or to fill in a 
blank duplicate of the same, in order that it may be compared 
with this original.

From the reasons for denying the application given, it
does not appear that the American citizenship of the father is
in question, since the finding does not specifically so state,
therefore applicant has not touched upon this phase of the 
case in this appeal, and from the record in the case it appears
that the father has been duly adjudicated an American citizen
by a court of competent jurisdiction, behind whose verdict no
inquiry can be made in this proceeding."

Immigration officers cannot act arbitrarily in refusing 
to believe persons sought to be deported, or his witnesses.
U.S. vs Lee Chung, 206 Fed. 367;
In re, Gin Wong Lee, 91 Fed. 240;
Wong Chung vs. U.S., 179 Fed. 182;
94 C .C.A., 198;
U.S. vs Leung S an, et al, 144 Fed. 72.

The burden of proof is on the Immigration officials.
U.S. ex rel, Castro vs. Williams, 203 Fed. 155.
It is not sufficient to raise a doubt. 
U.S. vs. Hong Lin, 214 Fed. 456.
One cannot be deported on insufficient or illegal evidence,
ex parte, Yah Ucaina, 199 Fed. 885.

In determining whether aliens are entitled to admission, 
the Immigration authorities act in an administrative and not a judicial 
capacity, and must follow definite standards, and apply general rules.
U.S. vs. Uhl, 203 Fed., 152.
Congress has seen fit to base the final decision as to the 
rights of aliens to enter the country in the Department of Commerce
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
and Labor, but that Department is governed by certain rules and regulations,
which must be strictly construed in conformity with the
eternal principles of justice and right.

It is fundamental in American jurisprudence that every
person is entitled to a fair trial by an impartial tribunal.
U.S. vs. Redfern, 180 Fed. 500;
In the case of U.S. vs. Williams, 185 Fed., 598, 599, District 
Judge Holt, after stating the usual procedure in deportation proceedings, says:

"It is, of course, obvious that such a method of procedure 
disregards almost every fundamental principle established in
England and this contry for the protection of persons charged
with an offense. The person arrested does not necessarily know 
who instigated the prosecution. He is held in seclusion, and is 
not permitted to consult counseel until he has been privately
examined under oath. The whole proceeding is usually substantially 
in control of one of the inspectors, who acts in it as informer, 
arresting officer, inquisitor, and judge. The Secretary who issues 
the Order of arrest and the Order of deportation is an administrative 
officer who sits hundreds of miles away, and never hears or 
sees the person proceeded against or the witnesses. Aliens, if
arrested, are at least entitled to the rights which such a system
accords them; and, if they are deprived of <choice><sic>anu</sic><corr>any</corr></choice> such right, the
proceeding is clearly irregular, and any order of deportation
issued is invalid."

The petitioner's full rights, provided for in relation 
to the Chinese Exclusion Law, have been violated. He was denied the
right to have his appeal heard and determined by the Secretary of 
Labor and Commerce, as provided by law. W.B. Wilson is the Secretary
of Labor, and Louis Post is his only Assistant Secretary of Labor.
The petitioner appealed to the Secretary of Labor from the decision
denying him the right to enter and remain in the United States. The 
applicant's appeal, under the law, should have been heard by the
Secretary of Labor, unless he was unable to act, then his Assistant 
Secretary should have heard and determined the matter. The applicant's
appeal was heard and determined, not by the Secretary of Labor, but
the appeal and the Order affirming the findings of the Commissioner 
of Immigration of Seattle was heard, determined and approved by one,
Alfred Hampton, without designing any name or authority vested in
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
Albert Hampton, or that the Secretary of Labor was absent, or unable 
to act. The findings were approved only by Louis Post, Assistant 
Secretaru, page 31 of the Treaty Law and Rules governing the Admission
of Chinese, approved January 24th, 1914, it is provided:

"That every case where an alien is excluded from admission 
into the United States under any law or treaty now existing 
or hereafter made, the decision of the appropriate Immigration
Officials, if adverse to the admission of such alien,
shall be final, unless reversed on appeal to the Secretary 
Of Labor."

Applicant appeaked to the Secretary of Labor, and under
the law had a right to have his appeal determined by the Secretary
of Labor. The findings and judgement of Alfred Hampton, approved
by Louis Post, the Assistant Secretary of Labor, was not in strict
compliance with the law. Suppose in a proceeding like the case at
bar, the matter should be referred to the Court Commissioner for determination.
It might be that the Court Commissioner was perfectly 
capable to pass on the issues involved, but if he were to do so, 
and the Judge should approve his findings, no one would question 
the illegality of the proceeding. The methods of procedure in 
immigration matters disregard almost every fundamental principle of 
law. The person arrested does not necessarily know who instigated
the prosecution. He is held in seclusion, and is not permitted to
consult counsel until he is privately examined under oath. The 
whole proceeding is usually substantially controlled by one of the 
inspectors, who acts as informer, arresting officer, inquisitor 
and judge. The Secretary who issues the Order of arrest, and the 
Order of deportation is an administrative officer who sits undereds
of miles away, and never heards or sees the person proceeded against, 
or the witnesses. Aliens, if arrested, are entitled to the rights 
which such a system accords them, and if they are deprived of any 
such right, the proceeding is clearly irregular, and any Order of 
Deportation issued is invalid.
