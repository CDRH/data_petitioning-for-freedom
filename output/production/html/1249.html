    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Alma Oharra was born to Mary J. Harmon and her husband in 1884. At some point she was committed to the House of the Good Shepherd, a home for "delinquent girls" in Omaha, as well as a convent. Her mother filed a writ of habeus corpus for her daughter on January 24, 1918, when Alma was 34. Mary did not share a surname with her daughter because at some point before the filing of the writ, her marriage with Alma's father dissolved. The writ of habeus corpus, set to be executed "forthwith," was directed at the Mother Superior, Sister M. Raphael Moran. (This is her religious name, not the one she was born with, as it is stated multiple times throughout the case that her real name remains unknown.) The writ was approved by judge Willis S. Sears, and Alma appeared before Judge George S. Day in the Douglas County District Court, but the result of the case is unknown. However, 1930 census records indicate that an Alma O'Hara, born the same year as the Alma Oharra mentioned in this case, was still an "inmate" at the House of the Good Shepherd in Omaha, indicating that Harmon was unsuccessful in reclaiming her daughter.</li>
