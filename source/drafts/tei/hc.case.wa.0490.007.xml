United States District Court 
Western District of Washington 
Northern Division.

In the Matter of the
Application of Ng Kwack Kang
For a Writ of Habeas Corpus

No. 3157
Filed January 14, 1916

Beeler and Sullivan,
For Petitioner

Clay Allen, U.S. Attorney
Albert Moodie, Asst. U.S. Atty. } For Government.

Neterer, District Judge:
The petitioner applied for admission to the United States
as the son of an American born Chinaman. His application was
denied by the Commissioner of immigration, an appeal was prosecuted
to the Secretary of Labor, the Commissioner affirmed, and
a warrant of deportation issued. Petition for writ of habeas
corpus was made, in which he charges, First, that he was not accorded
a fair hearing, in that he was denied the right of counsel,
and the evidence adduced at the preliminary examination was wrongfully
and unlawfully used against him at the hearing after arrest; 
Second, that there is no evidence in the record to support the
findings of the Immigration officers, and that the decision of
the Department of Labor is arbitrary and should be set aside,
and Third, that the applicant is entitled to have his appeal 
heard and determined by the Secretary of Labor. and that the 
record discloses that it was heard and determined solely by one
Alfred Hampton, and approved by Louis F. Post, Assistant Secretaty
of Labor.

An examination of the entire record shows that the petitioner
was accorded a fair trial. While an alien cannot clam the constitutional
rights guaranteed to a citizen, he has rights which, under
treaty stipulations and the law, must be respected. None of the
treaty rights nor provisions of the law applicable to this case
appear to have been violated. The examination of an alien for 
admission is necessarily summary and informal. The record shows
</p>

<p>
that no opportunity was denied the applicant to produce testimony
and all witnesses sought were examined. There is nothing
in the record to show that the right of counsel was denied. The
fact that counsel was not present or was not given opportunity 
to cross-examine the witnesses did not deprive him of a right,
Ex parte Chin Quack Wah, 22 Fed. 138; U.S. v. Williams, 190 Fed. 898

"If the petitioner was not denied a fair opportunity
to produce the evidence he desires or a fair, though 
summary, hearing, the case can proceed no further."
