lawful age being duly sworn on oath states:
That he has read the affidavit of Ray Raymond
for a change of venue in the case of Territory
of Washington vs. Ray Raymond; that he has no
acquaintance with the defendant, has never spoken
to her, never been in her house, nor on her
pressures, nor in her company; neither has he
ever held any communication with her in any
way; that the statement in said affidavit on page 3 allocated
to applicant is wholly false and without any foundation
whatever; that applicant never made the statements therein
contained to anyone, and never made any statement
anything like it, or which could possibly be so
continued. Applicant further states that he was not
employed by citizen of Spokane Falls to present
defendant, neither did he volunteer so to do
but he was restrained by the prosecuting 
attorney for and on behalf of the Territory
which was all well known to defendant's
attorney who prepared her affidavit and
who as applicant believes instigated her to
swear to the statements relating to applicant.
Affidavit further states that he knows of
no excitement or prejudice in Spokane County
which would present defendant having 
a fair trial in said County, but on the
contrary that said Defendant has many
friends in said county and in Spokane 
Falls and affidavit believes that she sac
have a fair, enprejudiced and impartial
trial in said County. Geo M. Forster
