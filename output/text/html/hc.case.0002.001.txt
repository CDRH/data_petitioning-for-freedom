vs.
Mrs Whiteside defendants

Before Hon J.E. Wyche
Judge of the 1st Judicial 
District WT at 
Chambers

Andrew H Derrick Plff in this
application shows to his honor 
Judge aforesaid that he is the 
father of Louisa Jane Derrick a 
young girl of the age of fourteen
years that his said girl is now 
and has been for some time past at the house of 
Mrs Whiteside whose christian 
name is unknown to Plff but 
whose house and residence is 
in Walla Walla city Washington 
Territory. That Plff has often requested
his said daughter to leave said place 
and go with him to some good 
respectable place to live and that 
as Plff is informed the defendant. 
advises his said child to disobey his 
commands that before said child 
went to Defts house she was a good 
obedient child and very moral



and a member of a christian 
church obeying the commands 
of the bible that his said girl
was taken to said place without
his knowledge or consent that 
since said child has been at 
said place she has as Plff is informed and believes been taught 
by the defendant to renounce her 
religion to despise all christians 
to disobey her father this Plff and 
her    to hate
all her kin to go to balls and 
dance to mingle and associate 
with people of bad reputation and 
that Defendant hold such power 
over said child that she is 
restrained from going with Plff
that persons at Defts house whom 
Plffs was urging said child to 
leave said place and go to a 
good place provided by him
for her treatment to 
Plaintiff if he did not desist
from his efforts and that Deft
did not reprove said person
but took said child into a 
private apartment where Plff could
not approach her there defying



Plffs authority over said child
as her father that plff has by his 
sister and the aunt of said child 
endeavored to get said child from 
said place but were treated with 
great contempt and harshness
Plff further shows  that he is 
fearful that if he should attempt
to force said child away from 
said place that persons in the 
interest of Deft would maltreat
and injure Plff    Plff further shares 
tht Plff is a moral man of good
industrious habits and has always 
provided a good home and the 
comforts of life to the best of his 
ability for said child and that 
when she went to the house of 
Defendant she had been living at 
the house of a good and respectable 
farmer of good moral repute
that Plff is now anxious to have 
his said child at school and 
her moral truancy attended to 
that he is informed and verily
believes that unless his honor
awards his said child to him she 
will soon be ruined in character
and minds and prays that a 



writ of Habeas corpus be forth
with issued and bring said
child before his honor of J E Wyche 
Jude of said Judicial Disctrict
to be disposed of as the law requires
