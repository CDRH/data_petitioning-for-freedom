    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Joseph Walton petitioned for habeas corpus against Sheriff L. C. Smith on January 10, 1906. Walton had been arrested for the crime of "Barbering on Sunday" after he shaved a guest in the Tourist Hotel. His petition argued that the charged action was not illegal, that the law that he was charged under violated the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees to equal protection and due process, and that the Justice of the Peace had no jurisdiction to issue an arrest warrant. Judge Cornelius H. Hanford ordered that Smith show cause for Walton's detention. Hanford stated on February 9 that the State Supreme Court had decided that the statute was not unconstitutional and stated that a Sunday observance law was not considered invidious discrimination under the Supreme Court case Petit v. Minnesota. Hanford remanded Walton to the custody of Lewis and stated that Walton could appeal to the Supreme Court. In an order from November 20, 1909, Hanford stated that Walton could receive his recognizance by surrendering himself to the custody of the United States Marshal to be remanded to the custody of Lewis, which suggests that Walton was released at some point. </li>
