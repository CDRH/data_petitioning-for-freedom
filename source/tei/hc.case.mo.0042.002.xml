<p>To the Hon Judge of the Law Commissioners 
Court within &amp; for the County of St Louis.</p>

<p>The undersigned respectfully requests 
that a writ of Habeas Corpus may be issued 
by your Honor, to bring before you the 
person of one Miles Guba, a negro man 
now unlawfully (as the undersigned believes) 
detained &amp; confined by the Sheriff of the said 
County, within the county Jail situated 
in said Co of St Louis</p>

<p>The said Miles was committed to said jail 
in the month of <del>January</del> March AD 1857 &amp; has there 
been confined ever since, on the pretence 
that he is a runaway slave</p>

<p>The circumstances under which he was 
arrested and committed are as follows-</p>

<p>In January 1857 sd Miles got on board 
a steamboat at Cairo, Illinois for the 
purpose of coming up river, that on the 
way up the clerk of the boat asked him for 
his fare &amp; he told sd clerk that he had not 
any money, that the Clerk then asked him 
if he had free papers &amp; he told him no, but 
that he was &amp; always had been a free man</p>

<p>That in the arrival of the boat at St Louis 
the Clerk of the boat took him up to the said 
jail &amp; then he was put into sd jail by Lewis 
Musick, the Deputy keeper thereof &amp; has ever 
since been there confined.</p>

<p>The says that the arrest &amp; confinement 
of sd Miles is unlawful for these reasons</p>


<p>1 That the Sheriff of sd County claims to hold 
him under the provisions of Chapter 150 
of the Revised Statues of Missouri &amp; that 
the provisions of that chapter relate wholly 
to slaves whose masters are residents 
of the State of Missouri &amp; that the facts of 
this case rebut <del>the</del> any presumption 
that said Miles is a slave, is owned by 
any citizen of Missouri</p>

<p>2 That said Sheriff has never published 
the notices required by said Statute in case 
of the arrest of a runaway slave, though 
the time has long since elapsed in which 
such notices should have been given</p>

<p>3 That a fugitive slave, whose owner 
resides in another state than Mo, can 
only be arrested under the provisions 
of Chapt 70 of the Revised Statute of Mo, or 
the laws of the United States in such 
use, made &amp; provided &amp; the said Miles 
was not arrested or confined according 
to the provisions of said laws</p>

<p>4 That all prescriptions of law are in favor 
of freedom &amp; that in the statute such presumptions are <del> only if </del> required to be rebutted 
by some facts that tend to show that the 
negro has been held &amp; claimed as a slave, 
before he can be required to prove 
<del>that</del> he is a freeman <del>in order to</del> that 
in this case there are no such facts</p>


<p>The undersigned says he has made application 
to Jail <del>Lewis</del> Musick, the Deputy Jailor (in whose 
custody are the records of commitments to sd jail) 
for a copy of the order upon which said Miles 
was committed to Jail, that said Musick 
has declined &amp; refused to let him have a 
copy, or <unclear>exhibit</unclear> to him the original.</p>

<p>No application to the knowledge or belief 
of the undersigned <del>has</del> for the relief sought 
for by this petition has been made to &amp; refused 
by any Court, officer or officers, superior 
to the Hon Court to whom this petition 
is presented</p>
<p><unclear>Geo D Bann Jr</unclear></p>

<p>Duly Sworn before 
me on this 13th day of 
October 1858</p>
<p>H Dusenbury</p>
<p>Law Comn</p>
