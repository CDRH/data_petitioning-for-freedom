    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Same story as Edward Crofery's in 0444. They were partners. This is 0444's summary modified:

A telegram was received by Chief of Police (Butterfield) from Vancouver's Chief of Police asking him to arrest Edward Crofery and Howard McMillan for stealing jewelry. Chief did so. Attorney filed for petition of Habeas Corpus on the grounds that there was no illegality on file by any court in the Territory. Writ was granted. The same day, they realized the U. S. Marshall already came with a warrant from U.S. Commissioners Court saying they smuggled goods into the U.S.(stated in 0444). Crofery and McMillen were no longer in custody and couldn't be produced to the court so writ was discharged.</li>
