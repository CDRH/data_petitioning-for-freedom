    <li>Summary of Proceedings: William Denny petitioned that his 6 year old daughter was held unlawfully by the St. James Orphanage and that he was not allowed to visit or see his daughter without any just or lawful reason. May Denny, her mother, placed her there. On April 4th, the court decided to not make a decision about if the parents are fit enough to keep her at that time and instead decided that Ruby should remain in the custody of the asylum and that the parents could visit. The court also ordered that the parents had to each pay half of what it costed to keep their child in the asylum, including board, keep and clothing. Additionally, it was decided that temporary custody of Ruby be given to the orphanage until removed by the mutual consent of the parents or action of the court.</li>
