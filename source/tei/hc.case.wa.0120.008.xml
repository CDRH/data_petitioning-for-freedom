return to the same State as follows,
First, that I am now and during
all the time for the two years past
have been Sheriff of Columbia County
Washington Territory and the Keeper
of the common jail of said County,
that on the 18th day of April 1884
the County of Garfield in said
Territory had no jail or other place
for the safe keeping of prisoners and
that said County of Garfield has at no
time since had such jail or place,
that on the 18th day of April 1884 the
Honorable S.C. Wingard Judge of
the District Court of Garfield County
Washington Territory holding terms
at Pomeroy in said County made
an order, that all persons bound
over to wait trial before the District
Court in said County of Garfield and who are unable to furnish
bonds be confined in the County jail
of said Columbia County, A true copy
of which order is hereby annexed and

<pb/>

marked "A" and made a part of this
return, that on the 13th day of February
1886 L.T. Savacool was brought before
W.S. Newland, one of the Justices of
the Peace in and for said County of Garfield
charged on the oath of C.A. McCabe and
Jas Robinson with having on the
8th day of February 1886, in said County
committed the offence of uttering and
publishing a forgery and in having
appeared to the said W.S. Newland Justice
of the Peace as aforesaid on the examination of the said L.T. Savacool then
and there by him made that the said
offence or crime had been committed
and that there was probable cause to believe
the said L.T. Savacool guility thereof,
ordered that the said L.T. Savacool
enter into recognizance in the sum of
One Thousand Dollars for his appearance
to answer at the next term of said
District Court, and that in default
of said recognizance that he be committed
to jail until he should be thence
discharged by due process of Law,
that the said L.T. Savacool failed to
enter into said recognizance whereupon

<pb/>

the said Justice of the Peace issued
his commitment in due form of law
(a true copy of which is hereinto annexed marked "B" and made a part
of this return) and delivered the
same to W.E. Wilson, Sheriff of said
County of Garfield who by virtue of
said commitment on the 13th day
of February 1886, delivered the said
L.T. Savacool into my custody in
said jail, since which time
and for the causes aforesaid I have as
said keeper of said jail imprisoned
and detained the said L.T. Savacool in my
custody in said jail,</p>
