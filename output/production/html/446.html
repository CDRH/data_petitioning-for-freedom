    <li>Summary of Proceedings: McLane was convicted of the crime of vagrancy and charged with a ten dollar fine. The witness, D. L. McCowan, said that McLane was a healthy man who could work but lived an idle life that consisted of wandering around the streets and having an unnamed woman support him. McLane defaulted on his payment and was therefore ordered to hard labor until the fine was paid or ten days had passed. The petitioner&#x2019;s attorneys, Kalloch, Murphy, and Holcomb, argued that the detention was illegal because Seattle territory law had recently changed and did not give the justice of the peace authority to detain him. Therefore, the detention was illegal under the US constitution. Judge Greene issued the writ of Habeas Corpus on this basis. </li>
