<p> The State of Missouri </p>
<p> To the Keeper of the Common Jail of St Louis 
County Greeting: </p>

<p> Whereas complaint has been made be-
fore me that one Henry Freeman 
a Negro is a Runaway Slave as 
set forth in the complaint of Alfred 
B Holton. There are therefore to 
command you to receive the body 
of the said Henry Freeman in to 
your common Jail and him 
safely keep until he be taken hence 
by his master and all reasonable char-
ges paid, or until he be otherwise dis-
charged according to Law. </p>

<p> Given under my hand this 20th day of July 1855 </p>
<p> Peter W Johnstown </p>
<p> Justice </p>
