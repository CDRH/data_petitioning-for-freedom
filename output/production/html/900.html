    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On December 18, 1923, the governor of Nebraska issued a warrant for the arrest of Nettie Goodwin and George Armstrong on the charges of adultery and being fugitives from justice. This was based on a request from the governor of Iowa, N.E. Kendall, where the accused were from. Interestingly, the writ was directed both at the deputy sheriff of Woodbury County, Iowa, Frank Jibb,  and his wife. The couple were soon arrested and were confined by Douglas County sheriff Michael L. Endres, Frank Jibb, and an unknown man, called John Doe in court papers. They filed a petition for a writ of habeus corpus on December 20, 1923, claiming that they were being confined unlawfully since their arrest wasn't based on an affidavit or indictment from a magistrate, they weren't charged with a crime in the warrant for their arrest, there was no date specified for when this adultery was committed, and they had not left Iowa to escape prosecution. Interestingly, Goodwin and Armstrong believed that they were being confined based on a warrant from Iowa, not Douglas County. In turn, the defendants presented the warrant from the governor and said that John Doe didn't exist and there was no third man confining the couple. On December 21, 1923, an answer and return to the writ was issued and the case was continued until further order. At a hearing on Christmas Eve 1923, the application was granted and the relators were ordered released from custody.</li>
