    <li>Summary of Proceedings: The 27-year-old John L. Allsman had married the 14-year old Hazel Smith in Council Bluffs, Iowa on July 15, 1913. Hazel's mother, Tessie Smith, had managed to catch the couple in Omaha as they were about to leave by train. Allsman was charged with child stealingand Hazel was taken back to her parents' home. On July 25, 1913, Allsman petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge Hazel's detention by her parents, which was granted. While her hearing was pending, Hazel, who was a minor, was placed into the custody of Emily Hornberger, the county probation officer. Jesse Strode, the Lancaster County attorney, successfully motioned to have himself added to the case as a "party defendant on behalf of the State of Nebraska." After hearing the evidence, Allsman's writ was allowed and Hazel was released from the custody of her family. The couple went on to settle in Omaha and have 9 children.</li>
