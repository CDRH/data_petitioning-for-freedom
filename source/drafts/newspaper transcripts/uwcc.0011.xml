Civil Rights for the Celestials.

Senator Stewart, of Nevada, has prepared a bill to be introduced in the Senate providing for giving to Chinamen the civil rights of citizens of the United States. We do not believe that the Congress will, under present circumstances, be willing to pass such a measure. It is a well known fact that the Celestials who have emigrated to this country do not ask for anything but what is already accorded to them, except to be put upon an equality with American citizens in the courts of law, and that they may be protected in their persons and property. They do not come to this country to become citizens, but always look forward to, and arrange for, a return to the "Flowery Kingdom" during their natural life, or in the event of death, that their bones be taken back to their sacred soil of China, this is scrupulously and sacredly performed in every instance where it is practicable to do so, as every citizen residing on the Pacific slope will affirm.

Commissioner Delano, of the Internal Revenue Bureau, has instructed the supervisor in the distilling districts throughout the country to change the guagers in their respective districts, once in every three or four weeks, in order to have the law properly enforced, to make honest the rule rather than the exception in the whole Revenue Department.
