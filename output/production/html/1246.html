    <li>Summary of Proceedings: McDonough reapplied for petition alongside attorney Richard Osborn, claiming convicted imprisonment to be "an act of passion and prejudice" by Soderberg. In a docket entry it's revealed a Georgia Willimsin charged McDonough of threatening to burn down Willimson's dwelling house, to which McDonough plead not guilty and was charged with a bail sum of $1500, which was claimed to be excessively unjust and oppressive. Soderberg is accused through the reapplication to have criminal proceedings against him as a result and should no longer be allowed to act as Justice of the Peace, thus losing all jurisdiction over the petitioner. And it's also claimed that McDonough was not mentally or physically fit to be guilty of the charges made against her. Thus McDonough wasn't given a proper trial or hearing and was later discharged from custody.</li>
