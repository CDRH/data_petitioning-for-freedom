<p>United States of America</p>
<p>Western District of Washington</p>
<p>Northern Division</p>

<p>ss.</p>

<p>George H. L. Murray being first duly sworn, on his oath deposes and says:</p>

<p>That he makes this complaint for the purpose of procuring the extradition from the Northern Division of the Western District of Washington to the Province of Saskatchewan in the Dominion of Canada, one of the Provinces of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, ruled by His Majesty, George the V, its king, of one FLETCHER DECKER, pursuant to the terms of Sas. 5270 of the Revied Statutes of the United States, as <unclear>amended</unclear> by an act of Congress approved June 6, 1900, entitled An Act amending action 5270 of the Revised Statutes of the United States," and the extradition convention between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, proclaimed by the Precident of the United States on the 25th day of March, 1890, supplementary to the Tenth Article of the Treaty concluded between the same high contracting parties on the 9th day of August, <unclear>1813</unclear>.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that in the Province of Saskatchewan aforesaid, in the Dominion of Canada aforesaid, on the 15th day of November, A. D. 1915, near Wiwa Hill Post Office in said Province, he, the said Fletcher Decker, then and there being, did then and there take, steal and carry away about three hundred (300) bushals of flax, the property of one Claude Ficklin, of the value of Four Hundred Seventy-five Dollars ($475.00), with the intent then and there to commit an indictable offence, to-wit, the crime of theft, contrary to the Criminal <unclear>Code</unclear> of Canada.</p>

<pb/>

<p>Affiant further says, that at the time aforesaid, to-wit, on the 15th day of November, A. D. 1915, it was and now is provided by the said Criminal Code of Canada in and by Sec. 347 of said Criminal Code of Canada, the same then and now being in force in said Province of Saskatchewan, and in the Dominion of Canada aforesaid, as follows, to-wit: That</p>

<p>"347. Theft or stealing is the act of fraudulently and without colour of right taking, or fraudulently and without colour of right converting to the use of any person, anything capable of being stolen, with intent,-</p>

<p>(a) to deprive the owner, or any person having any special property or interest therein, temporarily or absolutely of such thing or of such property or interest; or,</p>

<p>(b) to pledge the same or deposit it as security; or,</p>

<p>(c) to part with it under a condition as to its return which the person parting with it may be unable to perform; or,</p>

<p>(d) to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time of such taking and conversion.</p>

<p>2. Theft is committed when the offender moves the thing or causes it to move or to be moved, or begins to cause it to become movable, with intent to steal it.</p>

<p>3. The taking or converstion may be fraudulent, although effected without secrecy or attempt at concealment.</p>

<p>4. It is immaterial whether the thing converted was taken for the purpose of conversion, or whether it was, at the time of the conversion, in the lawful possession of the person converting."</p>

<p>Affiant further says, that by the law of said Dominion of Canada now in force and in force on said 15th day of November, A. D. 1915, it is provided that the offence of theft and the offence of stealing are indictable offences in and by section 335 of the said Criminal Code of Canada.</p>

<pb/>

<p>Affiant further says, that by the law of said Dominion of Canada now in force and in force on said 15th day of November, A. D. 1915, it is provided in and by section 683 of the said Criminal Code of the Dominion of Canada, as follows:</p>

<p>"683. Every justice holding a preliminary inquiry shall cause the depositions to be written in a legible hand and on one side only of each sheet of paper on which they are written: Provided that the evidence upon such inquiry or any part of the same may be taken in shorthand by a stenographer who may be appointed by the justice and who before acting shall, unless he is a duly sworn official court stenographer, make oath that he shall truly and faithfully report the evidence.</p>

<p>2. Where evidence is so taken, it shall not be necessary that such evidence be read over to or signed by the witness, but it shall be sufficient if the transcripts be signed by the justice and be accompanied by an affidavit of the stenographer, or if the stenographer is a duly sworn court stenographer by the stenographer's certificate that it is a true report of the evidence."</p>

<p>Affiant further says that on the 14th day of June, A. D. 1921, at Regina in said Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada aforesaid, one Thomas Walter Chard, of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, made oath in writing before one A. J. G.
