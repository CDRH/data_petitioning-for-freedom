Testimony of TJ Perkins

Yesterday morning John Dugan came to our  store &amp; said Mary Teller had killed Frank
meaning Franklin Teller I then with Mr Neil went out to Mr Tellers house and saw him
lying between the house and gate dead there was a double barrel shot gun lying about
five feet from him cocked and capped with new caps I also saw a board about one inch
by four and about four feet long with blood on it 

I dont think he could of fallen with the gun in his hands without discharging it
