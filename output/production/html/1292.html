    <li>Summary of Proceedings:  On February 8th, 1919, Dollie Dean was arrested and charged with vagrancy, prostitution, and with being an inmate of a common and ill-governed house. On February 10th, Dollie was found guilty of these charges and sentenced to 90 days in the county jail. She appealed this ruling. After she furnished a $400 bond, the magistrate issued her release. Dollie alleged that the Keeper of the Jail and the Chief of Police refused to release her and that she had since been detained without cause. It was on these grounds that she petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. On February 15th, the writ was granted and Dollie was released.</li>
