of one of the classes of aliens required to be deported under
the laws of the United States, as outlined by the said Act as
amended March 26th, 1910, and specifically denies that she was

the purported examination had been held that she was informed
of her right to be represented by an attorney. Petitioner futher
denies that the said Thomas M. Fisher, and other members 
of the Department of Commerce and Labor stationed at Seattle,
Washington, endeavored to induce Roger Marchetti to present any
other or further evidence which he mightthave touching the matter of 
said deportatioon, and denies further that A.T. White, 
Inspector of said Bureau, personally delievered to said Roger
Marchetti a letter notifying him that further proceedings would
be had on March 7th, 1913, at the Detention House in Seattle,
Washington, and that <span class="tei_add">at</span> the close of said examination the record

Inspector that he could not take the matter up on March 7th, 
1913, but would take it up the next morning without fail. Petitioner
admits that the said Roger Marchetti did not appear in
said proceeding or produce or make any effort to produce any
other or further evidence, but specifically denies that she, the
said Marie or Mary Miler, at any time did not offer to produce
or procure any other or further evidence, but specfically alleges
that she has been ready and willing at all times to procure
further evidence to controvert the evidence introduced 
against her in this proceeding, but has been prevented from so
doing. Petitioner further denies that by reason of the premises
as set forth in Commissioner Ellis DeBruller's answer and return 
to the writ and petition herein on file, that this Court has no
jurisdiction to review the Acts of the Secretary of Commerce
and Labor, or the Acts of the Secretary of Labor who now has
charge of said matter, and therefore prays in accordance with
her petition herein now on file, and that your petitoner may
be restored to her liberty.</p>
