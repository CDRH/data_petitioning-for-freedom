    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Charles Jackson filed a writ of Habeas Corpus because he was being held against his will by the US Secretary of Labor, Henry White. Jackson allegedly entered the United States in June 1917 and was arrested in January 1918 under the authority of White due to suspicion that he was an illegal alien from Denmark who changed his name from Peterson to Jackson so that he could get a job in the mines. The petitioner argued that there was no evidence supporting his arrest, but Henry White produced evidence that showed cause for his arrest. The writ was denied and Charles Jackson stayed in detention.</li>
