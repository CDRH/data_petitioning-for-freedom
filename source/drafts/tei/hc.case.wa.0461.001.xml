No. 1
To the Honorable Circuit Court of the United States
for the District of Washington:

Ex parte M.L. Coovert
Your petitioner M.L. Coovert
complains and shows to the court as follows:
That he is a citizen and resident of the State of Washington, and that he is unjustly 
and unlawfully detailed and imprisoned by George <unclear>Nerton</unclear>
by the order of and upon a warrant issues by the Honorable E. A. Wiswall, sitting and 
acting as judge of the Superior Court of the State of Washington for the County of 
Clarke, a copy of which warrant is hereto attached marked "Exhibit No. 1," and which your
petitioner prays may be considered as a part of this petition, the same as if it was
expressly incorporated in it. And he ever since has been kept in confinement and
under arrest, and now is under arrest as aforesaid and restrained of his liberty upon the
following charged: Violation of the following law of the State of Washington:

"Section 1. That it shall be unlawful for any person or persons whatever to manufacture, 
buy, sell, give, or furnish to any one cigarettes, cigarette paper, or cigarette 
wrapper.
"Sec. 2. That whosoever manufactures, buys, sells, gives or furnishes to any person
or persons cigarettes, cigarette paper or cigarette wrapper shall be feemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned 
in jail not exceeding six months, or both, for each offense.
"Sec. 3 This act shall be liberally construed to the end that its object shall be
enforced.
"Sec. 4. All laws or parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of this act are
hereby repealed."
And upon the <del>information</del><add>affidavit</add> of which a copy is hereto attached, and marked as
"Exhibit No. 2," and which your petitioner expressly makes a part of this petition, the 
same as if incorporated in it, and prays that it may be so considered.
And that immediately upon the arrest of your petitioner, he was taken before the said
Honorable E.A. Wiswall, sitting and acting as judge of the Superior Court as aforesaid, 
and as a committing magistrate. That before said magistrate testimony was given by
C. L. MacDonald and G. A. Stapleton
as follows: that your petitioner had sold to C. L. MacDonald
a package of cigarettes, marked "Vanity Fair"
being ten paper-wrapped cigarettes, enclosed in a pasteboard
slide box having upon it the name
of the manufacturer _ Brand of Cigarettes
number of Manufacturing District and State
and number of cigarettes.
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
with the caution notice required by the laws of the United States printed on the side of 
said Coy, and the United States internal revenue stamp for ten cigarettes pasted 
across the end of said box so as to act as a seal.
And the said package so sold by your petitioner was produced before the committing 
magistrate as evidence, and is herewith produced as "Exhibit No. 3" of this petition.

The aforesaid facts your petitioner admits to be true. The said cigarettes were
sold in Oregon
to your petitioner by the American Tobacco Company, doing business in the state of
New York
and said cigarettes were manufactured in New York, and were <add>not</add>
shipped to your petitioner in pasteboard bozed, containing similar 
<del>such</del> packages, <del>exactly similar</del> to said "Exhibit 3." <del>That said pasteboard boxes are
called "cartons" by the trade, and are used simply for the purpose of making convenient
parcels of the packages of cigarettes for enumeration and handling at the factory, and to
protect the cigarette packages when in storage, and one of such "cartons" is herewith
produced as "Exhibit No. 4" of this petition, and is more particularly described as follows:</del>
