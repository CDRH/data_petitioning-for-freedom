A. Yes, sir.
Q. Well, then, how did you come to have any conversation about the death of Anna Edna?

Q. What did he say?
A. First he told me to step up close ot the bar, and then he said he wanted to tell me about it, and I told him that I didn't want to hear about it; but he insisted, and went on telling me.
Q. What did he tell you?
A. In the first place, he said that "It wasn't my fault. I am very sorry for what we have done. I never thought of ever killing or hurting anybody. I drank, but I never wanted to hurt or kill anybody; but it was Toy Toy's fault altogether. He had arranged

<pb/>

<p>the plans to kill Anna Edna."

Q. Well, what else did he say?
A. He said that he met Toy Toy, or was with Toy Toy in Pendleton, and as they came around near Damon's saloon Toy Toy said "Let's go in the saloon, the back part of the saloon, and have something to drink.""So we went in, and Toy Toy asked for order for a bottle of whisky. He got it and we drank it. After we took a few drinks, why, he commenced telling me about what we should do. He says "Let's kill that old woman. She is an Indian doctor. She killed my father, and you came very near dying on account of her, and let's us kill her."
Q. Meant that Columbia George came very near dying?
A. Yes, sir. And then he said that "I was afraid; didn't want to do it. After drinking some more, kept on talking about it, and then I consented, and aked him, 'Well, how are we going to do it?' He says, 'We will go over here to the drug store and get some poison' He said he told Toy Toy "How will I tell them" Toy Toy says 'We will go in there, and you tell him taht coyotes are killing off our chickens, giving us trouble, and we want to get some poison, some medicine, to kill them, kill the coyotes off. And I told his that I didn't have the money to buy it with. We went into the drug store. He said that he had the money; that he would give me the money. And we went off and went into the drug store, and he gave me a quarter to buy the poison with, and I went in, while Toy Toy stood at the door, the front door,"looking that nobody would see them, watch them there. "And I went in there and asked the man to give me medicine to kill coyotes. He gave me a small bottle." Paid two bites for it, and they got a bottle. GOt of bottle of alcohol in the drug store; paid 50 cents for it.

<p>They went out. "Then Toy Toy says, 'Let's go up - let's go up the river and look for Anna Edna, and we will fixt it. We will mix it up there. After we get up on the road, we will mixt it, and have it all ready. So we went up. When we got to this place, a little bridge above Pendleton about a mile and a half, we got off our horses, and then we had an empty bottle, small flask, about a two-bit size - half pint flask. And Toy Toy filled this bottle with water about half full, and filled the rest of it with water, filled it up, and then put some of this poison in it."

Q. Filled it up with water or alcohol?
A. The alcohol was poured into the half pint bottle, and then the water, and then it was mixed with strychnine. He said that Toy Toy done all this, and that he had it in his hands shaking it a long time. After shaking it, Toy Toy says, "Let's go back to town. I don't think Anna Edna has come out yet. I believe she is in town. Let's go back there and find her.""Then when we went back, we went on, before we got to town, he told me that I must go up and give it to her. After we found out that she wasn't in town,"-
Q. Did he speak about meeting anybody?
A. No, I don't recollect that he did; I don't believe he did. Then he said that Toy Toy told him to go up and find this old woman, and get her to drink it. "I went back up; got up to her house. She was there. I had the bottle in my pocket, and I took it out and offered it to her, and she took a drink; and then I took the bottle and I left the house. Then I went back towards town."</p>
