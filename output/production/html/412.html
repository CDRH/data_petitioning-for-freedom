    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On February 8th, 1919, Nellie Atkins was arrested and charged with vagrancy, prostitution, and maintaining and keeping a common and ill-governed house. On February 10th, she pleaded not guilty in court but was found guilty. She was sentenced to 90 days in jail and a $100 fine. She immediately appealed this decision. She furnished $400 in bonds and the Magistrate issued her release. Nellie claimed that despite the issue from the Magistrate, the Chief of Police and Keeper of the Jail were not releasing her. It was on these grounds which she filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, also on February 10th. The judge granted her petition. A hearing for this writ was scheduled for July; between the issuance of the petition and the hearing Nellie was released on her own recognizance. On July 15th, 1919, the judge allowed Nellie's writ and she was released from custody. </li>
