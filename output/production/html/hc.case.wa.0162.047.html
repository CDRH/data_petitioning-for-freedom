      <p class="tei_p">Now comes the defendant and
moved the court to quash and set aside the

grounds following to wit:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">1.-That it is not entitled in this

      <p class="tei_p">3.- The Grand jury finding the

not selected drawn or empannelled as required
by law in this: That the list of said Grand
Jurors was drawn from an imperfect and
incomplete list of persons in Spokane

the list of names prepared by the County Commissioners 
from which said list was drawn
did not contain the names of all of the

as Grand Jurors, and other persons in
said Spokane County qualified to serve as

was prepared were omitted therefore and
their names do not appear thereon

<span class="tei_add">qualified grand jurors in spokane county and was fraud by the
commitment by the persons of grand jury from their defined district

had no authority to entertain pass upon

whatever for the reason defendant was
under recognizance for her appearance

a right to challenge the panel or
any individual member thereof
of which right by this action the grand
jury she has been deprived.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">5.- That an indictment is
now pending in this court charging defendant
