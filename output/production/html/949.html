    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In 1913, D. L. Anderson took his young son, Cecil Anderson, from his and his wife's house in Kansas to his parents' house in Oregon. When three years had passed and D. L. had not returned with Cecil, his then-wife, Ina Anderson, secured a divorce in a Kansas district court. Ina then traveled to Oregon and petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the Marion County Circuit Court, which was granted. She initially named D. L.'s parents, William and Nancy Anderson, as the respondents. William and Nancy refused to cooperate, arguing that it was D. L., not them, who had custody. Ina then amended her petition to include D. L. as a respondent, forcing him to appear in court. After some back and forth, the two parties resolved the dispute outside of court, and the cause was dismissed without prejudice. The case file does not specify what happened to Cecil.</li>
