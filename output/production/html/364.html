    <li>Summary of Proceedings: John D. Decora was arrested after a complaint was made by Louise Johnson Bear to Thurston County on March 14, 1910; that Decora had deserted wife Helen Johnson Decora on September 22, 1909, and had been having a sexual affair with an unmarried woman, Grace Graywolf, and has lived with Graywolf since then. Decora was charged with adultery and wife desertion, his trial was held on March 25, 1910, but he refused any legal representation. Decora plead guilty to the charge of adultery and was sentenced to four months in Thurston County jail with only bread and water. On April 15, Decora and attorney, Charles T. Dickinson filed for habeas against Douglas County sheriff, E. F. Brailey; charging that Brailey had no authority to detain Decora in Douglas County. On April 18, Decora was released from Douglas County custody and transferred back to Thurston County authorities.</li>
