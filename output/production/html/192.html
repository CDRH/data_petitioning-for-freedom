    <li>Summary of Proceedings: It was November 1924 when James Dolezol petitioned for and received an order of writ of Habeas Corpus after being arrested and held in custody by Dennis H. Cronin and Micheal L, Endres in July of that year. Dolezol had been charged with violation of the National Prohibition Act and had been given a hearing for said charges where he was sentenced to three months imprisonment on two counts and a fine of $400. In his petition he presented that he was being unlawfully depreciated of his liberty and held in custody for longer than the imposed time of imprisonment. In December of the same year the court agreed, and he was discharged. In March of 1925 Cronin and Endres filed for and were allowed an appeal based on assignments of error. They presented that the imprisonment of three months on two accounts was ordered to run consecutively meaning that time of imprisonment would be six months and that the time of imprisonment was imposed until the fine was paid of which Dolezol had not paid. It was February of the following year that the Circuit Court of Appeals made the order to reverse the December 1924 order allowing the writ of Habeas Corpus and to remand Dolezol to custody in compliance with the decision of the case Cronin, U.S. Marshal et al., vs Wiliam J. Fox. which was carried out later that month.</li>
