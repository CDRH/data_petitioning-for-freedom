    <li>Summary of Proceedings: John F. Decker petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that he was unlawfully detained by Sheriff Nicholas Ress. Judge Holmes granted the petition and allowed him bail at the sum of 300 dollars. Decker had been arrested on the charge of perjury after he falsely claimed during a divorce trial that he was a resident of Lancaster County, Nebraska. After hearing evidence, Judge Holmes ruled that Decker had not committed perjury and therefore was being illegally detained. He ordered that Decker be released from custody. However, he ordered that the County Attorney, James L. Caldwell, prosecute Decker for the charge of contempt of court and punish him accordingly. Caldwell immediately followed through in State of Nebraska vs John F. Decker where again Decker was released on bail. The outcome of this case is unknown. Weeks later, Caldwell produced a motion for a re-hearing and a new trial for Decker's habeas corpus case, which the court overruled. In 1906, Caldwell's appeal was tried in the Nebraska Supreme Court, who later dismissed his petition in error.</li>
