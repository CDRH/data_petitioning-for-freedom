    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In June 1888, Mary Ellen Lyts left her husband, William D. Lyts, and took their five-year-old son Francis with her. According to Mary Ellen's petition, William "forcibly removed" Francis from her custody on the 20th of March 1889. The next day, Mary Ellen filed a writ of habeas corpus to have Francis returned to her custody, claiming that he was being "unlawfully imprisoned, detained, confined, and restrained of his liberty" by William. The petition was granted and William was ordered to produce Francis in court the following day. Later that same day, William's lawyer responded with a letter claiming that Francis is being held to "secure proper maintenance and education" for the child and that Mary Ellen is "unfit" and lacks the means to support his well-being. The letter also claims that Mary Ellen "abandoned and deserted" William and moved in with a man named Fred Brooks. The day after the petition, letters were exchanged where Mary Ellen's lawyers denied William's claim. William's lawyer responded, requesting a delay to the proceedings until April 2 and offering to allow Francis to live with a third party until the proceedings. On April 2nd, the judge ruled for Mary Ellen, giving her primary custody of Francis while allowing visitation and up to one week per month of custody for William. Mary Ellen was ordered to pay for the costs of the proceeding.</li>
