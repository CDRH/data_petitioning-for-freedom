      <p class="tei_p">Dr J. M. Morgan Sworn</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I was called to see a man
lying in the Hall of the house called the
Bay windows <del/> lying upon his 
back in the North hall of the building
there is two front doors to the hall his 
head, part of the shouders were outside
the inner door he had a pillow under 
his head, the man had a wound upon
the right side of his neck he was unconsious 
The breath was laboring there
was no pulsation of the radial artery 
by passing my hand on the region 
of the heart there was a very faint flutter 
scarcely perceptable, I remained until
he died and saw his body after death 
in my opinion the wound caused his 
death did not hear the shot dont know 
how long after when I arrived It <span class="tei_add">was</span> 8 minutes 
of one oclock when <span class="tei_add">a</span> man came to my 
office to go there, he died at one fifty five
oclock</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Cross Ex</p>

      <p class="tei_p">
         <del>It was</del> across one block and one street I walked
as fast as possible I think not but three
Minutes after I was called before I got there</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The man was lying as follows <span class="tei_add">head &amp; shoulders</span> outside 
the inner door his body extending East 
&amp; west with a pillow under his head 
saw there when I first went about 20 
persons and do not know that I can name 
any particular one – I paid particular attention

<span class="hr"> </span>

to the Wounded Man I might add by way of 
Correction that I said Ruby standing in the 
door leaning into the Middle Parlor,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Door in the outside of the hall was open
when I arrived, Saw a Man 5 foot 8 to
10 In - heighth Would weigh about 160 pounds 
rather broad shoulder hair Sandy &amp; Cart close, 
quite heavy sandy Moustache some gray hair 
in it, balance face shorn smooth appeared to be
fresh showered forehead  <span class="tei_add">or frontal sinus</span> very low and very heavy
the lower jaw, was also heavy, the whole face 
was heavy and from the appearance of the
Man I judged him to be rather a rough 
character at the time He had on a pair 
Cheap blue overals, a dark colored coat
had <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> a little light thread running through 
the Material flannel shirt had been 
laced up in front, was not when I 
first saw him his Boots were well 
worn one ripped in the eye seem and
heels were worn of upon side as I remember
them I dont think the Overalls were
rolled up at the bottom he had no <del/> hat 
and I saw none in the Hall I passed
a probe in the wound and found that the 
ball passed from the right side across 
and down and inwards beneath the Sternum</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I can describe the position of the assailant 
and assailed <del>from the wound</del> at the time he
<del/> received the wound</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The assailant was to the right and 

<span class="hr"> </span>

in front it <span class="tei_add">the ball</span> ranged cross and downwards 
<del>crossed and breaking I ha</del> (illustrated to the 
court positions)</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I remained until the 
man died which was 1.55 O'Clock Am</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As I stated before there was quite 
a crowd there I was working with the 
Man, My first efforts was to see if 
there was no external hemorage or from 
any vessels within reach, Next to restore
the action of the heart failing in that the 
Man died there were several there most of 
them were strangers to me they brougth 
everything I asked for, I was furnished 
with brandy there the party was a stranger
that brought it to me I do not know 
his name, one man I do know his 
features but not his name</p>
