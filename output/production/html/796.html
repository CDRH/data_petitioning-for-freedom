    <li>Summary of Proceedings: This supplemental petition was filed because Rose claimed that no &#x201C;proper or legal complaint&#x201D; had been filed against him as required by law. He states that he is not a fugitive from justice but was visiting relatives in Omaha and had not left Ohio for the purpose of avoiding arrest. This file offers a restatement of the facts from the prior file; Rose was arrested wrongly, he was held without trial and no news of a trial being scheduled, he claims to have not committed any crime in Ohio and, thus, cannot be a fugitive from the law.

The form from the Justice of the Peace (George C. Cockrell) states that a complaint was submitted by Deputy Sheriff Louis Grebe on 31 August 1899 stating that on or about 1 August 1899, Rose was a fugitive from justice from Common Court in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Deputy Grebe claims that Rose stood accused of the crime of embezzlement (a sum of $300), committed in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. 

George C. Cockrell (Justice of the Peace) signed an order on 1 September 1899 to the Keeper of the Common Jail to keep Angelo Rose for &#x201C;further examination,&#x201D; as he had been charged with committing the offence of Fugitive from Justice. An order that the Sheriff release Rose to allow him to appear in court on 1 September 1899 was submitted on 31 August 1899 by Coblyn L. Frank (Clerk). 

Judge B. S. Baker ordered that Rose&#x2019;s writ be allowed and ordered that a writ of habeas corpus be issued in favor of Angelo Rose, returnable on 1 September 1899 at 2:00pm directed to Sheriff John McDonald. </li>
