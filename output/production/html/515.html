    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On 25 March 1893, James Plunkett (Mary&#x2019;s father) committed Mary to the care and custody of Sister Mary Michael (petitioner) along with two other children; Eddie Plunkett and Katie Plunkett. Katie was around 1.5 years older than Mary and Eddie is around 3 years older than Mary. Their mother had passed away and James was &#x201C;not so situated as to be able to keep house, or suitably care for his said children.&#x201D; In December of 1895, James passed away without providing any guardian for the children. He did not leave any means or property of any kind which could be used to provide for the children. He in no way revoked his commitment of the children to the care of petitioner.
Sister Mary Michael (petitioner) was in charge of Saint James&#x2019; Orphanage. The children were continuously in the care of petitioner until 11 April 1896. The petitioner was under the assumption that the children did not have any living relatives and were not provided or cared for by any person other than said petitioner. On 11 April 1896, the two older children (Katie and Eddie) were placed in the care of Dennis Kane. The petitioner was not aware that Kane was willing to take more than two of the children. Subsequently, petitioner placed Mary Plunkett in the care of the Costello family where she stayed until December of that year. Petitioner was then informed that Kane was willing and ready to take care of Mary as well, allowing all three children to be raised together. Kane and his wife stated that they would legally adopt all three Plunkett children (giving them rights of inheritance). 
Sister Mary Micheal then went to the Costello family&#x2019;s home and, with their consent, took Mary back to the aforementioned orphanage. She arranged for Mary&#x2019;s transportation to the Kane&#x2019;s home. On 19 December 1896, Mrs. McAdo came to the orphanage and asked for Mary to stay with her and her daughter overnight. The two made an agreement that Mrs. McAdo would bring Mary to the Webster St. Depot on the following day to take the train to the Kane home. On the following day, Mrs. McAdo refused to bring Mary to the train and has, ever since, refused to allow her to go to the Kane&#x2019;s home or return to the petitioner. 
Petitioner believes that Mrs. McAdo is not suitably situated to have the care and custody of said child. It would be in the best interest of Mary to allow her to be raised with her siblings by Dennis Kane and his wife who are well qualified and suited. 
Sister Mary Michael asks that a Writ of Habeas Corpus be granted so that Mary will be released to the custody of petitioner for the purpose of bringing her to Mr. Kane. Sister Mary Michael signed this petition on 12 January 1897. Judge Baker ordered that the writ be allowed, ordering that Mrs. McAdo come to the Court House with Mary Plunkett at 10:00am on 16 January 1897.
Sheriff McDonald signed a statement that the writ was received on 14 January 1897 and that it would be served to Mrs. McAdo on the same day. In a document filed 2 March 1897, Judge Baker stated that the Court found for Sister Mary Michael, stating that said petitioner was &#x201C;entitled to the care and custody&#x201D; of Mary Plunkett and that the best interests of the child would be served by awarding her custody to the petitioner. Albyn L. Frank (District Court Clerk) then filed a motion for the costs to be taxed to Douglas County. This motion was sustained by the Court (Judge Baker) on 9 June 1898.</li>
