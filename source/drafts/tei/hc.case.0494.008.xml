<p>UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON. Northern Division.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Petition of H. C. LITTOOY for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>
<p>No. 1207. Filed..........</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM DECISION ON THE QUESTION OF JURISDICTION.</p>

<p>By the record in this case it appears that the petitioner has be convicted in a court of this state of a violate of a statute requiring all dentists, under a prescribed penalty, to obtain a license to practice that profession.</p>
<p>The petitioner alleges that he has the qualification of education, skill and experience required for doing satisfactory work as a dentist, and that he has complied with all the conditions which may be lawfully exacted of an applicant for a license, but that the Board of Dental Examiners have refused to grant him a license to practice dentistry for noncompliance on his part with arbitrary and unreasonable exactions, and that for practicing dentistry without a license, after it had been refused, he has been arrested and deprived of the liberty guaranteed to citizens of the United States by the constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>The police power of the state undoubtedly includes the right of the state government to prescribe regulations for the protection of sufferers requiring treatment by professional dentists, and to prohibit dentists from practicing their profession if they fail to conform to the prescribed regulations. The natural right of an individual to pursue a useful calling, without unreasonable interference and obstruction by the government, is important, and among the important rights which the constitution was intended to preserve to the people. It is a right, however, that is subordinate to the power of the state to make reasonable laws and regulations for the general welfare. Keeping these principles in view, if the petitioner has any grievance cognizable in a federal court, it must be on one of the two grounds, viz.: First, that the statute under which he has been prosecuted is in some of its provisions repugnant to the constitution of the United States; or, second, that the proceedings against him or the punishment inflicted are unusual and not authorized by the laws of the state. The issues to be determined being thus narrowed, the court is required to go further and exercise a disoretion in interfering with the administration of the laws of the state, by means of the writ of habeas corpus. This is so because it would be practically impossible to carry on our system of dual government, state and national, if, as a matter of right, every person considering himself aggrieved by being convicted of an offense in a state court may require a review of the proceedings against him in a national court, and the volume of litigation in the national courts would be far beyond the capacity of the judicial system which congress has provided, and if the national courts granted writs of habeas corpus to all applicants, the state governments would be obstructed tot he extent of suspending the enforcement of criminal alws through the instrumentality of state tribunals. It is settled by numerous decisions of the supreme court, that thet United States courts may and must exercise discretion in granting or refusing writs of habeas corpus to persons convicted under state laws, and that unless extraordinary conditions demand that the writ issue it should be refused in all cases where irregularities, errors and injustice may be corrected by a review of the proceedings in an appellate court of competent jurisdiction, and where the way remains open for the aggrieveed party to submit his cause finally to the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<p>This court in the exercise of its discretion has heretofore deemed it proper to protect petitioners from vexatious prosecutions for past violations of statutes of the state or municipal ordinances which upon inspection appeared to be necessarily and obviously absolutely void, but when only irregularities have been complained of in proceedings founded upon valid statutes, the petitioners have been required to exhaust their remedies in the appellate courts.</p>
<p>The case now under consideration does not present any extraordinary features which seem to require or justify a departure from the practice in preceding cases. All that can be claimed in favor of immediate action for the petitioner's relief is, that the desire to be spared from the consequential injuries and annoyance of being prevented from practicing his profession during the pendency of a test case in the appellate courts. But these are consequences which cannot be avoided. The constitutionality of a statute of this state, and the integrity of the state board of dental examiners are challenged by the petition, and there is every reason to suppose taht a decision of this court, if in his favor, would be brought for review before the court of highest authority, as it should be. The statute which the petitioner attacks is not so obviously void that intelligent and reasonable minds may not honestly differ in their opinions with respect to it, and the courts of the state which have so far sustained it, will not be required to defer to a contrary opinion until the highest court of the state, or the Supreme Court of the United States has an opportunity to render a decision of binding force. Therefore, if discharged, the petitioner would be unable to practice dentistry in this state, unlicensed, without risk of being again arrested and prosecuted and convicted and sentenced in the courts of the state during the pendency of proceedings in the appellate court, and as the Supreme Court of the United States is the only national court which can shield him from repeated prosecutions, it is expedient for him to got to that court in the most direct way, which is by an appeal or writ of error in the case in whic he has been convicted. No advantage whatever in the saving of time or expense can be gained by having the disputed questions passed upon in this court.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, I direct that the writ be discharged, and the case dismissed.</p>
