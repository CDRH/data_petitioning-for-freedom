ATTORNEY AND COUNSELLOR AT LAW</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Everett, Washington, June 1, 1914.</p>
      <div class="note">n. g.</div>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr. C. A. Turner, <br/>
Immigrant Inspector, <br/>
Everett, Wash.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have yours of the 29th May last advising that I might have the 
privilege of cross examining the several officers who have submitted
their statements and views making up the record in Marie Robina Deportation
proceedings. Being mindful of the fact that this matter has been pending
since the month of January last, and realizing the impracticability and 
great inconvenience of getting the testimony of these officers located as 
they are in Salem, Oregon, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, I am 
willing that the case be now submitted with a view to getting a decision 
without other and further delays, From the record in this case I note that 
my letter to you of date 21st May 1914 relative to this proceeding has been 
detached. In order that the contents of said letter may come to the notice
of the department at Washington, D.C., may I ask that the same be attached
and made a part of this record for whatever consideration the latter tribunal 
see fit to give it.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Yours very truly,</p>
      <span class="tei_ab">(Signed) Noah Shakespeare, <br/>
Attorney for Marie Robina, respondent herein.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Dict.</span>
