The action of Judge Dennison is going away to prevent the holding of this term of Court, has brought upon him the condemnation of all classes of men in this community. Those who have heretofore been inclined to apologize for his political defection and to claim for him judicial integrity, now see that he is actuated by feelings of hatred and revenge. He knew that the people of this sub District did not desire his continuance on the bench, and for that reason, he would do all that lay in his power, to prevent the maintenance and enforcement of the law. He knew that a number of persons were in jail awaiting trail, and that in one case of homicide, the witnesses were confined, being unable to give security for their appearance. He also knew that Judge Jacobs would come and hold the Court if invited by him to do so, and he refused to extend the invitation.

Judge Jacobs in coming and holding our Court, upon the petition of the people of the district, has conferred a favor that will long be remembered.&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Message.</hi>
