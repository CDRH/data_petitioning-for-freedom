    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In July 1919, George W. Willett filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of James Gannon. The petition alleged Gannon was being unlawfully restrained of his liberty by John T. Dunn, Chief of Detectives, without warrant or complaint, and that said restraint is without due process of law. In the answer and return to the writ, John T. Dunn stated that the Seward County Attorney, through the Chief of Police of Lincoln, directed him to arrest and apprehend Gannon for the purpose of turning him over to Gus A. Hyers, Chief Agent of the Governor of Nebraska. The answer and writ further alleged that Gannon was accused of bootlegging in Seward County in violation of state liquor laws and fled to Douglas County. Judge Willis G. Sears authorized the petition and rued that there was no charge filed in Seward against Gannon, therefore John T. Dunn was ordered to discharge Gannon from his custody.</li>
