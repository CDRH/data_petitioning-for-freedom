    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On 5 April 1912, Sarah Younsum presented a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to Judge A. L. Sutton who then ordered that a writ be issued in favor of Minne Boxter, the daughter of Younsum, returnable on 6 April 1912. The writ was directed to Bessie Early, who Younsum had stated was unlawfully depriving Boxter of her liberty. Younsum&#x2019;s original petition only states that Boxter was &#x201C;allowed to go to said Bessie Early,&#x201D; and has been detained and &#x201C;deprived of her right to go to her mother&#x201D; since that time. The date at which Boxter went to Early is not stated. Sheriff McShane&#x2019;s writ return, which was filed 17 April 1912, stated that he served the writ to Early on 6 April 1912. The Appearance Docket notes that the parties appeared in court before Judge Leslie on 6 April 1912 and then the trial continued on 13 April 1912. The Docket states that the writ was denied and the case dismissed on 20 April 1912.&#xA0;The "custody" of Boxter is not directly stated in the case file.</li>
