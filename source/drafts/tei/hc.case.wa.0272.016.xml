 of errors upon which he will rely on his appeal from the order of this

Western District of Washington ordering him to appear before said court on the 26th day of February 1906
and show cause, if any, why the writ of Habeas Corpus should not be issued as prayed for in said petitions.</p>
<p>3. The court erred in sustaining the objections of the United States District Attorney to the evidence
offered by the petitioner to-wit a patent of the United States issued to the said Columbia George for certain
lands scheudled ot the said Columbia George as his allotment, upon the Umatilla Indian Reservation in the
State of Oregon which is refered to in the record and marked "Exhibit A."</p>

<p>6.</p>

<p>The court erred in holding and deciding at the hearing of said petition that the court could not receive

was a full blood Indian and an allotte upon the Umatilla Indian Reservation in the State of Oregon and as such
was at said time a citezen of the United States and of the state of Oregon both civil and criminal and that
