vs. 
Ray Raymond
W.A. Gibbons
being duly sworn on my
oath depose and say that
I am now and have been
for the past twenty years a 
resident of Hangman Creek Spokane
County Washington Territory.
That I have heard that there 
was such a case as that above
named. That I am well acquainted 
with the people residing in said Hangman 
Creek precinct and have personal 
acquintance with the
people most of them. That I have
had opportunity to hear the 
opinion and sentiment of
the people of said precinct
expressed and in a genera
way know this same. That
I have now heard my expressions 
of hostility &amp; or 
prejudice against the said defendant 
Ray Raymond in said
precinct. That of there were
any such expressions of prejudice 
ot ill will by the people
of said precinct against said
defendant I should certainly
have heard them. That from
my first information the alleged 
facts relating to the homicide 
out of which said action 
great are not sufficiently
known to the people of said
precinct to have enabled there
give an opinion for the
guilt or innocence of said defendant. 
And that further
saith that there are about
four hundred people living
in said Hangman Creek precinct
and that he verily believe that
have murder or loyally was
just jurors can be second
on said precinct at said
as prejudice said action
and further applicant saith not.
