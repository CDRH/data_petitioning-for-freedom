    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 27, 1919, Mamie Allen petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, and the next day it was filed. In her petition, Allen claimed she was unlawfully imprisoned in the Detention Home. She was arrested on August 23 and charged with vagrancy contrary to the statute of the state of Nebraska. On August 25, the court sentenced her to thirty days in county jail. Although she offered to pay the bonds for the appeal, Judge Charles E. Foster refused to accept. Because of the conviction for vagrancy, the Health Department held her on mittimus for an examination for any venereal diseases under the custody of Elizabeth Hardy, the keeper of the Detention Home. On August 29, 1919, the Judge accepted the petition and filed a writ of habeas corpus. The same day, Elizabeth Hardy responded to the writ, claiming that she was authorized to hold Allen because the state of Nebraska Ordinance No. 10222 mandated her to do so. The outcome of this proceeding is unknown.  </li>
