<p>No 4764</p>

<p>United <del>States District Court</del> for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Nora Sullivan for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>Petition and Corroborating Affidavit.</p>

<p>Tx</p>

<p>Filed in the United States District Court</p>
<p>Western District of Washington</p>
<p>Northern Division</p>

<p>Aug 15 1919</p>

<p>F.M. Harshberger</p>

<p>F.M. Harshberger, Clerk</p>
<p>By <gap></gap> Deputy</p>

<p>M.J. Costello,</p>
<p>Attorney for Petitioner,</p>

<p>No. 4764</p>
<p>Affidavit.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Nora Sullivan, for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p><del>The United States of America</del></p>

<p><del><unclear></unclear></del></p>

<p><del>The Commissioner of Immigration and his Deputies of the Bureau of Immigration and his officials in the City of Seattle, District and Division aforesaid:</del></p>

<p>United States of America, State of Washington, County of King.</p>

<p>SS.</p>

<p>Mary Sullivan, being first duly sworn, deposes and says: That she resides at 703 Marion Street in the City of Seattle, and has resided in said city for the past four months; that she came to Seattle in the company of her friend Nora Sullivan, of whom she has been the intimate companion and friend ever since her childhood; that she is following the calling of wait<del>t</del>ress and is now employed in the Gem Waffle House on James Street between Second and Third Avenue;I have known the above-named Nora Sullivan intimately and well both in Ireland and in Butte, Montana, as well as in the city of Seattle,and I know her people, the members of her family both in the Old Country and in this; she has always been, as a child and as a young woman, of my knowledge, in perfect health until her recent illness in Butte, Montana; she never at any time gave the slightest indication of insanity, and no member of her family has ever <del>been so</del> done so to my knowledge; and knowing the family I can say of my own knowledge that no trace of insanity has ever been known to prevail in that family or among its members;</p>

<pb/>

<p>The reasons set forth for Nora Sullivan's illness in her Petition to the Court are correct; I know that she suffered from those causes prior to and during her illness; I visited her while she was an inmate of Warm Springs Hospital near Butte, Montana, some three weeks before her discharge therefrom; she seemed then, and I believe was, in perfect control of her mental faculties, and looked forward with pleasure to her coming discharge; we resumed our intimate association and friendship after her discharge from the Hospital, and she never at any time afterwards either in Butte or in Seattle complained of illness or showed any signs whatever of ailment of any kind, either mental or physical; the complaints from which she suffered prior to going to the hospital and while in the hospital, and which are set forth in her Petition and which includes severe rheumatism, seemed all to have left her as the result of her treatment in the hospital and she never afterwards up to the present time complained or gave any indication of being troubled in either of the two respects mentioned; I believe Nora Sullivan always looked forward to maintaining her residence in the United States and to becoming in time a citizen of the United States; she has adapted herself in every way to the habits and modes of life prevailing here,and,except in the regard that she has not become naturalized, and that she is not a native of this land, she cannot, in justice or reason, be regarded as an alien; and the statement that she is now insane or that she was insane when she came to Butte, Montana, from Ireland, I can testify has no foundation whatever in fact; she was in ill health owing to constitutional troubles and in my judgement any interference with her mental <del></del> state was due to that cause alone; and was merely temporary in operation.</p>

<p>Mary Sullivan</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 14th day of August, 1919.</p>

<p>Joseph M Taylor</p>

<p>Notary Public in and for the State of Washington, residing at Seattle.</p>
