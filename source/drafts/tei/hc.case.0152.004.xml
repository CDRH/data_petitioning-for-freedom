Ray Raymond
I S.C. Hyde being duly 
sworn on my oath depose 
and say: That I 
am prosecuting attorney
for the District under acting
Spokane County, Washington
Territory, and that as such
prosecuting attorney, I am
charged with the duty of
the prosecution of the above
entitled action. That I work
this affidavit because James
Finch. The person names
in the indictment in
the above named action
as the person murdered
was at the time of his
death a stranger in the
city of Spokane Falls, and
had been an above elect of
Spokane County, but a
effort been, and that
there are now no friends
or relatives of said James
Finch living in Spokane
County or within the knowledge 
of applicant toward
this affidavit or to with
not there cannot in the prosecution 
of this action.
Applicant further said
that he has read the affidavits 
of T.C. Griffitts, J. Kennedy
Stout, Ray Raymond, Frederick
Stanford, H.T. Caton, George
F. Schor, Charles Aldrich
Filed in support of the
defendants motion for change
of venue in this action,
and knows the confines
thereof. That applicant appeared
as counsel and attorney for
the Territory in all proceeding
heretofore had in the prosecution 
of this action. That 
he was in the city of Spokane 
Falls, the place
where the homicide occured
out of which this action
arises, at the time of the
homicide. That he was then
ever since has been and
is now a resident of
said city of Spokane Falls
and has been a resident 
of said city and county
for the last seven years.
That applicant is well acquainted
with the residents of said
county of Spokane throughout
the county and has personal 
acquaintance with
a large shore of them.
That it is well known
to all the people of Spokane
County that this the public
prosecutor therein, and as
such officer is charged
with the prosecution of
all persons charged with
crime. Applicant further saith
that if excitement and
prejudice against the
defendant is this action
existed in said county of
Spokane, the same owing
to applicant beinf the person
charged with the duty of
her prosecution, would have
been as applicant verily believes, 
known and common
to the applicant. That applicant 
knows of no excitement
existing among the people of said county ever
and concerning said action
and the homicide out of 
which said action grew
and knows of no prejudice
existing against said defendant 
came then always
attended the most ordinary
homicide followed by
a criminal charge.
That at the time of the
homicide there was no excitement 
in the city of
Spokane Falls concerning
the same and no prejudice
against the defendant
because thereof more than
the actual facts conerning 
the same being known
would naturally produce,
that such prejudice as existed 
against defendant
of the time of the homicide 
on account thereof
in said city was not of
much importance and extended 
to but a small
those of the community,
and applicant says that
such prejudice has long
since passed away and
that the people of Spokane
Falls now take aim in
least in this case and
that they would now all
wish that said defendant 
have a fair and just trial
that during the present term
of court not more than a
dozen persons have ever
mentioned hthe said defendant 
to this applicant, and
they only incidentally or to
inquest when this action would
be tried.
Applicant further saith
that at the general election
held in Spokane County on
the second day of November
1886, more than four thousand 
voted were cast in
Spokane County, that there
all now as applicant believes, 
more than twelve
thousand people residing 
in said county. That appicant
is informed by intelligent
and truthful citizens residing 
at no side places
in Spokane County, outside 
of the city of Spokane
County, of whom applicant
has made inquiry, that
the elleged facts acting
to the said homicide are
little known to the people
of Spokane County who
reside outside the limits
of Spokane Falls, and that
they have not formed any
opinioin as to the guilt
or innocence of said defendant 
and are not
prejudiced against her,
and applicant verily believes
the same is the fact.
That applicant verily believes
and has no doubt it is
the fact that a good lawful 
and unprejudiced
jury, who have never
heard the purported
facts in this case, nor
formed an opinion as to 
the guilt or innocence 
of this defendant can
be easily secured in this
county from untrue beyond 
the limits for Spo-
kane Falls, to by this
action. 
Applicant further saith that
he has never heard of the
support of charge against
the defendant stated on
page 2 of the affidavit 
of T.C. Griffitts, relating
to murders committed by 
defendant and applicant does
not believe such charges
could have been generally
circulated or he would
have been informed of the
same. That it is not
time that during the
examination of the defendant 
the prosecuting attorney
denounced the class of
woman to which it was
stated the defendant belonged
not that the denounced
the defendant save for
her acts and conduct
relating to the homicide
in question. That
all the facts relating to
the same were such as ordinarily 
occur in debate
and argument in the
trial of a criminal case
and in this case such
denunciation of the 
deceased by counsel for
the prisoner or in reply
to assertions 
in favor of the defendant
and her conduct in the
matter of the homicide,
first made by counsel
for the defendant that
such examination in justice
court was held in  a very 
small room; that there
were not many present
at the examination, and
they principally idles and
that a representation class
of our citizens.
That applicant has never
record or been informed
of any desire or attempt 
by being one to employ
any one to assist the
prosecuting attorney in
the prosecution of said
defendant and if the 
same were true applicant 
would most certainly have
been informed thereof.
That George M. Forther
mentioned in the affidavit
of F.C. Griffitts herein, appeared 
and assisted the
prosecuting attorney in the
hearing on habeas corpus
at the special instance
and request of this applicant
for a retained and not
otherwise and that
applicant has paid said Forther
the sum of Twenty five
dollars from his 
personal bonds therefore
and that it is the confide 
intention of this
applicant whenever he shall
be in more applicant circumstances 
should that
ever happen, to inquire of
said Forther what his charge
are for said District and
to pay him the balance
due herein therefore from
the personal amongst of offront
Applicant further says 
that not.
