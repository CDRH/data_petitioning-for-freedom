<p>Territory of Washington Plaintiff
vs.
Ray Raymond Defendant
Territory of Washington</p>

<p>County of Spokane}ss George F.</p>
<p>George F. Schor being first 
duly sworn on oath states I am a citizen
of Spokane County, Washington Territory
and I now do, fo several weeks last
oast I have resided at Spokane Falls
in said county, but prior thereto for
more than two years I resided in
Cheney in said County, and I was residing 
at Cheney in said county at the
time of the alleged killing of the second
herein in June 1886 I <del>have many
lists</del> am the editor and publisher 
of the Weekend Tribune a weekly
newspaper pulished in said county, I 
at the time of such killing or immediately
following the same and many times
since I have heard many different
statements of what purported to be the
facts in the case among and

<pb/>

by the people of Spokane County, and I 
have heard many expressions
of bitter prejudice against deft
among the inhabitants of the county
and almost universal expression
of better belief in her guilt and 
a desire to see her punished
whether guilty or not. I have conversations 
I have had with and
listened to among the inhabitants
of Spokane County I believe this
defendant cannot have a fair
trial in this county of Spokane
owing to the excitement and
prejudice of the inhabitants and
people of the county against
her.</p>
