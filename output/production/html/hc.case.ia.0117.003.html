      <p class="tei_p">In re Petition Sac and Fox Indians for Habeas Corpus</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Exclusive jurisdiction over these Indians, except as limited in the act, transferred to the United States, by Act of the 26th General Assembly, which went into effect Feb. 20th 1896</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sec. 3 of the Act specifies limitations</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By an Act approved June 10th 1896 of 1st Session 54 Congress, this jurisdiction was accepted, subject to the limitations.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In this Act of Congress the above Act of the 26th General Assembly is referred to as "passed on the 16th day of Jan 1896" There is nothing in the Act of the Assembly to show on what day it was passed. It was approved Feb. 14th 1896 and became a law by publication on Feb. 20th</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>



      <p class="tei_p">By the same Act of Congress $35,000 was appropriated for the purchase of a sit and for building and furnishing an industrial boarding school for these Indians at or near the reservation in Tama County.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Both of these enactments are parts of the general appropriation bill for Indians for the fiscal year ending June 30th 1899</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sec. 2071 R.S. gives power to organize schools for Indians with their consent. This Sec. amended June 23rd 1879 and again July 31st 1882 See Gould &amp; Tucker Vol 1 pp.488 and 489, also, Vol. 2 pp. 182 and 183</p>
