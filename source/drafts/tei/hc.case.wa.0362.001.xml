<p>IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON - NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION }
OF                               }   NO.5959
    HOSAYE SAKAGUCHI,            }   MEMORANDUM DECISION.
FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS      }   FILED: April 29, 1921</p>

<p>James Kiefer, ESQ.,                         For Petitioner,

Hon. Robert C. Saunders, U.S. Attorney,     For Respondent
Miss Charlotte Kolmitz, Ass't "</p>

<p>CUSHMAN, District Judge.</p>

<p>I conclude that the board of special inquiry was legally
constituted. On account of the conclusion reached, I do not deem
it necessary to determine whether the board and Commissioner were
right in holding the passport irregular.</p>

<p>I conclude that the finding of the board, approved by
the Commissioner, that the petitioner was liable to become a public
charge, is not so wholly devoid of supporting evidence as to warrant
this court in granting discharge on habeas corpus.</p>

<p>It may be true that the sister of petitioner and the sister's
husband, residing in the State of Washington, are able to provide
for the petitioner and it may also be true that the petitioner
is capable, as a seamstress, or otherwise, to care for herself;
but it is obvious that a new arrival in the country---a young woman---
ignorant of its language and customs, without special </p>

<pb></pb>

<p>protection, though skilled, may become a public charge by
reason of her ignorance of the county and the willingness and
ability of the sister and her husband to care for the applicant
do not take the place of the husband.</p>

<p>The husband might be presumed to accompany and remain
with the wife and it may be presumed that the husband is liable
for the maintenance of the wife throughout the entire country;
but neither presumption attaches in the case of the sister. Her
husband being established in Seattle, she will be presumed to
remain with him, but there is no presumption that the petitioner
will remain in this state. If she leaves the state, the sister's
liability for her support, under the state statute, if such exists,
would not apply.</p>

<p>Whether the board and Commissioner would be warranted
in concluding that a young Japanese woman, ignorant of the country,
unprotected by her husband, is liable to become a public charge,
because of the irregular life into which she might be forced through
mischance, it is not necessary to decide; but that would be one
of the contingencies that the board might consider along with the
other circumstances of the cause in reaching the conclusion it did.</p>

<p>The discharge upon the petition is denied.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>No.5959</p>

<p>IN THE DISTRICT COURT
OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION</p>

<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION
OF
HOSAYE SAKAGUCHI,
FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM DECISION.</p>

<p>FILED IN THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
Western District of Washington
Northern Division</p>

<p>APR 29 1921

By S.E. Leitch Deputy
