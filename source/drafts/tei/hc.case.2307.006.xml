<p>In the District Court holding terms
at Olympia for Mason and Thurston
Counties</p>

<p>In the matter of
Herman Hadlan
for a Writ of Habeas
Corpus</p>

<p>Upon reading and filing
the petition of Herman Hadlan, duly
signed and verified by him, whereby it
appears that he is illegally imprisoned
and restrained of his liberty by D.M.
Brown, Marshall of the City of Olympia
County of Thurston, Territory of
Washington, and stating wherein the
alleged illegality consists: from
which it appears to me that a Writ
of Habeas Corpus ought to issue. It is
ordered that a writ of Habeas Corpus
issue out of and under the seal of
the District Court of the Second Judicial
District of Washington Territory holding
terms at Olympia, directed to the said
D.M. Brown, Marshall as aforesaid,
commanding him to have the body of the
said Herman Hadlan before me in the
Court room of said Court at the City
of Olympia County of Thurston Territory of
Washington on the second day of July AD
1884 at the hour of three o'clock
P.M. of said day; to do and receive
what shall then and there by considered
concerning the said petitioner Herman
Hadlan; together with the time and
cause of his detention, and that you
have then and there the said Writ.</p>

<p>Dated July 2 1884
John P. Hoyt
Judge of said Court</p>

<p>Territory of Washington
County of Thurston } ss</p>

<p>I R.S. O'Bruin Clerk
of said Court hereby certify the
foregoing to be a true copy of
the order in said matter
made and entered now of <unclear></unclear>

<p>Witness my hand and the seal
