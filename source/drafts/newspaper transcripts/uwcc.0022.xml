M. c. Quinn vs. Mary Quinn for divorce came up before Judge Jones last evening. Quinn asked for a divorce from his wife Mary Quinn on the grounds that she, Mary Quinn, had married him for his money, that she had tried to poison him on several occasions, and that she was addicted to getting drunk. A witness was examined, who identified the parties and the fact of Quinn getting drunk occasionally. The decree was granted.
