    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In October 1917, Edwin T. Wentz was arrested and charged with defrauding an innkeeper and was released on bail. Upon release, Wentz was re-arrested by Federal Authorities and charged with using U.S. mail to defraud and was released on bail. Immediately after release, Wentz was arrested for a third time and charged with being a fugitive of justice. At the request of the Governor of Oregon, James Withycombe, the Governor of Nebraska, Keith Neville, granted extradition to Oregon. Wentz filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus on the grounds that he was unlawfully being deprived of his liberty and claimed he was not a fugitive of justice and the charges against him were a "ruse and trick" to injure him. Judge Arthur C. Wakeley granted the petition. In the Answer and Return to the Writ, it was claimed that the petitioner obtained money by false pretenses and fled the state of Oregon. In court, Judge Willis G. Sears ruled that Edwin was not unlawfully restrained of his liberty and the petitioner was remanded back to custody.</li>
