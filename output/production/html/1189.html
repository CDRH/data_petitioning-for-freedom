    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Harry Atkinson, 18 years old, was arrested on suspicion and lodged in the jail. Harry coaxed and compelled Willie to have committed a crime against nature, a "venereal" affair in the mouth with Willie Collins, an 8-year-old boy. The bail was set at $500 and the father, William, on behalf of Harry, argued that the acts did not constitute the crime and that the testimony didn&#x2019;t substantiate the crime. Harry was released on bail.
