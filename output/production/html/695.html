    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On 20 January 1914, Marcus Glassman was charged with being an inebriate. On 14 January 1914, petitioner was arrested on a charge of being insane and was placed in the County Jail, he has been detained there since that date. He was not granted a hearing until 28 January 1914. At that hearing, no person testified to any facts that would prove that he was either insane or an inebriate. The petition states that the &#x201C;insanity board of Douglas County, Nebraska&#x201D; has not made a finding as to whether he was an inebriate or insane, but has continued to confine the petitioner. Glassman filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on 3 February 1914 asserting that he was being unlawfully detained. Judge James P. English ordered that the writ be issued and directed to Sheriff McShane. Sheriff McShane received the writ on 3 February 1914.</li>
