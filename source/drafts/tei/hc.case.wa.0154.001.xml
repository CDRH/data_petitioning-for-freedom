<p>IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NINTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,
DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>PETER A. CLIFFORD,
PETITIONER,
vs.
HERBERT O. WILLIAMS and
GRACE E. WILLIAMS,
Respondents.</p>
<p>Petition for Writ of 
Habeas Corpus.</p>
<p>To the Honorable the Circuit Court
of the United States for the District of Washington, Northern
Division:-</p>
<p>The petition of Peter A. Clifford respectfully shows:</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>That at all the times herein stated he was and now is a citizen
and resident of the State of California, and that respon-
dents are and for more than eight months last past have been
citizens and residents of the State of Washington, in the 
County of King.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>That on the 17th day of October, A. D. 1899, one Grace E.
Long was a citizen and resident of the State of California, and
on that day your petitioner and the said Grace E. Long, at the
City and County of San Francisco, in the said State of Califor-
nia, intermarried, and bacame husband and wife, and the said
Grace E. Long thereby became Grace E. Clifford.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>That thereafter your petitioner and his said wife lived
together in the City and County of San Francisco, State of Cal-
ifornia until about the 7th day of March, A. D. 1901, and
that on or about the said last named day the said Grace E. Clif-
ford deserted and abandoned your petitioner without any just cause
and without his consent.
</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>That during the marriage of your petitioner and the said
Grace E. Clifford, there was born to them, as the issue of said
marriage, a female child, now living, and of the age of four
years, named Alice B. Clifford.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>That on the 24th day of March, A. D. 1902, the said Grace E.
Cliffored commenced an action in the Superior Court in and for
the City and County of San Francisco, State of California, for
an absolute divorce from your petitioner, and therein prayed
for the custody of said child of said mariage, and your petit-
ioner appeared in said action and filed his answer, and also a
cross-complaint for a divorce from said Grace E. Clifford there-
in, and in said cross-complaint prayed that the custody of said
child should be awarded to him by said Court.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>That thereafter such proceedings were had in such action
and cross-action that the judgment of said court was given, made and
entered therein, denying a divorce to said Grace E. Clifford and
granting a divorce to your petitioner, and awarding the custody
of said child to said Grace E. Clifford until the further order
of the court; and providing that your petitioner should be al-
lowed to see said child once a week and to take the same out
with him once in every two weeks.</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>That at the time of the commencement of said action and from
thenoe on down and including the time of the entry of said judg-
ment, your petitioner, thhe said Grace E. Clifford, and said 
child were all citizens and bona fide residents of the said City
and County of San Francisco, in said State of California, and
actually present therein, and your petitioner and the said Grace
E. Clifford had been such citizens and residents of said City
and County continuously since the date of their said marriage,
and said child had been such citizen and resident continuously
since the date of her birth, and within the jurisdiction of said
Superior Court in said acion and cross-section, and said Superior
Court was then and yet is a court of record and of superior jur-
isdiction.</p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>That after the date of entry of said judgment by said
Superior Court, the said Grace E. Clifford continued to reside
in said City and County of San Francisco until some time in 
September, A. D. 1903, the exact time being unknown to your
petitioner, and that during said moth she secretly and surrepti-
tiously and without the permission of said Superior Court,
and in contempt thereof, and without the knowledge or consent
of your petitioner, took said child out of the State of Califor-
nia.</p>
<p>IX.</p>
<p>That on the 27th day of November, A. D. 1903, your petition-
er fled in said Superior Court a verified petition in said ac-
tion and cross-action for a modification of the judgment there-
in by taking away from the custody of the said Grace E. Clifford
the said child and awarding the custody thereof to your petit-
ioner, and such proceedings were thereupon had that an order was
made and entered therein modifying and changing said judgment
and taking the custody of said child from said Grace E. Clifford
 and awarding the same to your petitioner until the further order
of the said Superior Court, and said order ever since has been
and still is standing and not set aside, and in full force and
effect, and under the laws of the State of California, at the 
time of the commencement of said action, and at the time of the 
entry of said judgment, and at the time of the making of the
said order, said child was a ward of said Court and under the 
control thereof; and it is provided by the laws of the said
State that said Court could at any tme after the entry of said
judgment make any order with or without notice modifyig said
judgmet as to the custody of said child.</p>
<p>X.</p>
<p>That since the said judgment of divorce, the said Grace E.
Clifford and one Herbert O. Williams above named, intermarried
in said State of California, and became and ever since have
been and now are husband and wife and evrer since their
said marriage have had in the State of California and elsewhere
and now at the town of Georgetown, in said County of King,
saod child in their custody and posession.</p>
<p>XI.</p>
<p>That on the 19th day of January, 1904, at the said town of
Georgetown, your petitioner presented to the said Herbet O.
Williams and also to the said Grace E. Williams, a copy of the
record and proceedings of the said Superior Court of said City
and County of San Francisco, in said acion and cross-section,
certified under and in pursuance of an Act of the Congress of
the United Sates in such case made and provided, and demanded
from them and eachof them the immediate delivery of the said
child to him, said petitioner, but they refused and still do 
refuse to give up said child, and said child ever since has been
and now is imprisoned and restrained of her liberty by them at 
said town of Georgettown, and that according to the best of your
petitioner's knowledge and belief, the cause of pretense of the
aforesaid confinement or restraint of the said child, Alice B.
Clifford, is that under the said judgment of said Superior Court
of said City and County of San Francisco, the custody of said
child was given to said Grace E. Clifford, now Grace E. Williams,
umtil further order of the Court, and that after she took said
child beyond the limits of said State of California, as afore-
saod, said Superior Court lost all jurisdiction to make any fur-
ther order in said action and cross-section in regard to any mod-
ification of said judgment as to the custody of said child, and
that she had the right to take said child beyond the jurisdic-
tion of the State of California without first obtaining therefor
the permission of said Court, and that after said child was
taken into said State of Washington said Herbet O. Williams
and without the knowledge or consent of said Superior Court of
said City and County of San Francisco, and without giving any
notice thereof, undertook, under the laws of the said State of
Washington, to adpot said child as husband and wife, as theor
own. And your petitioner further states that he believes and
therefore alleges, ad he is advised by counsel W. H. White, Esq.,
residing at the City of Seattle, State of Washington, and J. J. 
Burt, Esq., residing at the City and County of San Francisco,
State of California, that the said imprisonment of the said
child, Alice B, Clifford, is illegal, and that the illegality
consists in this, to-wit:-
</p>
<p>That said Superior Court of the said City and County of San
Francisco had jurisdiction under the laws of the State of Calif-
ornia, to award the custody of said child upon the fact here-
onbefore alleged until the further order of that Court, and to
thereinafter change and modify the judgment as to the custody
of said child with or without notice to any or either of the 
parties to said action, and that the said Grace E. Williams and 
Herbert O. Williams had no, nor had either of them any, right or 
power under the laws of California, to remove said child from
the State of California or change its placee of residence there-
from to any other place without the permission of said Superior
Court of said City and County of San Francisco, and that under
Art. IV, Sec 1 of the Constitution of the United States, and
Section 905 Revised statutes if the United States enacted i
pursuance thereof, full faith and credit must be given in the
State of Washington to the acts and proceedings of said Super-
ior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, and all per-
sons and courts must recognize the petitioner's right to the
custody of said child under said order in said State of Washing-
ton; as wel as under the laws of commity existing between
said State of Washington and said State of California; and that
also under the laws of Washington said attempted adpotion was
illegal and void, for the reason thar there is no provision
in the laws of Washington authorizing any person to adopt hi
or her own legitimate child by birth, and that under the laws of
the State of Washington there is no provision allowing or permit-
ing a woman who has married again to consent to or permir
the adoption of any child which she may have had by her first
husband and from whom she has been divorced, and that the con
sent given by Grace E. Williams for the adoption of said 
child and said adoption proceedings was given to its adoption
by herself and the said Herbert O. Williams, and not to the said
Herbert O. Williams, with whom she was at the time living as her
husband, alone. </p>
<p>XIII.</p>
<p>And your petitioner further states that there is danger
that the said Herbet O. Willliams and the said Grace E. Wil-
liams will take or send the said child out of the jurisdiction
of this court, from the fact that they secret;y, and without
the permission of the saodd Court in the City and County of
</p>
<p>Peter A. Clifford
Petitioner.</p>
<p>W H White
J. J. Burt,
Co Counsil.</p>
<p>ting a woman when she has married again to consent to or permit
the adoption of any child which she have had by her first
husband and from whom she has been divorced, and that the con
sent given by said Grace E. Williams for the adoption of said
child and said adoption proceedings was given to its adoption
by herself and the said Herbet O. Williams, and not to the said
Herbert O. Williams, with whom she was at the time living as her
husband, alone.</p>
<p>XII.</p>
<p>And your petitioner further states that there is danger
that the said Herbet O. Williams and the said Grace E. Wil-
liams will take or send the said child out of the jurisdiction
of this court, from the fact that they secretly, and without 
the permission of the said Court in the City and County of 
San Fracisco, and in contempt thereof, took said child be-
yond the limits of the State of California. </p>
<p>WHEREFORE, your Petitioner set up and claims, upon the fore-
going facts set out in this petition, under the said Article
IV., Section I, of the Constiution of the United States and
Section 905 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, the
right to the immediate custody of said child Alice B. Clifford
to be taken back, and restored, to the jurisdiction of the
Superior Court of City and County of San Francisco, State 
of California, and prays a writ of habeas corps directed to
the said Herbert O. Williams and Grace E. Williams commanding them to bring up the
body of the said child, Alice B. Clifford, to abide such order
as your Honor may make, and that also a warrant issue to the
marshal of the Untied States for this District commanding him
to take said child into his cusotdy and to hold the same in his
custody until the final determination of this petition.</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me
this 3rd day of June, A. D. 1904
James DeLang
Commissioner for Washington
in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>Upon reading and filing the foregoing petition, verified by
the petitioner, whereby it appears that Alice B. Clifford is
illegally imprisionmented restrained of her liberty by Herbert
O. Williams and Grace E. Williams at the town of Georgetown,
County of King, State of Washington, and stating wherein the il-
legality consists, from which it appears to me that a writ of
habeas corpus should issue;</p>
<p>IT IS ORDERED: That a writ of habeas corpus issue out of
and under the seal of the above named Circuit Court, directed to
the said Herbert O. Williams and Grace E. Williams, commanding
them and each of them to have the body of Alice B. Clifford be-
fore me on the 9th day of June A. D. 1904, at the hour
of ten o'clock A. M., at the Court room of the said Court
in the City of Seattle, State of Washington, to do and receive
what shall then and there be considered concerning the said
Alice B. Cliffordm together with the time and cause of her de-
tention, and that they have then and there the said writ.</p>
<p>It further appearing that there is good reason to believe
that said Alice B. Clifford will be carried out of and beyond
the jurisdiction of said Court, it is ordered that a warrant
issue out of and under the seal of said court to the marshal of
said District commanding him to take the said Alice B. Clifford
and to hold her in custody until the determination of said pe-
tition.</p>

R e p l y . </p>
<p>Comes now the Petitioner herein and replying to the answer
of the respondents herein, replies as follows:</p>
<p>Said Petitioner denies that by any reason of the writ of habeas
corpus in Number 41787, or of any proceedings, or of any adjudica-
tion of the Superior Court of the County of King, State of
Washington, or of any Judges thereof, referred to in the answer of
respondents, or by reason of any thingtherein, or any proceedings
between the parties hereot, or any other persons or parties, he is 
estopped from further questioning any right or rights claimed by 
said respondents, or either of them, as to the custody of said
child, Alice B. Clifford.</p>
<p>And in further reply said Petitioner avers and alleges:</p>
<p>That upon the hearing of said proceeding in said Superior
Court and before the Honorable Boyd J. Tallman, the Judge before
whom said hearing of said habeas corpus proceeding was had, said
Petitioner presented and put in evidence a copy of the judicial
records and proceedings of the Superior Court of the City
and in the notion granting the divorce referred to in his petition herein
County of San Francisco, State of California, 
authentioated a provided i Section 905 of the Revised Statutes 
of the United States, and claimed the right to the custody of
said child upon the ground that is was being imprisoned and
detained by respondents, and each of them, in violation of Article
exemplified and
IV, Section 1 of the United States and Section 905 of the Revised
Statutes of the United States, and demanded that in pursuance of
said provision of said Constitution and said provision of said
Revised Statutes if the United States, full faith and credit to
said records of said Superior Court of California should be given
by said Court of Washington and the respondents herein, and that
said child should be released from the imprisionment and detention
by said respondents, and each of them, and delivered into the
custody of your Petitioner, to be by him taken back to the juris-
diction of said Court of California; but said Superior Court of
 Washington refused, and it appears upon the face of the records and
proceedings of said Superior Court of Washington, in said habeas
corpus proceedings therein, that said Court refused, to give any
faith or credit to the records or proceedings of the said Court of
California; and your Petitioner sets up and claims under said
Article IV, Section 1, of the Constitution of the United States,
and said Section 905 of the Revised Statutes of the United States,
that said record and proceedings of said Superior Court of Wash-
ington in the application therein for a writ of habeas corpus should
be disregarded by this Court and held to be of no force or effect
whatever.
 </p>
<p>Further replying to the answer of the respondents herein, as
to the adoption of said child by proceedings in Number 5262 of
said Superior Court of the State of Washington, said Petitioner
avers and alleges that by reason of the facts set out in his
petition herein, said child at the time said adoption proceedings
were commended and had, and ever since, has been, a resident of and
at all of said time had and yet has her domicile in the State of
California, and that the facts of such residence and domicile and
her being a ward of said Superior Court of California and subject
to the control and jurisdiction thereof, were made to appear before
the said Superior Court of Washington when said proceedings for
the adoption of said child were taken and had therein, and said
domicile and said wardship of said child appear upon the face of
the records and proceedings of said Superior Court of said State of
Washington in the matter of the adoption of said child, which
consist of a petition by the respondents herein to be allowed to
adopt said child, a copy of which is hereto attached marked
"Exhibit A" and made a part hereof, a written consent to the
adoption of said child, a copt of which is hereto attached, marked
"Exhibit B" and made a part hereof, and an order for the adoption
of said child, a copy of which is attached to the answer of the
respondents herein marked "Exhibit E", and which is hereby
referred to and made a part hereof, and of them alone; but
nevertheless the said Court of Washington refused to give any
faith or credit to the said records or proceedings of said Court
of California, and made and entered said order allowing said
adoption of said child; and your Petitioner hereby sets up and
claims that under said Article IV, Section 1 of the Constitution
of the United States and Section 905 of the Revised Statutes
thereof, said order allowing said adoption is void, and of no
force or effect.</p>
<p>And further replying as to the now pending in the
Superior Court of the State of Washington in and for the County of
King to set aside said order of adoption, said Petitioner alleges
that said proceeding is nothing more than to have expunged from
the records of that Court an order claimed by said Petitioner to 
be void and of no affect, and presents to reason why this appli-
cation should be denied, abated or continued</p>
<p>And further replying to Exhibit C of respondents' answer,
reffered to and adopted by them as a portion of their answer 
herein, said petitioner denies, as alleged in Parahraph IX thereof,
that no notice whatever was served upon them, or either of them, or
that they, or either of them, received no information as to the
change of the decree of the Court of California as to this custody
of said child; and on the contrary alleges that eight days' notice of the 
motion to modify the decree was given and served upon William P.
Humphreys. Esq., who was and yet is the attorney of record for
Grace E. Williams in the action wherein said decree was made and
entered.</p>
<p>Futher replying to Paragraoh I of the affirmative defense of respondents' Exhibit C
adopted as a portion of their answer herein, said Petitioner
alleges and avers that all of thematters and things therein set up
and alleged were set upp ad alleged in the complaints in actions
brought by Grace E. Williams, as Grace E. Clifford, against your
Petitioner in the said Court of California, wherein your Petitioner
was granted a divore from her, and all of such matters and things
were adjudged and decreed by said Court against her and in favor
of your Petitioner, and are barred by the judgments therein, one
which is the judgment granting said divorce; and further
replying as to the matters and things set out in said paragraph,
said Petitioner avers and alleges that they are beyond the jurisdiction of
this Court upon this application, and are solely and exclusively
within the jurisdiction of said Superior Court of California.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, Petitioner objects to the consideration by this
Court of any of the matters or things set out in this answer of
the respondents herein, and respondents are notified hereby that
upon the calling of this matter for hearing herein Petitioner will
move the Court for judgment upon the pleadings herein, and for the
granting of the prayer of his Petition herein; and in the case of the
Court's refusal to grant said motion Petitioner will then offer
evidence in support of his Petition herein, and of this Reply.

that the custody of said child should be awarded to him by said Court.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>That thereafter such proceedings were had in such action and
cross-action that the judgment of said Court was given, made and
entered therein, denying a divorce to said Grace E. Clifford and
granting a divorce to your petitioner, and awarding the custody of
said child to Grace E. Clifford until further order of the 
Court; and providing that your petitioner should be allowed to see
said child once a week and to take the same out with him once in every
two weeks.</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>That at the time of the commencement of said action and from
thence on down and including the time of the entry of said judgment,
your petitioner, the said Grace E. Clifford and said child were all
citizens and bona fide residents of said City and County of San Fran-
cisco, in said State of California, and actually present therein,
and your petitioner and the said Grace E. Clifford had been such
citizens and residents of said City and County continuously since the
date of their said marriage, and said child had been such citizen
and resident continuously since the date of her birth, and within
the jurisdiction of said Superior Court was then and yet is a Court of record
and of superior jurisdiciton.</p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>That aftet the date of entry of said judgment by said
Superior Court, the said Grace E. Clifford continued to reside in
said City and County of San Fransisco until sometime in September,
A.D.1903, the exact time being unknown to your petitioner, and that
during said month she secretly and surreptitiously and without the
permission of said Superior Court, and in contempt thereof, and with-
out the knowledge or consent of your petitioner, took said child
out of the State of California.</p>
<p>IX.</p>
<p>That on the 27th day of November, A.D. 1903, you petitioner
filed in the Superior Court a verified petition on said action
and cross-action for a modification of the judgment therein by taking
away from the custody of said Grace E. Clifford the said child and
awarding the custody thereof to your petitioner, and such proceedings
were thereupon made had that an order was made and entered therein
modifying and changing said judgment and taking the custody of said
child from said Grace E. Clifford and awarding the same to your
petitioner until the further order of the said Superior Court, and
said order ever since has been and still is standing and not set aside
and in full force and effect, and under the laws of the State of
California, at the time of the commencement of said action and at
the time of the entry of said judgment, and at the time of the making
of said order, said child was a ward of said Court and under the
control thereof; and it is provided by the laws of the said State
that said Court could be at any time after the entry of said judg-
ment make any order with or without notice modifying said judgment
as to make the custody of said child.</p>
<p>X.</p>
<p>That since the judgment of divorce, the said Grace E.
Clifford and one Herbert O. Williams above named, intermarried in
said State of California, and became and ever since have been and
now are husband and wife, and ever since their said marriage have
had in the State of California and elsewhere and now have at the town
of Georgetown in said County of King, said child in their custody 
and possession.</p>
<p>XI.</p>
<p>That on the 19th, day of January, 1904 at the said town of
Georgetown, your petitioner presented to the said Herbert O.
O. Williams and the said Grace E. Williams a copy of the record and
proceedings of the said Superior Court of said City and County of
San Francisco, in said action and cross-action, certified under and
in pursuance of an act of the Congress of the United States, in such
case made and provided and demanded from them and each of them
immediate delivery of said child to him, said petitioner, but they
refused and still do refuse to give up said child, and said child
ever since has been and now is imprisoned and restrained of her
liberty by them at said town of Georgetown, and that according to
the best of your petitioner's knowledge and belief, the cause or pre-
tense of the aforesaid confinement or restraint of the said Alice
B. Clifford is that under the said judgment of said Superior Court
of said City and County of San Francisco, the custody of said child
was given to the said Grace E. Clifford now Grace E. Williams. until
futher order of that Court, and that after she, secretly and
surreptituously took said child beyond the limits of said State of
California, as aforesaid, said Superior Court lost all jurisdiction
to make any further order in said action or cross-action, in regard
to, in modification of said judgment, as to the custody of said child,
and that after said child was brought into the said State of Washing-
ton, said Herbert O. Williams, with the consent of said Grace E.
Williams, and without the knowledge or consent of said Superior Court
of said City and County of San Francisco, undertook, under the laws
of the said State of Washington, to adopt said child as his own. And
your petitioner further states that he is advised by counsel W. H.
White, Esq., resding at the City of Seattle, State of Washington, and
J. J. Burt, Esq.,
residing at the City and County of San Francisco, State of California,
that the said imprisonment of the said child, Alice B. Clifford, is 
illegal and that the illegality consists in this, towit:-</p>
<p>That said Superior Court of the said City and County of
San Francisco had jurisdiction to award the custody of said child,
upon the facts herein before alleged, until further order of the
Court, and to thereafter change or modify thhe judgment as to the 
custody of saaid child, with or without notice to any or either of
the parties to said action, and that under Article 4, Section I,
of the Constitution of the United States, full faith and credit must
be given in the State of Washingto to the acts and proceedings of
said Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, and all
persons and Courts must recognize the petitioner's right to the
custody of said child under said order, in said State of Washington,
as well as under the laws of the country existing between said State
of California and said State of Washington. And your petitioner
further states that there is danger that the said Herbert O. Williams
and the ssaid Grace E. Williams will take or send the said child out
of this State, from the fact that they secretly and without the per-
mission of the said Superior Court of the City and County of San
Francisco and in contempt thereof, took said child beyond the limits
of the State of California.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, your Petitioner prays a writ of habeas corpus to
bring up the body of said child, Alice B. Clifford, to abide such
order as your Honor may direct, and that also a warrant issue immedi-
ately to take said child.</p>

<p>Ex. A Con</p>
<p>Upon the reading and filing of the foregoing Petition verified
by the Petitioner, whereby it appears that Alice B. Clifford is
illegally imprisoned and restrained of her liberty by Herbert O.
Williams and Grace E. Williams, at the town of Georgetown, in the
County of King, State of Washington, and stating wherein the illegality
consists, from which is appears to me that a writ of habeas corpus 
should issue :+</p>
<p>It is ordered that a writ of habeas corpus issue out of and
under the deal of the Superior Court of the State of Washington, in
and for the County of King, directed to the said Herbert O. William
and Grace E. Williams, commanding them and each of them to have the
body of Alice B. Clifford before me May 33, 1904 at 1:30 of such day
in the Court room of said Court to do and receive what shall then
and there be considered concerning the said Alice B. Clifford, to-
gether with the time and cause of her detention, and that they have
then and there the said writ.</p>
<p>It further appearing that there is good reason to believe that
said Alice B. Clifford, will be carried out of and beyond the juris-
diction of said Court, it ordered that a warrant issue out of and
under the seal of said Court to the Sheriff of King County, com-
manding him to take the said Alice B. Clifford and to hold her in
custody until the determination of said Petition.</p>

 </p>
 <p>For a separate and affirmative defense to petitioner's petition,
 respondents allege:</p>
 <p>I.</p>
 <p>That respondent, Grace E. Williams, then Grace. E. Long, and 
 petitioner, Peter A. Clifford, then residents of San Francisco, Cali-
 fornia, were married in San Francisco, California, on or about the 17th,
 day of October, 1899; that very soon after said marriage, petitioner
 came home in a state of hopeless intoxication; that at frequent inter-
 vals thereafter, petitioner came home drunk, at which times he was 
 abusive to respondent, and caused her great pain and distress, so that
 it became impossible to longer endure his conduct, whereupon on or
 about July, 1900, said respondent left petitioner, and returned
 to her mother's home. That on or about the 5th day of August, 1900,
 after repeated promises on the part of petitioner to resume the duties
 and obligations of a husband toward said respondent, said respondent
 returned to petitioner with a view to living with him again as his 
 wife. That very soon thereafter, petitioner became abusive, commenced
 drinking and neglecting said respondent, and failed to provide for her
 comfort, and respondent, who was then an expectant mother, ws sore
 distressed; that their child, Alice B. Clifford, was born on October
 14, 1900; that thereafter petitioner refused to provide for respondent's
 comfort, or to provide her with medical attendance and neglected her
 so that on or about the day of March, 1901, said respondent was
 compelled to and did leave said petitioner and returned again to
 hermother's home, where she was provided with medical attendance and
 other comforts necessary to herself and child, That during the time
 petitioner and said respondent lived together, petitioner wholly
 failed to provide her with clothing which during all of said time was
 furnished her by her mother. That in April, 1902, said respondent
 brought an action for divorce from petitioner which resulted in a
 decree of the Superior Court of San Francisco County, California,
 dissolving the bonds of matrimony theretofore existing between said
 respondent and petitioner and awarding the sole care of custody and
 control of their infant child, Alice B. Clifford, to said respondent,
 its mother, a copy of which said decree is hereto attached marked
 "Exhibit A" and is hereby referred to and made a part of this answer.</p>
 <p>That thereafterm in or about the 15th, day of August, 1903,
 said respondent and Herbert O. Williams were intermarried in San Fran-
cisco, California, and ever since have been and now are husband and
wife. That on or about the 24th, day of September, 1903, respondents
left the State of California and came to Seattle, King County, Washington,
to make iit possible for Herbert O. Williams to enter to employ of 
his brother, Charles L. Williams, who was then and is now a prominent
contractor and builder in the City of Seattle. That since coming to
Seattle, said Herbert O. Williams has been in his brother's employ as
a carpenter and has been earning and does now earn the sun of three
dollars ($3.00) per day.</p>
<p>That thereafter, said respondents became desirous of
adopting said Alice B. Clifford as their ow child, and thereupon on
or about the 12th day of November, 1903, respondents petitioned the
Superior Court of King County, Washington, in cause Number 5262,
entitled "In the matter of the adoption of Alice B. Clifford, and infant,
by Herbert O. Williams and Grace E. Williams, his wife, "for permission
to adopt said child, Alice B. Clifford, as their own. That thereafter,
such proceedings were had the a decree of adoption was entered bu
said Superior Court of King County, Washington, adjudging that from and
after said date, said infant, Alice B. Clifford should to all legal in-
tents and purposes be the child of the petitioners, respondents herein,
Herbert O. Williams and Grace E. Williams, the same as if she had
been born to them in lawful wedlock, and that the name of said child
be changed to Alice B. Williams, a copy of which decree is hereto at-
tached and marked "exhibit B", which is hereby referred to and made
a part of this answer by virtue of which, said respondents claim the
rightful posession of said infant, Alice B. Wiliams.</p>
<p>Respondents further allege that they are amply able to 
provide a suitable home for said child and to make reasonable provision
for its future usefulness and happiness in life.</p>
<p>That respondents left the State of California not for the
purpose of evading the order of nor in contempt of any Court nor did
they leave secretly nor surreptitiously, but they came to  the State of
Washington in good faith in view of better business opportunities as
aforesaid in Seattle and for the purpose of becoming bona fide citizens
of the State of Washington. That respondents now are and expect to
remain citizens of the State of Washington.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, respondents pray that the writ of habeas corpus
issued herein may be dissolved, and that said child, Alice B. Williams,
be released from the custody of the Sheriff of King County, and returned
to the custody and keeping of respondents, Grace E. Williams and
Herbert O. Williams, and for their costs and disbursements n this
behalf expended.</p>

Williams, then Grace E. Long, and petitioner Peter A. Clifford, in-
termarried in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>2. That to said Peter A. Clifford and his then wife, Grace E.

dissolving the bonds of matrimony then and theretofore existing between said Grace E.
Clifford and Peter A. Clifford, and awarding the sole charge, con-
trol and custody of said Alice B. Clifford to respondent, Grace E.
Williams.</p>
<p>4. That subsequent to said divorce, and on or about August 15,
1903, respondents, Herbert O. Williams and Grace E. Williams, then
Grace E. Clifford, intermarried in the State of California, and
thereafter on or about the 20th day of September, 1903, said respon-
dents together with said infant, Alice B. Clifford, removed from
the State of California to the State of Washington, and thereupon
became bone fide residents of King County, Washington. </p>
<p>5. That said Alice B. Williams, then Alice B. Clifford, was in 
the care, custody and control of respondent, Grace E. Williams at the
time of her marriage with said Herbert O. Williams, and was brought

Washington, in the cause numbered 5262, entitled "In the matter of
the adoption of Alice B. Clifford, an infant, by Herbert O. Williams
and Grace E. Williams, his wife," for permission to adopt said child
under the laws of the State of Washington.</p>

jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter in the adop-
tion proceedings mentioned in paragrapg six of these findings, and

and that the cash bond, if any, in the hands of the sheriff of King
County be returned to said bondsmen.</p>
