    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Albert and Loretta Sheldon divorced in 1888. Five years later, Loretta, who had remarried, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to establish custody of their son, Hallie. Loretta claimed that the divorce settlement had not determined custody; Albert countered that the settlement had granted custody of Hallie and his brother, Olliver, to himself and custody of a third son, Walter, to Loretta. After hearing the evidence, Hallie was remanded to the custody of Albert and Loretta ordered to pay his court fees. </li>
