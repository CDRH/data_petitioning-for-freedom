<p>To the United States District Court for the Second Judicial District of Washington Territory:</p>

<p>Your petitioner Prospero Depelippes and 
Filip Perell of the Territory of Washington, complaining 
shows that they are unjustly and unlawfully detained 
and imprisoned by Lewis Byrd in the County 
Jail, at Tacoma in the Territory of Washington 
by virtue of a pretended Warrant of Commitment 
under a officer of the United States issued 
under the following circumstances:</p>

<p>Your petitioner is a common seaman 
over twenty-one years of age and prior to the 
time of the grievances herein complained of 
had been a seaman on the Bark Eldorado, 
a merchant vessel of the United States under a 
shipping contract for a voyage on said 
vessel from the port of San Francisco, in the state of 
California, to the port of Tacoma in Washington 
Territory and return; and that on the <del>30th</del> 29th day of 
June 1886, which said vessel was loading at 
the port of Tacoma, the master thereof L.S. 
Humphreys, assaulted your petitioners and 
on June 27h 1886 caused petitioners names to be entered in the log book as deserters forceably 
drove them off of said vessel, and discharged 
them from the further obligation under 
their shipping contract on said vessel, and 
then and there ordered your petitioners to 
leave said vessel, which your petitioners did 
then thereafter and on the same day said

<pb/>

L. S. Humphreys made complaint against 
your petitioner to Alexander Campbell, a 
Justice of the Peace in and for the County of 
Pierce in said Territory, upon the charge that 
your petitioners had deserted said vessel 
a certified copy of which petition is hereto attached and marked A and made a part hereof and 
thereupon said Justice of the Peace issued his 
warrant for the apprehension and arrest 
of your petitioners a certified copy of which warrant 
is hereto attached marked B and made a part hereof 
and on said 30th day of 
June 1886 they were arrested on such warrant 
and taken into custody and they have ever since 
been kept and remained in custody, and on the 
1st day of July 1886, they were taken before said 
Justice of the Peace for examination upon 
said charge of desertion from said vessel. 
Your petitioners objected to the authority of said 
Justice to try them on said charge, but their 
objection was overruled, and said Justice 
proceeded to try them, and found them guilty 
of the charge, and sentenced them to jail to 
await the departure of said vessel from the 
said Port of Tacoma, and to be given 
over to the master of said vessel upon its 
sailing from said Port of Tacoma, and 
under said sentence said petitioners are now 
confined in said County Jail.</p>

<p>And your petitioners claim that said 
Justice of the Peace had no jurisdiction or 
authority legally to try and sentence him in the 
manner and form above stated. And

<pb/>

the complaint filed and made before said 
Justice does not state an offense under 
Section <unclear>4598</unclear>, and gave said 
Justice no authority to proceed in 
said matter: and further there <del/> 
was no evidence showing that your 
petitioner had deserted from said 
vessel, that the evidence introduced 
was not taken down in writing and your 
petitioners cannot set out a copy thereof 
but the facts shown thereby are as 
herein stated</p>

<note>1832</note>

<p>Wherefore to be relieved from said unlawful 
detention and imprisonment your petitioner 
prays that a writ of Habeas Corpus to be directed 
to the said Lewis Byrd, may issue in this behalf, 
so that your petitioners may be forthwith 
brought before <del/> this court to do, submit to, and receive 
what the law may require.</p>
