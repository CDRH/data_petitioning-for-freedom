    <li>Summary of Proceedings: He was charged with the crime of receiving and aiding in the concealment of stolen property, namely, diamonds of the value of $18,000. They were taken and carried away by Sherman W. Morris (Frank Sharcliffe) and stolen from William C. Pollack. The governor of Iowa,Albert B. Cummins, ordered the extradition of Thomas Dennison from Omaha on the grounds that he was a fugitive from justice. Dennison argued that the warrants of arrest and extradition were unlawful, that he was innocent and not related to the charge referred to, and that the constitutions of the states of Iowa, Nebraska, and the United States do not allow for his extradition back to Iowa. Dennison also argued that Elmer Thomas, the respondent attorney, conspired with people for the sole purpose of bringing Dennison into disrepute. The writ of Habeas Corpus was denied, Dennison requested a new trial on July 5th, a month after the case started, and it was denied. </li>
