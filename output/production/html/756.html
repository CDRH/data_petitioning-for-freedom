    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On April 27th, 1921, Harold Savage filed for and received an order allowing for a writ of Habeas Corpus after being arrested and held in custody by Marshall Eberstein and Charles Van Dusen. In his petition Savage presented that he had been arrested on suspicion of him having committed a crime in Texas, but he had no knowledge of indictment or complaint against him in either Texas or Nebraska. It was the same day that the response of Eberstein and Van Dusen was presented in court. They presented that they had Savage in custody on the basis of an issued warrant from Nebraska charging him with being a fugitive from justice. It was also presented that there was an indictment in Texas that charged him with robbery with a firearm. It was May 1921 that the court dismissed the cause. The fate of Savage is unknown.</li>
