Dr. LP Walterhouse sworn and testified Lin at Deep Creek Falls am physician and surgeon
knew Frank Teller he is now dead  saw him in death May 31th Tuesday in the evening
he was in the yard in front of his house substantially the Diagram shown me is correct
if any difference he was not lying quite as straight as shown - about 25 to 30 feet
from door to gate about halfway between head to gate - feet 6 or 7 feet from front
door might have been nearer  did not look about the premises much  lying partly in
the right side left side of face turned up  considerable blood about the head and
face and in the ground about the body   saw gun double barrell shot gun  Just looked
at it both hammers up - Caps on - saw sprinkles of blood in the barrell - from about
where the back to the muzzle looked like it had been touched with bloody hands and
other part looked like it had been sprinkled saw a board about 1 x 4 inches  3 1/2
ft long lying near the gun shown diagram club board near the house



it was considerably bloody on the side from 6 to 8 inches near one edge in patches
as though forced in to the  about 1 in wide and foot long and on the other side some
blood did not notice anything but blood in it one spot blood in ground say 1/2 pinch
poured  in would make it two other smaller large one near the door step - could not
tell around how long there from appearance could not have been there near six hours
was there next morning  same as night before deceased had  been disturbed gun &amp; board
the same blood spots there. Taft Bothe Herrdons John Haynes and Rudolph Stoltz I think
was there Mr. Major &amp; Thompson was there - I was ordered to make an examination by
coroner  Done to - the coroner and I was engadged together we both took hold of him
and rolled him over on his back then we  to get clothes I got knife and coroner cut
the clothing in front and stripped him   In was a mark about two inches below the
left nipple ran  me  from round bruise simply destroying the testicle such as I have
seen frequently made by a spent 



bullet say 3/4 of an inch of a reddish brown color  I did not examine the clothing
there was another mark about   of the other in the shoulder just below the collar
bone almost like the  I examined his mouth and throat  on the throat large patches
of blood settled inside the skin extended about half way in color dark similar to
clodded blood just such marks as in often seen on dead people when blood settles under
the skin   skin was not apparently injured Next mark left ear considerably mutilated
and immediately above and behind a scalp wound scalp cut through as by a knife about
3/4 inch long cut it  could cut it further say two inches each way and I examined
it shown gun - says looks just like the one shown stick - that is the stick did not
find in dark immediately under the wound cut by coroner no other external mark of
violence scalp cut no other way  skull above the back of this wound was and the whole
skull above this mark was all broken and the other side was worse broken than the
side above the cut - simply pronounced it comminuted which means broken



a little pieces to remove to  they might be  - one thing  right side of the head had
no scalp head was indented the depression should amount to 1/2 or 3/4 inch and was
from 3 to thick  and  was badly    should pronounce cause of death Frank Teller produced
by blows on the head with some blunt instrument - the blows on either side of the
head would produce death - should say that death ensued confidently death would be
from concussions of the brain  in the head would not produce death one in  nearly


When I saw deceased was in Spokane County about a mile and half in Washington Territory
- I do not know whether defendant had occupied the house   up to the time of the killing
or not

X

Say wound near the head on the shoulder could have been made by spent by bulls - the
wound on the left side of head could have been produced by board shown gash could
have been produced by corner of the board There might be concussion of the brain without
fracture of the skull  I dont think there might be a depression on one side of the
skull which  slowing on  one side



X

Mutilation of left ear would probably have been made at time cut was made - did not
observe wound on right side of neck blood had settled but no abrassion of the skin
by witness was wound on left head first fingers broken - no external marks of violence
(scalp around) on right side thick blows might be  if broken and comminution produce
and skull was  no evidence of scalp wound

Re Direct
I do not think comminution could be produced by one blow on left side on right side
it might have been produced by one single blow of large round club


Re X
average thickness human skull ranges from and for 1/8 to 1/2 inch  3/8 inch would
be the average tgucjbess according to locality - thickness of skull does vary in men

ReRe Direct
Saw Mr Glispen there morning I was there also Dr Penfield and Mr Stoltz
