    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Pearl Lyles filed this petition on 22 September 1914 stating that she was being unlawfully deprived of her liberty by Sheriff McShane based on a commitment issued by the Police Magistrate on 8 August 1914. On 29 July 1914, a complaint was filed against Lyles charging her with vagrancy. She was convicted on that charge and sentenced to 90 days in the County Jail. On 7 August 1914, she appealed the judgement but was not discharged from custody. A duplicate vagrancy complaint was filed on 29 July 1914. She was tried and convicted for this duplicate complaint on 8 August 1914. The petition states that the duplicate complaint and all following proceedings were unlawful and that she was being unjustly and unlawfully deprived of her liberty. Judge James P. English commanded Sheriff McShane to bring Lyles to Court on 23 September 1914. The application for the writ was sustained and Lyles was discharged from custody.</li>
