    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On February 7, 1880, a $500 reward was posted for a man named J. Wallack in Shackleford County, Texas. He was accused of forgery. He managed to evade the authorities in Texas and escape to Columbia County, Washington state. On May 17, 1880, a man named Mr. Boyles arrived at county sheriff R.P. Steen's house to ask if he could arrest someone without a warrant. Steen said that he could, but was reluctant to. Boyles accused a newcomer in town named Julius Leiffman of stealing $30 from his brother-in-law, J.E. Jackson. Jackson later revealed that there was a $500 bounty on Leiffman's (also known as Wallack) head, and that the aptly named John G. Justice was appointed to bring the "slippery dog" back to Texas by Washington governor Elisha P. Ferry. Based on this, Steen arrested Leiffman and kept him in the county jail, although he continued to ask Boyles to file a formal complaint with the county prosecutor and to give him the papers authorizing Leiffman's arrest. From May 17 to June 6, Leiffman was incarcerated without a warrant, with Jackson only presenting some mysterious "papers" to Steen on the 6th, but disappearing soon after that. For his part, John G. Justice wanted no part in the case, as he told Boyles on June 9, 1880 that he didn't have the money to take the man back to Texas. On June 7, 1880, Leiffman filed a writ of habeus corpus against R.P. Steen for unlawfully confining him. Judge Samuel Wingard ordered him discharged from the county jail on June 9, 1880.</li>
