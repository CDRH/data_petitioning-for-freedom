<p>Territory of Washington
Second Judicial District</p>

<p>In the matter of the application of
Samuel Coulter for a writ of
Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>To the Hon R.S. Greene Judge of
the Second Judicial District of
Washington Territory</p>

<p>By law of said Judge
therefore first obtained Samuel
Coulter the Complaiant in this
case makes this his amended
complaint and alleges that he is
restrained of his liberty by an
order of arrest issued by the
District Court of Pierce County in
said Territory which said order
is now in the hand of W.C. Hawks
Deputy Sheriff of said County as
Bailiff of said Court as this
complainant is informed and
believes. That the said W.C. Hawks
is about to <unclear></unclear> said complainant
from said Second Judicial District of
said Washington Territory and
from Olympia where he now resides
to Steilacoom in said Pierce
County of said Territory.</p>

<p>Complainant alleges that said
restraint and arrest are illegal
and without authority of law, in
this; that complainant is arrested
by said Hawks for the purpose of
compelling him to appear as a witness in a
certain cause now preceding in
the District Court of the Third
Judicial District of said Territory
now sitting at said Steilacoom in said
County of Pierce. That said
complainant has never been
subpoenaed and required to appear
in said Court as a Witness in
any cause now preceding therein -
that said complainant lives without
the him its of the said Third Judicial
District and that his residence is
now there thirty miles from said
Steilacoom in said County of Pierce
where said Court is now held by
all routes of travel thereto from his
said residence. Complainant further 
says that he is the Collector of Internal
Revenues of the United States for the
District of Washington Territory,
that his office and place of
business is in Olympia in
Thurston Co. W.T. and that his
removal therefore would
seriously interfere with the
duties of his said office of
Collector of Revenue as aforesaid,
complainant says that he has been
arrested on an Order of Attachment
for failure to make <unclear></unclear> to
said Court sitting now at Steilacoom
aforesaid. Certified copies of public
records belonging to his said office
which said order is alleged to be made
by Hon O. Jacobs Judge of the
District Court of the Third Judicial
District of said Washington Territory now
holding term at Steilacoom
aforesaid. That said alleged order
was not authenticated by the Seal of
said District Court - and whether the
same was the order of said Court
Complainant says that he has no
means of knowing and does not
know.</p>

<p>Wherefore complainant prays
that your Honor may direct or be
issued a Writ of Habeas Corpus
returnable forthwith against the
said W.C. Hawks or such other
person in whose custody your
complainant may be found,
that cause may be shown, if any
exist, why he should not be
discharged and set free.</p>

<p>S. Coulter</p>

<p>Washington Territory
Thurston County ss;</p>

<p>Personally came before
me, Samuel Coulter, who being
first duly sworn says that the
facts set forth in the foregoing
complaint are true as he
believes.</p>

<p>S. Coulter</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to
before me this 24th day
of January A.D. 1872</p>

<p>J.H. Houghton
Clerk</p>
