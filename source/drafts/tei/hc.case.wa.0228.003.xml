<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p> 
<p>---oOo---</p> 
<p>In the Matter of the Petition
of EDWARD KRAUSE for a Writ
of Habeas Corpus.</p> 
<p>)()()(</p>
<p>No. 3166
Filed November 23, 1915.</p> 
<p>---oOo---</p> 
<p>J. Grattan O'Bryan, Seattle, Washington,
Kazis Krauczunas, Seattle, Washington, )) For Petitioner.</p> 
<p>Clay ALLEN, United States Attorney,
Winter S. Martin, Assistant United
States Attorney;
Seattle, Washington. )) For Respondent.</p> 
<p>NETERER, JUDGE:</p>
<p>The petitioner alleges that he is restrained of his
liberty by the United States Marshal, who holds him under an
order of removal to the United States District Court for the
Territory of Alaska;
that he was arrested upon a warrant
issued by Robert W. McClelland, United States Commissioner
for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division
upon complaint filed by the United States Distriсt Attorney
charging the petitioner with the commission of a crime with-
in the territory of Alaska in violation of Seation 1907 of
the Compiled Laws of Territory of Alaska, Codified and
Arranged by Act of Congress of August 84, 1912:that a pre-
liminary hearing was had and petitioner bound over by the
Commissioner to the grand jury at Juneau, Alaska; and further
alleges that if a crime was committed that it was not an
offense against the laws of the United States, but an offense
against the laws of the territory of Alaska.</p>
<p>On presentation of the petition an order was issued</p>
<pb></pb> 
<p>and the United States Marshal thereby directed to produce
the petitioner before the court for such disposition as may
be directed. Obedient to this order, the petitioner is pro-
duced in court.</p> 
<p>The issue presented is whether the petitioner shall
be removed to the district court of Alaska pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1014 of the Revised Statutes. Much
was said upon the argument on both sides as to the applica-
tion of the provisions of this section to the offense charg-
ed, and several citations given by the respective parties
claiming support for the positions assumed.</p> 
<p>An examination of the complaint upon which the
warrant was issued and the several provisions of the laws of
the territory of Alaska, together with the general extradi-
tion laws enacted by Congress, and expression of the courts
upon similar issues, I think clarifies the situation.</p>
<p>It is urged that Judge Hanford held a fugitive from
Alaska to be removable under the provision of this section.
This holding it was alleged was in the case of Tiberg v.
Warren<add>which was appealed to the circuit court and is reported in</add>192 Fed. 458; but an examination of the case shows
that this question was not an issue, the emphasis upon the
suggestion is placed upon the argument in the brief of the
United States District Attorney before the Circuit Court of
Appeals, in which reference was made to the application of
this section. The issue in that case was the right to extra-
dite under the provisions of Section 5278 Revised Statutes.
If Judge Hanford in that case said that an offender under
the Alaska Criminal Code, being present in this district
could be removed under Section 1014, supra., it was purely
obiter dictum.</p> 
<pb></pb> 
<p>It is fundamental that the United States courts as
such, can only entertain jurisdiction of offenses against
the United States. If the offense charged is not an offense
against the United States, this court would not have juris-
diction to try the petitioner if it had been committed with-
in this district, and that, I think, is the criterion by
which this issue must be determined. The question is not,
Has the district court of Alaska jurisdiction?, for that
court acts in a dual capacity, one in administering the laws
of the United States, and the other in administering the
local laws of the territory. The Supreme Court of the
United States, in the case of Coquitlam, 163 U.S. 346, held
that the district court of Alaska is to be regarded as the
supreme court of the territory, within the meaning of Sec-
tion 15 of the Act of March 3, 1891, and because of such
status and order of the supreme court, a decree of that court
was subject to review by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the
Ninth Circuit. Justice Harlan, in McAllister v. United
States, 141 U.S. 174, 179, said,*</p>
<p>"It is clear that the district court of Alaska 
was invested with the power of a district and cir-
cuit court of the United States, as well as with
general jurisdictions to enforce in Alaska the laws
of Oregon."</p> 
<p>which, by Section 7 of the Act of May 17, 1884, 23 Statute,
was declared to be law of Alaska so far as they were appli-
cable and not in conflict with the provisions of that act,
or of the laws of the United States, and held that a judge
of the district court of Alaska is not a judge of a court
of the United States within the generally accepted meaning
of that term.</p>
