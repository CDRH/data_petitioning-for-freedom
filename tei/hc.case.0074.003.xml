that he is illegally imprisoned and 
restrained of his liberty by James H 
Woolery chief of Seattle Police and Jam-

Seattle, in the County of King and Terri-
tory of Washington, and stating wherein 
the illegallity consists, from which it
appears to me, that a writ of 
Habeas Corpus ought to issue.</p>

Habeas Corpus issue out of and

ton Territory holding terms at Seattle,
