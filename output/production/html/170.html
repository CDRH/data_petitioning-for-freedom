    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On February 10, 1919, Ruth McLane filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming the chief of police, Marshall Eberstein, was unlawfully detaining her of her liberty. She claimed that on February 8, she was arrested and charged with being an inmate of a common and ill-governed house and with vagrancy and prostitution. She paid the bond of one hundred dollars, promising that she would appear in court on February 10, which she did, and plead not guilty. However, the courts found her guilty, sentenced her to serve ninety days in the county jail, and paid a one-hundred-dollar fine. She filed a notice of appeal and paid the four-hundred-dollar fixed bond, which the police magistrate accepted and filed. The magistrate told the chief of police and keeper of the jail that they should release McLane. Although they accepted the release, they refused to deliver up to and release her body. She remained detained at the city jail without being charged with any offense or violation. The judge accepted McLane&#x2019;s petition and filed a writ of habeas corpus; however, the outcome of this proceeding is unknown.  </li>
