In the District Court holding terms at Seattle.

In the Matter of the Application of Mary Ellen Lyts for a writ of Habeas Corpus.

On reading and filing the petition of Mary Ellen Lyts, duly signed and verefied by
her, whereby it appears that one Mar Francis Walter Lyts, a minor, is illegally imprisoned
and restrained of his liberty by one W. D. Lyts and from the custody of said Mary
Ellen Lyts, who is his mother and entitldentitled to his possession and custody; by
one W. D. Lyts, at the City of Seattle, County of King, and Territory of Washington,
and stating toherein the illegality consists, from which it appears to me that a writ
of Habeas Corpus ought to issue:

It is ordered, that a writ of Habeas Corpus issue out of and under the seal of the
District Court of the Third Judicial District holding terms at Seattle, directed to
the said W. D. Lyts, commanding him to have the body of the said Francis Walter Lyts,
a minor, before me, in the Court Room of the said Court, on the 22d day of March,
1889, at 10 o'clock A.M. of that day, to do and receive what shall then and there
be considered concerning the said Francis Walter Lyts, a minor, together with the
time and cause of his detention, and that he have then and there the said Writ.

Dated on the 21st day of March, 1889.
