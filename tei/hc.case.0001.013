X
<p>I am 21 years old I think I dont know how old my sister   my sister is <unclear>older</unclear> has been married to Teller as long as I know 4 years   while they lived together they lived there at that place - I had been living in that place about two months when Teller was killed - then there was an agreement between myself and <unclear>Teller</unclear></p>

<p>by which I was to work the place up there <del></del> arrangement included the work and use of the horses spoken of - I was <unclear></unclear> then with my sister and she <unclear></unclear> me - the working of the place - between 35 and 40 acres under cultivation - Teller had been at home prior to killing  <unclear></unclear> there day before (Monday) saw Mr Teller on Monday evening at home no one else there - Mrs Teller came there with me - he was <sic>setting</sic> in the house - <del></del> between sun down and dark - Mrs Teller returned <del></del> not long after she went there - Horses and <unclear>kitchen</unclear> joined in only rooms - I slept in the N.E. Corner of the house bed on the bed on the floor Mr Teller slept in the south west corner bed mound <del></del> a little <unclear>gun</unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> - he slept with Mary his wife - dont know which one got up first I was asleep - my bed about three feet from door heading to kitchen before I got up. I heard no conversation between Teller and wife - they had been quaralling during the night - It was about the horses he wanted to know what she came to Spokane for what business she had at Spokane and what business she had to come there that night - next morning did not hear any conversation before going to get the horses - she was in the kitchen when I spoke of getting the horses told her I would get the horses</p>

<p>5 didnt you say to her this Mary while <sic>your</sic> getting breakfast Ill go and <unclear reason="inkblot">get</unclear> horse to do thick rolling - <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> I said Ill go and get the horses. I might have said it but I dont remember it - Mr Teller was in the house when I made the remark - and was not doing anything - standing up Teller said let the horses alone he would tend to horses - he should have known for what purpose I was to get the horses - I think I have mentioned to him that night I was going to roll - was going to get them to roll the <unclear>ground</unclear> he spoke right out in a partly rough way rougher than he usually spoke. Teller done nothing then since he gave me in charge of the place 7 horses - dont hardly know <unclear></unclear> why I did not go and get them not ever having any trouble with Teller preferred not to <unclear></unclear> when Teller forbid me getting the horse - I done nothing then before Teller said she would go and get them - Teller said nothing - she did then start to get the horses dont know how long she was after them not long - dont think 10 or 15 minutes. Horses were out East of the house say 350 or 400 yards. I think she could go in that time I dont know what Teller was doing - I went out to the old house left Teller in main house - <unclear>that</unclear> to the old house fix a line on the harness - did not go for horses because I feared difficulty with Mr Teller. There has been a gun kept there prior to the killing all the time - I would know the gun   shown gun  indetified it as the one in the <unclear>evidence</unclear></p>

<p>usually kept in the door in the main <unclear></unclear> went into the kitchen - did not notice gun Monday night when I got home - I saw it Tuesday morning setting in the corner of the house - dont know whether loaded or not - If <del></del> Teller went out without the gun and turned the horses loose without the gun I do not know it - I do not know it <unclear></unclear> the second time he went out to turn the horses loose that I have spoken of - It could have happened that he went out without my knowledge - I heard Mr Teller make threats to Ms Teller when he went with the gun "if you dont have those horses loose Ill shoot you" I did not hear him threat to kill her if she did not leave the place that morning. I did at <unclear></unclear> <del></del> I was the friday before that in the house - "<del></del> If you dont leave here Ill shoot you or burn you out" I did not hear Teller say to my sister in the morning that if she did not take the clothes and go away I will burn you out or kill you some night"   I did say to my sister that Mary that I was afraid Teller would do her some harm and for her to be on her guard told her this because he had made so many threats I thought he might - I told her this from Teller threat &amp; manner that morning - when I first saw Teller with gun he was coming out of the house - Mrs Teller was coming up to the gate - held gun one hand with barrell one butt just ready to fetch it to her face</p>

<p>Witness illustrates - walked toward her carrying gun in same position - gun cocked when he came out I did not see him cock it - I know who took the gun <del></del> down - Frank Teller took it down that morning - first words I heard him are when he had the gun in his hands was "saw you tune those horses loose and leave here or I will kill you" he was about 6 or 8 feet from jer when he used those words - he continued to advance upon her when he said that - she made no reply that I heard of  to saying that he walked right up and pointed the muzzle in her face - she then knocked the gun on side and pulled the pistol and shot one shot at that time - <unclear>Hand</unclear> <unclear>with</unclear> <unclear>real</unclear> position she did not fire but think only one - he fell backwards and partly down and she turned one horse loose - he then <sic>straighted</sic> himself up and attempted to point his gun at her again - said then turn the horses loose or he would kill her - she then pushed up shot in club and hit him on the head with it two or three times - <del></del> 

In answer to a question  Is it not a fact that she shot again instead of striking   witness answer  I dont know that I seen that   In answer to the question "is it not a fact that she did not strike him until she had fired all the shots that the pistol did fir - dont know that I saw that wither

After she struck him he hardly got to his feet again when she fired last time he was coming toward her she did shoot at him after striking him with the board - she hit him two or three blows as near as 

<p><unclear>I can tell</unclear>  - all shown <unclear></unclear> after she fired the shots she did not that I saw hit him after firing the last shot - he was on his feet when she fired last shot - when she fired last shot fell over on his face toward her   Shown diagram - she <sic>was was</sic> standing about in the gate he the length of the yard from her - she did not <unclear>stand</unclear> there when she struck him

ques isnt it a fact that after she fired the first shot from the gate that he staggered back toward the middle of the yard and that when he <sic>attemted</sic> for the revolver that she advanced upon him 

ans - head downward a little - I saw where he fell after the killing the diagram represents similar place to where he fell - I think three shots in the pistol - I know where Mrs Teller got the pistol - after Teller taking the shot gun down and loading it I went to her and told her I feared he was going to do her some harm and gave her the pistol and told her to protect herself - that was in the morning just after she had started for the horses - <unclear>they</unclear> for was from him taking down the gun loading it and setting it in the corner - and from the further threats he had made for her - when she said she would go and get the horses he said nothing - I did not see Mrs Teller hit him with anything but that peice of board - she could not have hit him with anything else without <unclear></unclear> it
