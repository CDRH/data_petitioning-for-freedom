<pb/>

<p>3 That the pretended cause of the illegal restraint of his said wife of her liberty is <unclear></unclear> at the Plff <unclear>but</unclear> the Plaintiff says that he is informed and believes that his said wife is very anxious to come to him and that the real reason why the Defts restrained his said wife of her liberty is that the said William A Church may have an opportunity to violate her chastity which he has attempted to do Wherefore the Plff prays that a writ of Habeas corpus be issued forthwith and that the Defts be required to bring into the court forwith the said Maty Wells that they may be dealt with according to law and the said Maty set at liberty and for his costs and disbursement and for general <sic>relif</sic></p>
