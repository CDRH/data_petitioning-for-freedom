<p>boat to go to Osage River - up 
the River he and the capon of the 
boar quarrelled she quit &amp; started 
back to St Louis on the road home 
he was taken up <del></del> I think about
2 years ago - and lodged in jail as 
a runaway slave - I did not 
interfere and he was sold for his 
expenses until he should become 
21 years old - I dont know how 
many times he has been sold since 
1st to Lynch next to Thompson 
then to Shibly - I think these men 
all knew the boy was not a slave 
for life - Thompson &amp; Shibley knew 
it any how - Thompson <del>sold</del> bought 
him from Lynch for $100 &amp; sold him 
to Shibly as I am informed for $100 - 
I am certain Shibley knew the boys 
time was out for I told him so - 
he however claimed the boy owed him 
$120 after his time was out - that 
John - Negro never paid him anything 
and would not give him up 
until this sum was paid - 
Shibley sold him again to a man 
by the name of Denney - I think and 
he took him to Memphis &amp; sold him 
as a slave for life - he was to</p>
