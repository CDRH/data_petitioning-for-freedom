Am Cornerer of Spokane County held inquest about 1/2 mile west of Deep Creek Falls
on the body supposed to be of Frank Teller and I saw John Duggan testified before
the coroner jury then on 31st of May has heard a part of his testimony this morning
place I speak of is same place he spoke of   Shown Diagram and explained to him says
diagram substantially correct first saw deceased Wednesday June 1/87  he was lying
upon his face hands underneath him with left side of his face exposed to view  no
indications that he had been moved - nothing to indicate to that he had been moved
with  house  where he was lying path was dusty - pool of blood under head having evidently
come from  nostrils - I cant say presicely how long he had been there should say 
here he was rigid no blood flowing could not state how long since it did - saw blood
between front steps and houses one pool larger than other -  mark  shape say 3 inches
long and a little irregular notice carefully others in close proximity to the others
hand say 4 or five feet from front door - Has no blood between deceased and front
gate - I  in the examination — We remove all of his clothes



to  and examine closely for bullet wounds supposing he had been shot examining for
the benefit of the jury and a  found no bullet holes any where in the body lowest
mark of violence on the chest near the heart about size  peices dark blue looked like
he had been struck with something  -   I could not tell whether made by pistol or
not shown pistol - not a  in jury dont think   him down - was another  think somewhere
about the shoulder   with not so regular nothing serious did not examine for bullet
hole in clothing found small holes just behind right ear about midway first glancing
supposed it to be bullet hole - took knife I made  one from wound up one down took
the two flaps and decided there up &amp; back &amp; down and back so that we might examine
the skull found no trace of bullet when the skull properly smooth and intact -  Wound
evidently had been made by that slat and the ear had suffered from that blow that
was the only mark - Examined skull and found throughout comminuted by that I mean
broken in small pieces  say past upon the left side large indication could almost
put the back of your hands on left side no other mark of violence - examined nostril
mouth and eye for bullet but no mark of any whether



X 2 wounds on body might have been made by a spent bullet  Never had experience with
this hit in that location on the heart my opinion is expertly spoken does not think
if clothing on and hit sufficient to cause this mark think it would knock him down
- average thickness of an adult mans skull would say from my experience say 1/4 or
3/8 and 1/2 inch - The skull varies in thickness — there is different in thickness
in skull of different people

Re X

It would depend somewhat on the weight and momentum - supposing a man was struck sufficiently
with and in as much weighing 1/2 an ounce to produce the  described would it knock
him down - I think not it might knock him down - Death results from fracture of the
skull producing both concussion and compression of the brain
