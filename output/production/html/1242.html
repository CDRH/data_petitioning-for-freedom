    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Sing Hi filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus on October 3, 1921, claiming that the process of his jailing by Sheriff Michael L. Clark was illegal and in violation of the Fifth Amendment and Section One of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hi, described in his petition as a resident of Omaha, claimed that he was arrested on October 1, 1921 and charged with disorderly conduct in violation of the city ordinances of Omaha. Hi was then found guilty and sentenced to thirty days in the Douglas County Jail.  Hi also alleged that his detention lacked a legal basis in the laws of Nebraska, the United States, and Omaha. A judge, William A. Redick, issued a Writ of Habeas Corpus in favor of Sing Hi directed to Sheriff Clark. Clark then appeared with Sing Hi before judge A. C. Troup on October 4, 1921. The outcome of the hearing is unknown, and the petition was dismissed for want of prosecution on January 21, 1924. The fate of Sing Hi is unknown.</li>
