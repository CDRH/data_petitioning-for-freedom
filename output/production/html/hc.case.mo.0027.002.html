      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable The Judge of the 
Saint Louis <del>Criminal</del> Circuit Court</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The petition of Joseph Scheiber 
Respectfully states</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That your petitioner is a resident 
of Madison County in the State of Illinois:
That in the sixteenth day of January 1861 he 
was lawfully married in said County and 
State of Illinois to Mary Anne Green Felten—
That they cohabited together as man and 
wife in said County of Madison and State 
of Illinois until the twenty fourth day of 
February 1862 on which day the said Mary 
Anne without any cause or provocation whatsoever left the bed and board of Petitioner 
in company with on Henry Steinberg and 
both came together to the City of Saint Louis 
in the County of Saint Louis and State of 
Missouri where they have since lived together 
in open and notorious adultery and are still 
so living the said Steinberg having also a 
wife in said City from whom he has abandoned. That the said Mary Anne and 
the said Henry Steinberg also carried along 
with them a lawful child of the marriage 
between Petitioner and said Mary Anne 
said child named Edward Scheiber and 
have the same in possession in a house in 
the said City of Saint Louis which is now 
occupied by the said Mary Ann and Henry 
Petitioner further states that being the legitimate father of said child and the said mother being 
incompetent by reason of immorality and abandonment 
to take charge of said child, he your petitioner is advised 
that he is entitled to the legal possession thereof, your 
petitioner further states that the said Mary Anne refuses 
to deliver up said child and threatens to carry said child

beyond the jurisdiction of the court.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The said child having been illegally taken and being illegally 
detained and held from your petitioner he prays that a 
writ of habeas corpus may issue directed to the said Mary Anne 
Scheiber and Henry Steinberg requiring them to produce the 
body of the said Edward Scheiber and on the truth of the 
foregoing allegations appearing that the said Edward may be 
delivered over to the possession of your petitioner</p>
