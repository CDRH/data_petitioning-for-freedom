    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On June 13, 1922 Lila Murry was charged with prostitution and sentenced to be committed to the State Reformatory for Women at York, Nebraska. In her petition Murry stated that she lived in the Salvation Army Rescue Home in Omaha after becoming pregnant around January 5, 1922, and that she gave birth here and remained there until around June 13, when she was taken to the police station where she was charged with prostitution and committed to the Detention Hospital for Women in Omaha. She alleged that at the hearing no one came forth to testify against her, but that she was falsely charged with vagrancy, and that the attending physician at the Detention Hospital declared her cured from all ailments and she was pronounced released. However, she alleged that it was after this that she was ordered to be committed to State Reformatory in York, three weeks after her conviction and only after she filed for a writ of Habeas Corpus. The petition was dismissed for want of prosecution on January 21, 1924. Lila Murry's fate is unknown.</li>
