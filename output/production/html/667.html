    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Following the death of his parents when he was about ten years old, John Heo had lived with a white family away from the Indian reservations that his parents belonged to and had severed his tribal relations for nearly twenty-five years. R. H. Milroy, the Indian Agent of the Nisqually and Puyallup Agency, arrested Heo when he refused to return to the agency and cohabitate with an Indian woman, presumably his wife. Heo petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus which was granted, and the trial was heard by Judge Hoyt. Milroy argued that all Indians living in or coming to the agency were under his jurisdiction and that he was justified in requiring Heo to return to the reservation to live with his wife and child. Heo argued that because he had severed ties with his nation, had never lived on a reservation since his parents' death, and had adopted a Western lifestyle, Milroy did not have sufficient justification to arrest him. Judge Hoyt, after hearing the evidence, ruled in favor of Milroy, and Heo remained in custody. </li>
