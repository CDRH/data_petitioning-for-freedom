    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In January of 1874, Han Lee filed a petition on behalf of Seo Kim, a Chinese woman who was allegedly being held by Ah Chow in the Seattle area. Han Lee believed that Ah Chow intended to cross the border into Victoria and sell Seo Kim. It was also known that a man named Ah Ying had obtained a marriage license to marry Seo Kim, which Han Lee believed Seo Kim desired. Han Lee previously bought Seo Kim in China and believed that he was losing his property. Ah Chow denied that he was detaining Seo Kim. When ordered by the court to bring her in, he claimed that he had never held her captive nor had he any intent on selling her across the border. Even after a court order was issued, he refused to appear before Judge Orange Jacobs. The sheriff, H.G. Thornton was ordered to arrest and bring Seo Kim into custody. He brought her in but was not able to bring Ah Chow in at that time. A warrant was then issued for Ah Chow&#x2019;s arrest, but Thornton could not find him, claiming he must have been hiding out somewhere in Seattle. Seo Kim was discharged from custody and the petition was dismissed.</li>
