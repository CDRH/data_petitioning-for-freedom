    <li>Summary of Proceedings: After being ordered to be detained and deported by Commissioner of Immigration Henry M. White, Moy Hing Hun petitioned on the account that he was the lawful son of American citizen Moy You Jin, that the reason to which he was detained and his appeal denied by the Secretary of Labor is that he was accused of being a illegal Chinese Immigrant on the basis that he has a wife he married in China before coming to the United States.
Judge Cushman made the final decision that Moy Hing Hun and his witnesses failed to prove to the Secretary of Labor that Moy You Jin was his father, and thus ordered the courts to take no control.</li>
