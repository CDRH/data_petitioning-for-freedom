In obedience to the command of the within writ I have brought the persons named in
said writ viz: Ah Long, Ah Chinq, Ah Wan, Ah Fan, Ah Fat and Ah Jim before the Judge
of the above entitled Court, and as to the time and cause of their detention I do
now allege and show that said persons and each of them are Chinese persons and not
entitled to come into or enter the United States without having and presenting to
the Customs officers of the United States Certificates from the  Chinese  governments
of which they are subjects showing that they are not laborers, and that said



persons came from Brittish Columbia to Port Townsend in the United States on the 24th
day of February 1885. Without having such certificates on board a Steam vessel called
the George E. Starr, and forewant of such certificates the collector of Customs at
Port Townsend refused to permit said persons to land in the United States from said
vessel and this respondent was therefore by the master of said vessel placed in charge
of said persons until they can be returned to Brittish Columbia from whence they came.
