    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Tom Weber was an immigrant from Germany, having arrived in the United States in 1903. In 1916 Weber joined the IWW, a union organization. On February 15th, 1918, Tom Weber was arrested under a warrant issued by the U.S. Secretary of Labor, William B. Wilson, and was held for multiple months while his case was pending. The charges alleged were that he was an alien, he advocated for and taught the unlawful destruction of property, and that upon entering the country he was a likely public charge. On December 2nd, 1918, a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus was filed stating among other things that while Weber was not in favor of capitalism he did not endorse the destruction of property, he was at no time a beggar, and that a transcript of his hearing was never given to him. A return from the attorneys for the respondent states that the application does not include facts sufficient for a cause of action, does not show entitlement to relief, and that the court had no jurisdiction as the Secretary of Labor was yet to rule on the case. The fate of the petition and the bound party are unknown.</li>
