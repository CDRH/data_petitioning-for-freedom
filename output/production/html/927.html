    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In March 1919, Wendell Phillips Herrick filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus on the grounds he was being unlawfully restrained of his liberty. Herrick's wife, Ethel, alleged in the Municipal Court of Chicago that on September 10th, 1918, Wendell neglected and refused to maintain and provide for her. Herrick was charged with non-support of his wife and charged as a fugitive from justice from Illinois. The Governor of Nebraska, at the request of the Governor of Illinois, issued an order of extradition to Illinois. The amended petition alleged the extradition was illegal and the fugitive from justice claim was overcame by multiple affidavits from Herrick's colleagues in Nebraska at the Western Union Telegraph Company stating Herrick was not in Illinois at the time and did not leave the state of Nebraska during September 1918. The respondent's attorney gathered a conflicting deposition from Herrick's colleague in Illinois at the Western Union Telegraph which stated he saw Herrick in Illinois during the month of September 1918. The court allowed the petition but denied the writ of Habeas Corpus. Herrick's attorney motioned for a new trial on the grounds the judgment was contrary to both the evidence and the law, and the court erred in receiving the deposition offered by the respondent. The motion for a new trial was denied, on appeal to the Supreme Court of Nebraska, the judgment was affirmed. </li>
