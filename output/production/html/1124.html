    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Ellen Kingsley, mother of infant child, petitioned for writ of Habeas Corpus to receive custody of her child. The child was "illegitimate" and was abandoned by Kingsley on November 12th of 1881 on the sidewalk in the city of Omaha. There, the child was found by strangers and on the 25th adopted by William S. Whitman and his wife. Judge Wakeley ruled that the child was unlawfully taken, and allowed the writ, but also ruled that Kingsley is "wholly unfit to have custody" so the child is returned to the Whitman family. </li>
