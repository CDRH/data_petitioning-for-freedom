<p>To the Honorable Henry <unclear>Sluren Bury</unclear> Judge of the St Louis Law Commissioner's Court St at Chambers</p>

<p>Your Petitioner James Allison Parker, a free man of color aged about twenty two or three years would respectfully represent to your Honor that he now is confined in the Saint Louis County Jail by Rodermann the keeper of said Jail, and has been so confined since the 11th day of the present month, September, by virtue of a certain warrant order or process issued by me Peter W Johnstone, a Justice of Sant Louis County. A full and complete copy of all the papers put <unclear>on my</unclear> to the case now in the possession of said Jailor is herewith presented and made a part of this application</p>

<p>Your petitioner would further represent that said confinement is <unclear>wholy</unclear> illegal. The pretense under which your petitioner is <unclear>holden</unclear> as will appear from said copy of the commitment <unclear>re</unclear> is that he is a runaway slave whereas your petitioner alledges the fact to be that he was born and raised in the County of St Clair and State of Illinois - that he is therefore free and not a slave that his mother is <del>and always has been</del> a free woman and not a slave</p>

<p>Your petitioner therefore in view of the premises prays your honor that the States writ of Habeas Corpus may issue in his behalf forthwith directed to the said Rodermann by whom your petitioner is restrained of his liberty, commanding him to have the body of your petitioner so imprisoned together with

the cause of such imprisonment before this Hon Court without delay, to do and <unclear>se-.aue</unclear> what shall then and there be considered touching the matters herein before set forth and that no application for the relief sought for by this petitioner has been made to and refused by any court officer of officers superior to the one to whom this petitioner is presented</p>

<p>James Allison Parker by Attorney</p>
