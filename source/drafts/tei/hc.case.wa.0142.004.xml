<p>That the cause or pretext of such restraint
is as follows to wit: On the 8th day of July

and Territory one certain cow that your

Justice of the Peace and an examination
into the guilt or innocence of your
petitioner of said charge, was had on the
9th day of July A.D. 1885, that on such
examination said Justice of the Peace
held your petitioner to bail in the sum
of five hundred dollars; that your peti- </p>
<pb/>

<p>tioner was unable to give bail in said
amount, whereasupon he was committed
to the custody of said sheriff and
incarcerated in said jail.</p>

there is not probable cause for charging your
petitioner with said offense, and that said
bail is excessive.</p>

restraint is illegal and prays your honor
