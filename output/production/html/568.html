    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Mary Ann Speaks was born in Alexandria, Virginia--then the District of Columbia--around 1811. In 1836, Speaks claimed, her mother had her bound to Susan Blunt for ten years as an apprentice in housewifery. Blunt promised to free Speaks from her apprenticeship two years early if she agreed to accompany her to St. Louis, to which Speaks agreed. After Speaks had labored nearly eight years as an apprentice in housewifery, Blunt died without making a will. Her administrator, James Quisenberry, acknowledged that Speaks was a free woman, but desired that she pay two years' wages to liberate herself from the Blunt estate. When Speaks refused, Quisenberry had her jailed, and Speaks petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted. Her petition invoked the law of apprenticeship, of estates, and of servitude. After hearing the evidence, Speaks was released.</li>
