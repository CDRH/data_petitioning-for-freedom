    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 31, 1887, William Tinkham filed a complaint to the Justice of the Peace, John Mason. In this complaint, he alleged that, on August 28, David Kimble and A. B. Corriell were armed when they threatened to harm William and Annie Tinkham and to kill William. Mason ordered the sheriff to apprehend Kimble and Corriell to bring them before the court. On September 1, the sheriff apprehended Kimble and Corriell. On the same day, Mason subpoenaed the witnesses. The next day, the defendants pled not guilty and motioned to dismiss the trial, which was granted. Mason then ordered that William Tinkham be committed to the King County Jail until he paid $40.25 in court costs. William appealed this decision and petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. On September 14, Judge and Chief Justice R. A. Jones ruled that Mason had &#x201C;no jurisdiction or legal authority&#x201D; to commit William and ordered that William be released from custody.</li>
