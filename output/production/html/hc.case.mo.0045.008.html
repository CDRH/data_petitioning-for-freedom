      <p class="tei_p">James Richardson 
of the City of Cincinnati in the County and 
State aforesaid being first duly sworn 
on his oath saith: I am acquainted 
with a black man named George Washington 
Kirk, who is now said to be in jail in the 
City of St. Louis in the State of Missouri. 
And have known him ever since the year 1844. 
I am a practicing physician and was the 
family physician of Kasey Kirk, father of 
the said George Washington Kirk from the 
year 1844 to the year 1853 inclusive. The said 
George Washington Kirk is a negro is probably 
about five feet and a half in height and 
rather disposed to be corpulent. Has a kind 
of rolling walk as though he were lame. 
Has no special mark as affiant remembers 
or has noticed. Said Geo Washington 
Kirk has during the period affiant has 
known him always been received and 
reputed to be a free <del>man</del> person, and 
affiant has never heard any doubt 
expressed of his right to freedom should 
suppose him to be about twenty-two years 
of age. He always lived with his father 
whilst I knew him (from 1844 to 1853) and 
further affiant saith not.</p>
