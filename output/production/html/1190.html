    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Moses Phillips complained to the court that John Herring was a public nuisance after allegedly allowing his hogs to roam the streets. On April 27, John was found guilty and detained. On April 28, he motioned for a retrial on these grounds: new evidence, admission of illegal evidence, and the court's refusal to provide counsel. He also argued that his detention was illegal because no verdict was recorded, he was not called upon for sentencing, and there was no judgment ordering for his detention. On May 4, he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. His writ was allowed and he was discharged from custody after paying his bond on May 6.</li>
