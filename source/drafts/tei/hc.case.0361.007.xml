<p>In the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>

<p>No. 5948</p>

<p>Petition.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Lee Suey, for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>Comes now Lee Suey, by his attorney, Lucas C. Kells, and petitioning the above entitled Court for an order directing the issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus, alleges:</p>

<p>I.</p>

<p>That the petitioner is in prison, and restrained of his liberty by the United States Commissioner of Immigration, for the District of Washington, Henry M. White, or by persons acting for, through, or under him, the petitioner being confined at the detention house of the Immigration Station in the City of Seattle, County of King, and State of Washington, and within the jurisdiction of this Court.</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>Your petitioner is restrained of his liberty under the claim or charge that he is an alien, and subject of the sovereignty of China, and with the purpose and intent of deporting him to China against his Will.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>That said imprisonment, detention and restraint, and proposed action are illegal, and arise from the following facts:</p>

<p>Your petitioner is a citizen of the United States, the son of Lee Long Yuen, a Chinese merchant, and was born at</p>

<pb/>

<p>Portland, Oregon, on the 30th day of January, 1885. That some two years ago, he went to China temporarily, and returned to the Port of Seattle on the 13th day of December, 1920, but was denied admittance to the United States, and was restrained and confined as aforesaid. That a hearing was had with respect to his demand for admittance, before the officials of the Immigration Department, at said City of Seattle, on the 18th day of January 1921, whereupon said Commissioner of Immigration made a finding that your petitioner was not entitled to admission into the United States, and he accordingly issued an order for your petitioner's deportation. That your petitioner duly appealed from said finding and Order to the United States Department of Labor and Immigration and the Commissioner thereof, and on the 24th day of March, 1921, said Department and the Commissioner thereof, affirmed the decision and order of the said local Board.</p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p>That pursuant to said Finding and Order, the said Commissioner of Immigration, Henry M. White, at Seattle, Washington, or those acting for, through, or under him, continued to confine and detain your petitioner, and are about to, and will if not restrained by order of this Court deport him to China, in violation of his rights under the Treaty existing between the United States and said sovereignty of China, and under the Constituttion of the United States, and its laws and Statutes.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p>That your petitioner did not have a fair and proper hearing before the said United States Commissioner of Immigration at Seattle, or his agents or officials conducting said hearing, or upon the said appeal to the said Department of Labor, and the action of said local Board, and of the said</p>

<p>-2-</p>

<pb/>

<p>Commissioner or acting Commissioner of the United States Department of Labor was arbitrary, and with abuse of discretion, and said local hearing, and said appeal were improperly and illegally conducted, and said Findings and Orders were based upon improper evidence, and were made without due process of law. That upon said hearing, and appeal, there was admitted as evidence the testimony of witnesses taken without notice to your petitioner, and without his knowledge and when he was in no wise represented, at times and places in the absence of your petitioner, who accordingly had no chance to examine or cross examine said witnesses, and said witnesses were not present at said hearing, and your petitioner had no opportunity to meet or impeach said testimony or any part thereof, and said written testimony, and certainletters, communications and documents not introduced in connection with or as a part of the testimony of any witness at said hearing were made part of the record and said hearing, and on said appeal, and letters, communications and documents, containing material and prejudicial statement of fact by persons who were not under oath, and by persons who were not witnesses at said hearing, or at any hearing of which your petitioner or his attorneys, or any one representing him had notice or knowledge, or at which your petitioner was present, or in any wise represented, were introduced as evidence, and were made part of said record upon said hearing, and said appeal, and the findings and orders entered upon said hearing and said appeal were based upon said testimony, letters, communications and documents, and were illegally made, and were made under mistake of law, and in disregard of petitioner's rights, and contrary to uncontradicted evidence, given by disinterested witnesses, and your petitioner did not have a judicial or fair and legally conducted hearing, and accordingly</p>

<p>-3-</p>

<pb/>

<p>YOUR PETITIONER PRAYS that this Court find that he has not been accorded the rights and privileges flowing from said treaty between the United States and the sovereignty of China and the Constitution and laws and Statutes of the United States, and that said United States Commissioner of Immigration, Henry M. White, and those acting for, through, or under him be restrained from deporting your petitioner, and that he be discharged from the custody of said officials, and set at liberty.</p>
