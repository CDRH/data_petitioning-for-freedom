<p>Suit for Divorce.&#8212;Adella McHugh, of Seattle, has brought suit in the District Court holding terms at this place, against her husband, Michael McHugh, for divorce. The grounds on which the suit is brought are cruelty, abandonment and failure to provide on his part. The same woman brought suit at the last term of Court, but it was dismissed because of her refusal to insure the payment of the costs, as was required by the Court to be done.</p>
