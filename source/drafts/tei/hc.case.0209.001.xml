<p>Filed in the United States District Court</p>
<p>Western District of Washington</p>
<p>Northern Division</p>

<p>Tx</p>

<p>Dec 20 1919</p>

<p>F.M. Harshberger, Clerk</p>

<p>By S.E. Lietch Deputy</p>

<p>No. 4990.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Deportation of James Douglas, An Alien.</p>

<p>Emerson H. Carrico, Esq., attorney for Petitioner.</p>

<p>NETERER, District Judge, -----</p>

<p>Petitioner prays a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he is unlawfully detained by the Commissioner of Immigration, alleging that he came to the United States on the 20th of March, 1919, and was thereafter charged as a person likely to become a public charge at the time of his entry into the United States.</p>

<p>On the 9th of August, following, a hearing was had, "and the evidence at said hearing was thereafter submitted to the United States Department of Labor, and as a consequence of which the said Department of Labor has issued its order directing that the said James Douglas be deported from the United States to the Dominion of Canada; that the evidence adduced at said hearing, and upon which the Department of Labor acted, is wholly insufficient, and does not warrant the deportation of the said James Douglas from the United States."</p>

<p>The court's jurisdiction is limited to determine whether a fair hearing was accorded. If so, the petition must be dismissed. Chin Yow v. U.S., 208 U.S. v. Ju Toy, 198 U.S. 253. Ex Parte Moola Singh, 207 Fed. 780.</p>

<p>Upon the face of the petition, it appears that a hearing was accorded, and the charge that the testimony is insufficient does not state facts which will give the court jurisdiction, since it is not the function of the court to sit as a court of review, and weight the testimony. That the court would have come to a different conclusion upon a consideration of the testimony, is not sufficient, as is uniformly held. The Immigration Act makes the hearing before the Department of Labor final, where a fair hearing is accorded.</p>

<p>The prayer for writ is denied.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Neterer</p>
<p>Judge.</p>
