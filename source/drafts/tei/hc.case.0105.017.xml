Mr. Gorich John McCleod, Don Corcoran, Mich Eustice, 
Jas Riley &amp; Mr Bradley were there also; Mrs H. E. 
Bradley was absent during the day; but returned home 
toward evening; does not know at what time Mrs. 
Bradley retuned home He were drinking of ardent 
spirits; had some fighting late in the evening, was about 
the house all day; Saw two or three squaws and one 
Indian; did not know the Indian. Saw another 
wounded in the wood about three hundred hards from 
Bradley's home in the evening: Saw Riley 
there conversing with the Indian: did not know what 
they were talking about; understands the language, 
but paid not the least attention to what they were 
saying; was some distance off; did not see Riley 
wound the Indian. Saw Riley before the alarm; 
helped the Indian over the fense. Had no conversation 
with Riley relative to Indian being wounded at any 
time since the occurrances does not know who wounded 
the Indian; knows nothing at all about it</p>

<p>Did not know the Indian; never saw him 
to his knowledge before he saw him wounded. 
Does not know whether Riley was on horse back 
or not; did not see him with either knife or 
pistol; did not see Riley fire any shots.</p>

<p>Robert White: sworn testifies as follows. 
Knew the Indian. The Indian, who was wounded, 
was well acquainted with all the whites around; worked 
for several; was an honest industrious man. 
Reached Bradley's house about an hour before sun-down; 
John Walmsley was with him. Walmsley did not go up to the</p>



<note>906</note>

<p>house, on account of disorderly appearance of 
some men there, afterward believes he did go into 
Jas Riley bears a bad character. He is so desperate 
a man that deponent believes there are men 
who fear for their lives to testify against him. 
He has threatened Walmsley's life</p>

<p>Knows nothing about the Killing of the Indian.</p>

<p>John J Walmsley sworn testifies 
Reached H.E. Bradley's house at night, after 
sun-down; did not go up to the house for fear 
of a drunken crowd, delayed half an hour. 
White went up to the house, came back, with them 
went up &amp; shortly afterwards White went home, 
and only delayed about 3/4 of an hour.</p>

see him wounded, Saw Riley fifteen minutes 
before the Indian was wounded, saw him about 
the barn. Did not see Riley at the time of the 
row, he was not at the house.</p>

<p>Riley in a wild reckless character, and from 
his wild recless character believes there 
are men who fear to testify against him.</p>

<p>H.E Bradley Recalled. 
Heard shots about dark, Riley was at my house 
Did not see any person wound the Indian, but 
Riley acknowledged to me he killed the Indian; 
because the Indian attacked him (Riley) with 
a knife which he pulled out of his hand 
and then stabbed him. Riley said he would 
have to give something to the Indian to make 
it up. There was blood on his person.</p>

some what under the influence of liquor, watched him 
pretty sharply on account of his general bad 
character &amp; for a practice he has of getting others
