THE SALE OF BABIES

The Rt. Rev. S. Arthur Huston has discovered that some of the maternity homes for unmarried mothers in this city are selling babies. He demands that the legislature at its next session pass a law licensing such institutions, which, if there is no other way of bringing the baby traffic to an end, may be advisable. Even so it might set up another bureau and provide political jobs for more hungry applicants. Bishop Huston's discovery should not surprise everyone in this city for it is a disclosure well known to many and from time to time during the past two decades brought to the attention of church and welfare associations, without anything being done about it. And unless those who adopt these babies make a protest when an effort is being made to hold them up for the infant's board, medical attendance and legal expenses it is doubtful whether in all cases much will be done about it now.
