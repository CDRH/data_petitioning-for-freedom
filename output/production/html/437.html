    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In June 1884, John Doyle was arrested in Marion County, Washington, charged with obstructing the Union River Logging Railroad, an alleged violation of the territorial code, and jailed in Olympia. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the Marion County justice of the peace lacked the jurisdiction to try him for this offense, that he had not violated the territorial code, and that his bail was too high. He requested that his bail be lowered from $3000 to $100. After hearing the evidence, the judge ordered that Doyle's bail be lowered to $1500. Doyle made bail with the help of two sureties and was released pending his trial.</li>
