<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND LABOR
Immigration Service,</p> 
<p>No. 114/6-5</p> 
<p>Office of Inspector
Port of Spokane, Washington
February 8, 1912.</p> 
<p>Mr. Thomas Fisher,
Inspector, 
Seattle, Wash.</p>
<p>(Through Official Channels.)</p> 
<p>S i r:
I have to report that Mr. Plastino, the elder,
brought in his Declaration of Intention as requested.</p>
<p>This declaration was filed in the Superior
Court of this County June 9, 1900. The paper is made out in
the name of Meikele Plastino but is signed as Michele Plastino.
No other data is given except that he is a native of Italy.</p>
<p>Respectfully,
(Sg.) A. F. Richardson,
Chinese Inspector.</p> 
<p>Exhibit "A"</p>    
<pb></pb> 
<p>Statement of GOLDIE CARDIFF, relating to Sam Plastino
made to Inspector A.F. Richardson, at Spokane, Wash.,</p> 
<p>No. 4250-5 April 25, 1911.</p> 
<p>By Mr. Richardson: Where were you born? a BY GOLDIE CARDIFF. In
Pendelton, Oregon.</p> 
<p>Q What is your name? A Goldie Cardiff.</p> 
<p>Q How old are you? A Twenty (20), 21 in November.</p> 
<p>Q You say that you are a friend of Sam Plastino's. Now I wish
you could tell me about that; your relation with him when did
you first meet him? A Two and a half years ago. I was then on the
stage with the Herberts, a vaudeville team. I met him at a dance hall;
I met him just a few times then I didn't see him until last September
(1910).</p> 
<p>Q How was that? A I met him in a dance hall again. He asked me to go
out and I went to a noodle joint with him. He took me to the Rochester
Hotel that night; I think it was room 27 or 28; the room next to the
corner room. That was about the 13th of September, 1910. Then he
ma made a date for the next day at Kemp and Herbert's store but I didn't
see him there. The same day he tried to make a date to send me to
Seattle with him.</p> 
<p>Q Did you go? A Yes, I went that night on the Great Northern, with
Sam, at 8 PM, the train being late. When we got to Seattle we went
to the Idaho Hotel. The next night we were at the Rex Hotel. On the
Friday following he brought some short dresses to me and said he
wanted me to go into a dance hall.</p>
<p>Q Who had paid your way and you expenses to Seattle? A Sam paid for
everything.</p> 
<p>Q How about the dance hall? A Instead of taking me to the dance hall
he took me to the Dreamland and put me in a crib, #7.</p> 
<p>Q How long did you stay there? A Until the cribs were closed. I went
to work then in a saloon at #501 King St. Sam had a restaurant back
of the bar there and worked in the bar himself.</p> 
<p>Q Then were did you go? A I came back to Spokane about December 13,1910;
Sam did not come back with me. He had been with me all the time except
when he was with Ethel Richards. She had a crib #3 or 4 doors from mine
in the same crib house. I understood that Ethel came shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Q What did you do after you came back here? A I was rustling in 26 and
27 Rochester Hotel. #26 is the working room. Ethel has the same room
now. The day after Christmas we left for Seattle to the Holland Hotel
New Year's night we left Seattle for San Francisco. We changed trains
in Portland; were in Portland on New Year's eve; took the train out at
One o'clock AM. Arrived in San Francisco January 3, went to the Vendome
Hotel and staid there one night; then to the North Hotel for 5 days.
during that five days I worked in a dance hall, the New California
Dance Hall. After 5 days I went to Stockton for 4 days in a "bull
pen", then back to the same dance hall in San Francisco. Arrived at
San Francisco January 14, at 5 A.M. Policeman #515 told me about a
16 year old girl of Sam's. There were all kinds of women at the dance
<pb></pb> 
Italian, Spanish, Portugese, etc. I went to #16 Washington Alley
for a day or two, then back to the dance hall. The dance hall was
across from the Vendome, where we lived. We left March 6, Monday,
with Sam for Portland, arriving March 8, 6:30 PM and at 9 PM he left
for Spokane. I staid there and rustled in the Grand Central. He paid
for my room at the Grand Central, 3rd and Flanders. I had room 21 or
22, first floor. I think he registered me as Mrs. Adams; I know that
that was the name of my first laundry that came back. Then I went,
on March 17, 1911, to the Amsden, 3d and Jefferson, room 26. I reg-
istered there under my name, Goldie Cardiff. I was in Portland two
weeks and I came on the 11:30 PM train to Spokane</p>
<p>He had sent me a telegram asking for $20.00 on Tuesday night to
come to Portland with. The telegraph company would not let me send
it until next morning. Then he wired for me to come to Spokane on the
9 o'clock O.R.&amp;N., but I missed it and came on the N. P. I paid for
my on ticket from Portland.</p>
<p>Q What time did you get to Spokane? A At 9:35 P.M., March 22, 1911,
on Wednesday, and went to the Chicago Hotel. Somebody told him I
was in town and he came to me and we went to Oaks' for lunch. That
was the last time I gave him any money. I have been with Sam 5 or 6
nights since coming back to Spokane, at the Imperial Hotel, room 36</p>
<p>Q Who paid for the room? A He paid for the room one week and one night. I was there a month. Since that I have been here with Mr. and Mrs.
Semmes. (323 S Monroe St.)</p> 
<p>Q Now tell me about the money you gave sam? A I have given Sam every-
thing I have earned ever since September 14, 1910. In Seattle $10
a day was poor and we usually earned about $15 or $18 and I gave all
mine to Sam, except expenses. In San Francisco I didn't make much
money but what I did make above expenses I gave to him. In Portland
it was not bad. When he left me there he paid for the room rent
and I had a dollar and he gave me another one. I had $19 when I got
here and I gave him that. He has asked me for money several times
since. Sam said once in Seattle that I had made $800 for him in the
short time I had been there.</p> 
<p>Q When you left San Francisco, you had tickets to Portland? A Yes.
When we went down I had to sign my name to the ticket at Portland.</p> 
<p>Q Did sam pay for the tickets from San Francisco to Portland? A Yes.</p> 
<p>Q Did you say that Ethel was in San Francisco? A. Yes. Six months ago
she came from San Francisco. I think she has been in Spokane ever since
Christmas time.</p> 
<p>1/25     I quarreled with Sam Plastino, made up and we agreed that he would
take half and I half of my earnings.</p> 
<p>Transcript gone over by E. C. McDonald and Goldie Cardiff, May 17, 1911,
and corrected.</p> 
<p>The foregoing is a true transcript as dictated to me by Inspector
Fisher.</p> 
<p>Exhibit "B"</p>
