<p>AND FOR A FURTHER AND SEPERATE ANSWER AND RETURN TO SAID APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS,
AND FOR FURTHER RETURN TO SAID WRIT, SAID HENRY M. WHITE ALLEGES AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>That the above named petitioners are aliens and are Russians, and arrived on December 19, 1913,
or a few days prior thereto, on the Steamship "Tamba Maru", at the Port of Seattle, King County,
Washington, and made application for admission to the United States.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>That according to the law, they were held for special inquiry by the Immigrant Inspector, and a
Board of Special Inquiry, consisting of T.W. Lynch, J.E. Wilkes and A.T. White, was appointed in the
manner provided by Section 25 of the Immigration Act of February 20th, 1907, and duly convened and
met in the manner provided by the law, on December 23, 1913.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>That on December 23, 1913, after a full hearing, (a duplicate report of which appears in the
Immigration files of this cause and is marked "Exhibit A" and made a part of this Return) the Board
decided to reject the aliens on the grounds that they were persons who were likely to become public
charge, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>first: Because they are common or farm laborers and there is no work for them in the United
States.</p>
<p>second: Because they have a limited amount of money, insufficient to maintain them
<pb></pb>
during the winter.</p>
<p>third: Because there are 800-1000 Russians unemployed in Seattle, and thousands of other
nationalities in the same condition, and reports from the Interior are to the effect that the supply
of common labor is far in excess of demand.</p>
<p>fourth: That any addition to the unemployed should be guarded against, and alien laborers should
not be permitted to enter the United States at this time.</p>
<p>For a fuller statement of the reasons for the exclusion of these aliens and their subsequent
detention on this account until they are returned to their native country, we refer to the findings
of the Board of Special Inquiry, set forth in full on the last pages of Exhibition A, refered to
above.</p>
