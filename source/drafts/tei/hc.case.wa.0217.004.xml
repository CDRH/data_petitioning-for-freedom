<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION</p>
<p>IN RE THE APPLICATION OF 
NG KEW TUNG, FOR ADMISSION 
TO THE UNITED STATES. )
No. 2897.
Filed January 21, 1915.</p>
<p>APPLICATION FOR HABEAS CORPUS
WRIT DENIED.</p>
<p>Daniel Landon )
William T. Laube ) 
For Applicant</p>
<p>Clay Allen, U. S. District Atty.) For Government.
George F. Fishburne, Asst. )</p>
<p>NETERER, District Judge:</p>
<p>A Chinese boy, fifteen years of age, claiming to be the 
son of a resident Chinaman, was refused admission to the United 
States by Henry M. White, Immigration Commissioner. Appeal was 
taken to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor and the decision of 
the Commissioner affirmed. Get Tock, a Chinese merchant of Walla 
Walla, Washington, claimed to be the father of the boy, and made 
application for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging, among other 
irregularities, that the finding was not sustained by the evidence, 
and that the proceeding was not fairly conducted.</p>
<p>This court said in Ex Parte Moola Singh, et al, 207 Fed. 
708, at page 782:</p>
    <p>"The authority of the Immigration officers and 
    the jurisdiction of the courts depend upon power 
    conferred by Congress. It is a matter of legislation. 
    No discretion is vested in the courts. Congress has
    the right to legislate upon the subject; prescribe 
    rules; fix limits, and confer authority where it deems
    wise, in legislating upon the subject at hand. The 
    Supreme authority is conferred upon the Immigration
    officers. The jurisdiction of the court is limited
    to ascertaining whether the petitioners were denied 
    a hearing."</p>
<p>An examination of the record shows, to my mind, that 
the applicant was given a fair and impartial hearing. It is 
contended that the conclusion of the Immigration officers based upon 
the testimony presented, was wrong and not warranted. The court
has not the power to examine the testimony with a view of 
<fw>--1--</fw>
<pb/>
determining whether the court would arrive at the same conclusion.
That is a matter which is limited to the Immigration officers.
The court's inquiry is limited as to whether the applicant was 
accorded an impartial hearing, and the court could not inquire
into the sufficiency of probaitve facts or consider reasons for 
the conclusions reached by the Immigration officers. White v. 
Greggory, 213 Fed. 768.</p>
<p>The petition for writ is denied.</p>
