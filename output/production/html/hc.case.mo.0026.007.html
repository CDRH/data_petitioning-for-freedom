      <p class="tei_p">Whereas- Jabez Warner hath this day given information to me on 
oath supported by the oaths of E.H. Shepherd and John Finney that a 
certain female slave (as supposed) has been most inhumanly treated 
and barbarously used for some time past by a certain John Plackett &amp; his wife and that there is danger of the said slave coming to a premature death by reason of 
such usage. These are therefore to command you to cause 
the said John Plackett and           his wife to be brought 
before me or before some other competent authority to answer 
the said charges and further to be dealt with according to law</p>
