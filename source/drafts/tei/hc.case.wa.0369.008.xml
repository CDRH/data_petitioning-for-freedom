<p>United States District Court</p>
<p>Western District of Washington</p>
<p>Northern Division</p>

<p>No. 6361</p>

<p>Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of TERAMOTO SADASHIGE For WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS</p>

<p>Teramoto Sadashige, Petitioner,</p>
<p>vs.</p>
<p>T.W. Lynch, Acting Commissioner of Immigration, Respondent.</p>

<p>Comes now TERAMOTO SADASHIGE by his attorney, Winter S. Martin, and respectfully shows to the Court:</p>

<p>I.</p>

<p>That your petitioner is a citizen of the Empire of Japan, who came to the United States in the year 1911, entering at and through the Port of San Francisco; and petitioner had remained continuously in the United States until June of 1921 when he shipped on the United States Shipping Board Steamship "CROSS KEYS" as mess boy for a voyage to Japan and return, not to exceed twelve calendar months, to be discharged at a port of the United States on the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>That in the Port of Kobe, in the Empire of Japan, on July 15th, 1921, he missed his ship through no fault of his and so remained in said Kobe while the said ship "Cross Keys" sailed away for Chinese ports. That on said day he was by the master of</p>

<pb/>

<p>said ship logged as a deserter notwithstanding that in truth and in fact he was not at said time a deserter from said ship, but on the contrary had at all times a fixed purpose to return to said ship and resume his duties on board.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>That thereafter, in the month of July, your petitioner joined the ship "Cross Keys" and returned to the United States entering on the 27th of August at and through the Port of Seattle. That upon arrival at said port he was by the immigration officers of the United States, acting under the authority of Thomas W. Lynch, Acting Commissioner of Immigration at the Port of Seattle, unlawfully detained and thereafter unlawfully held and detained as a deportable alien.</p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p>That thereafter a board of special inquiry was convened by said officers, who, after hearing, denied your petitioner the right to enter the United States and ordered his deportation to the Empire of Japan. That your petitioner thereafter appealed to the Department of Labor, which appeal has been denied, and your petitioner has thereby exhausted all remedies for his release in and through the Department of Labor, Bureau of Immigration.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p>That your petitioner is, as aforesaid, under unlawful arrest and detention by said Thomas W. Lynch, Acting Commissioner of Immigration, and his deputies, who unlawfully threaten to deport your petitioner from the United States and will,if they are not restrained by order of this Honorable Court, carry said threat into execution within the next two or three days.</p>

<p>-2-</p>

<pb/>

<p>WHEREFORE your petitioner prays:</p>

<p>1. That a writ of habeas corpus may be issued to your said petitioner and that he may be discharged from said illegal restraint and unlawful arrest;</p>

<p>2. That pending a hearing upon an application for this writ of habeas corpus that said Thomas W. Lynch, Acting Commissioner of Immigration, and his deputies, be hereby enjoined and restrained from deporting your petitioner from Seattle to the Empire of Japan;</p>

<p>3. That an order to show cause issue forthwith directed to the said Thomas W. Lynch, Acting Commissioner of Immigration, requiring him to be and appear in the above entitled Court, at a time to be fixed by this Honorable Court, to show cause, if any he have, why the said writ of habeas corpus shall not be granted.</p>

<p>Sadashige Teramoto</p>
<p>Petitioner.</p>

<p>Winter S. Martin</p>
<p>Attorney for Petitioner.</p>

<p>United States of America, Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>

<p>SS</p>

<p>TERAMOTO SADASHIGE, being first duly sworn by and through an interpreter, upon his oath states:</p>

<p>That he has heard read to him this Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, and that the facts therein stated are true.</p>

<p>Sadashige, Teramoto</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 1 day of November, 1921.</p>

<p>Winter S Martin</p>
<p>Notary Public in and for the State of Washington, residing at Seattle.</p>

<pb/>

<p>Filed in the United States District Court</p>
