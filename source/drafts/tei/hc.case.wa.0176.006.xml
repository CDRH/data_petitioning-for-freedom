<p>In the District Court of the United States, In and For the
Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application 
of Marie Miler for Writ of Habeas
Corpus. } No. <del>5</del> 2457
Petiton for Habeas Corpus.</p>
<p>To the Honorable Edward E. Cushman,
Judge of the above entitled Court:</p>
<p>The petition of Marie Miler respectfully shows:</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>That she, the said Marie Miler, is a citizen of the
Empire of Austria, a duly organized Empire of Europe, with treatise
of peace, commerce and intercourse with the United States
of America.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>That on or about the 1st day of August, 1909, the petitioner 
came to the United States, where she has resided since.
That during all of said time she has conducted herself as a good citizen should do.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>That on or about the 1st day of January <add>1913,</add> more than
three years after her arrival in the United States, she was complained
against by the immigration service at Seattle, Washington,
under the direction of the Hon. Ellis DeBruler, United States
Commissioner of Immigration. That certain proceedings were
had on or about the 18th day of March, 1913, the petitioner was
ordered deported and sent from the United States of America,
all of which was without legal authority and in total disregard
of the petitioner's rights as a resident of the United States,
and without any authority vested in the Department of Immigration
to deport the petitioner.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>That at the hearing the petitioner was not <unclear>represented</unclear>

<pb/>

by counsel. That she had retained counsel before the hearing
and had paid him a reasonable and substantial fee, that he had
failed to appear and represent her at any time during the proceeding
and has not seen her or consulted with her since receiving 
his retainer from her. That she does not understand the English
language and had no opportunity of protecting or knowing what
her legal rights were. That the evidence on which she was
ordered deported was a false affidavit which the applicant had
no opportunity to controvert, owing to the fact that counsel
whom she had retained did nothing after receiving compensation
from her toward protecting her rights. That the affidavit was
made by a party with who she had been in partnership in the
City of Seattle and against who she had an motion pending for
a recievership and accounting and that the affidavit and the
charges preferred by that party and other conspirators likely
interested with him, was a conspiracy on their part to get rid
of the petitioner and acquire her property.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>That the petitioner as a citizen of the Empire of
Austria, an Empire having treatise with the United States, is
entitled to a trial in the civil and criminal courts of the
United States of America, and which she has not had, and, as
aforesaid, is about to be deported without due process of law
as well an without being given an opportunity to be heard and
based on a fraudulent conspiracy to force her out of the 
country and deprive her of her rights, both financial and 
physical.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>That your applicant and petitioner is about to be
deported on April 16th, 1913, and unless a writ of Habeas Corpus
issues she will be deported and forever barred from having a
hearing as to her legal rights, with due respect to her property
and liberty, and in futherance of the conspiracy of her 
enemies.</p>

<pb/>

<p>VII.</p>
<p>That at the present time, preparatory to having her
deported, the Hon. Ellis DeBruler, United States Commissioner
of Immigration, is unlawfully detaining, imprisoning, and confining
your said petitioner in the Dentention Station at Seattle,
Washington, and refuses to relase her from custody, all of 
which is against her will, wishes, desire and against her legal
rights.</p>
<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays that a writ of Habeas 
Corpus may be granted to the Hon. Ellis DeBruler, U.S. Commissioner
of Immigration, at Seattle, Washington, as aforesaid, 
commanding him to have the body of your petitioner, Marie Miler,
before your Honorable Court at a time and place therein to be
specified, to do an recieve what shall then and there be considered
by your Honor concerning your said petitioner, Marie
Miler, together with the time and cause of her detention and the
said writ; and that she, the said Marie Miler, your petitioner,
may be restored to her liberty.</p>
