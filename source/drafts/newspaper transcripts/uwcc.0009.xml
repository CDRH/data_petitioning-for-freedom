The U.S. District Court, Hon. Orange Jacobs presiding, closed its term Tuesday last. This has been one of the most important Courts ever held in this county, and the thanks of the whole community are due to Judge Jacobs, who at the request of the citizens came and held this term. The withholding of the common courtesies among gentlemen, which for motives best known to himself, the late Chief Justice has adopted towards Judge Jacobs, came near resulting in this term of Court being passed over without a presiding Judge. The people of this 3rd Judicial District will remember this for many years, and know how to appreciate the services of a man who deserted his post, neglected his official duties, and went off a political missionary tour to Walla Walla when he should have held Court. He alleges that he has been removed form office, and all the people say amen; but he had not been officially notified nor had his successor been officially qualified, and yet knowing of his intention to be absent from this District, he was not willing to extend the common courtesy to Judge Jacobs of asking him to hold the Court. The Grand Jury at the close of the session presented a report from which we make the following extract:

"The Grand Jury would be derelict in duty did it fail to thank the Hon. Orange Jacobs for the kind manner in which he responded to the citizens of Jefferson county in coming to hold this term of Court, saving the County and the District great expences, and in bringing the persons to trail now in confinement, does an act of justice which places the people of this District under lasting obligation; and without choosing to reflect on his predecessor, we welcome him as Chief Justice." <hi rend="italic">Message.&#8212;</hi>
