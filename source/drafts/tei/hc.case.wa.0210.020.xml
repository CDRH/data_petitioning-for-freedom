<p>No. 54690/154</p>
<p>Seattle</p>

<p>U.S. Department of Labor</p>
<p>Bureau of Immigration</p>
<p>Washington</p>

<p>December 20,1919.</p>

<p>In re KEIZO UENO (UYENO), aged ... 17-9/12</p>
<p>native of Japan and of Japanese race; single; never here before.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE ACTING SECRETARY:</p>

<p>Alien was excluded as likely to become a public charge and as a laborer without a proper passport.</p>

<p>He presented a passport which states that he was proceeding to his adopted father, According to a family record presented by alien, he is a member of the MIYABARA family but was adopted into the UENO family on December 21, 1912.</p>

<p>His adopted father is named NINOSUKE UYENO. In a deposition taken by Inspector Garrity at Los Angeles, California, the adopted father, who is the maternal uncle of appellant, admitted that when he left Japan in 1909 he proceeded to Salina Cruz, Mexico, and that he smuggled into this country from Mexico in January, 1910; also that he never had a passport entitling him to come to thiscountry, the one he had in 1909 having been limited to Mexico. While the family record shows that the adopted father married a woman on October 30, 1912, or"about when this boy (appellant) wqs adopted," 'it will be noted that this man secured the admission of a picture bride at the port of Seattle on July 30, 1918. The three classes of laborers entitled to receive passports under the President's proclamation and the "Understanding with Japan" are limited to fformer residents, " "parents, wives, or children of residents", and "settled agriculturists". The adopted father appears to be engaged as a commission merchant. The Bureau agrees with the opinion of the board that, inasmuch as appellant has no skilled trade or profession, he is properly classifiable as a laborer, and that the adopted father not being a lawfully domiciled resident of this country was not entitled to bring here an adopted son. The adopted father testified that when the Japanese Consul issued a certificate which enabled him to secure a passport for appellant said official was aware of the fact that he (deponent) had smuggled into this country. It seems clear that the passport was issued through error, since the term "residents must necessarily refer to those parents who are lawfully resident here.</p>

<p>In view of the foregoing, the Bureau resommends that the excluding decision of the board be AFFIRMED, with denial of the application for admission under bond.</p>
