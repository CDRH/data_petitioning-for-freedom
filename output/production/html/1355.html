    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On July 27, 1887, Jacob Schuman, a German immigrant, was accused of selling a pint of lager beer to A.L. McCauley. That same day, McCaulay filed a complaint with justice of the peace J.C. Dorr. After several delays, during which he was released on a $500 bond, Schuman was called in front of a grand jury and confined to the county jail on August 11, 1886. On August 16, 1886, Schuman filed a petition for a writ of habeus corpus against sheriff J.H. Hosler, stating that the law restricting liquor sales in Washington Territory, the Local Option Act, was unconstitutional, and that he had a license to sell liquor from both Columbia County and the city of Dayton. His saloon had apparently been damaged as well, and he had not been offered any compensation for this. According to The Spokesman-Review out of Spokane, judge William G. Langford agreed that Schuman's confinement was illegal, saying that the law wasn't on the books yet and that the state had an obligation to protect its licensees. The Washington Standard expressed relief that the law was ruled unconstitutional, since it had apparently proved counterproductive, "[resulting] literally in free whiskey in each precinct that voted for prohibition." </li>
