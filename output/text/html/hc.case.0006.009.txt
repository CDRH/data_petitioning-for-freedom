In the matter of the application 
of JH Sheffler and Josephine 
Shiffler for writ of Habeas Corpus 
for 
Edna Elenor Edwards otherwise 
Called Edna Elenor Montague 
a minor aged 8 years 

On reading and filing the petition 
of J H and Josephine Sheffler duly 
signed and verified whereby it 
appears that one Edna Elenore 
Edwards above named a minor 
is illegally restrained of her liberty 
by one John B Montague at 
the City of Walla Walla County of 
Walla Walla Washington Territory 
and stating wherein the illegality 
consists from which it appears to 
me that a writ of Habeas Corpus 
ought to issue

It is ordered that a writ of 
Habeas Corpus issue out of and 
under the seal of the District Court 
1st Judicial District Territory of
Washington



directed to the Sherriff of said County 
Commanding him to have the body 
of the said before him in the Court name of the said Court in the  day of Edna Elenor
Edwards 
otherwise Edna Elenor Montague 
before me at my place at Chambers in Walla 
Walla County the said court on the 11 day 
of November 1876 at 2 oclock 
PM of that day to do and 
receive what shall then and there 
be considered concerning the said 
Edna Elenore Edwards aforesaid 
to gather with the Cause of the detention
and there her have then and 
there the said writ

Dated on this 11th 
Nov 1876
