    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Sarah and Daniel Dee got divorced in February of 1901 and Sara was given sole custody of Harry Dee, their child, by Lake County in Colorado. Three years prior, Harry had been taken by force and without the consent of Sarah. Daniel took their child, Harry, and kept him hidden away in a ranch. Then Daniel relocated Harry to Leadville, Colorado and left him with Daniel&#x2019;s sister. Sarah did not have steady employment at the time and arranged with the sister, Mrs. Carr, to take care of Harry until she was able to care for him. Then she lost contact with Harry and tried to ascertain where he was located to no avail. Therefore, Sarah alleged that Harry, her child, was in the unlawful care of Mary Walters, Daniel's sister. After months of continuing the case, the case was dismissed at the costs of the relator. An Evening World-Herald article indicates that the parents reached an agreement outside of court to give custody to Sarah. </li>
