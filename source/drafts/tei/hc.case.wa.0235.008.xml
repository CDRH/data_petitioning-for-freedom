<p>IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IN AND FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA.</p>

<p>United States of America, vs. Leroy Smith, Defendant. C-287 Tucson.</p>

<p>It appearing to the Court that since the rendition of sentence and judgment in this cause, the Attorney General of the United States has revoked the designation of the New Mexico State Penitentiary at Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the place of confinement of male prisoners convicted in this court and sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary and in lieu thereof has designated the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington, and it further appearing that on the 3rd day of June, A.D., 1913, an order of this court was duly made and entered directing that all male prisoners convicted in this court and sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary, be confined and imprisoned in said United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington, and it further appearing that the defendant in this case is still in the custody of the United States Marshal for this District, awaiting delivery to a penitentiary, it is therefore ORDERED, that the place of confinement and imprisonment of the said Leroy Smith shall be the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington, instead of the New Mexico State Penitentiary at Santa Fe, New Mexico, and that said defendant be imprisoned and confined at said United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington, for the term provided in the judgment and sentence heretofore entered in this cause.</p>

<p>And it is further ordered that a certified copy of this order, together with a certified copy of the judgment and sentence herein shall be a sufficient qarrant for the United States Marshal for the District of Arizona to convey the said defendant to the said United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington, and there deliver him to the proper officers of said Penitentiary, and sufficient warrant for the proper officers of said Penitentiary, to confine and imprison the said defendant for the term specified in the said judgment and sentence.</p>

<p>Done in open Court this 8th day of June, 1916.</p>

<p>Wm. H. Sawtelle, Judge.</p>
