    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Henry Cook filed a writ on behalf of James Garfield and alleged that he was imprisoned by John Briggs and James M. Fowler for no reason and with no information. Briggs alleged that he arrested Garfield on behalf of the government in Riley County, Kansas. Briggs said that he delivered Garfield to the sheriff of Riley County upon a requisition from the Governor of Kansas and no longer had Garfield in his possession. The cause was dismissed and the fate of Garfield was not addressed. </li>
