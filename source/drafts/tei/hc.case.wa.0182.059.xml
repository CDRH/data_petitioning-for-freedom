<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Petition of
K. GREGORY, et al.,
For a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>
<p>No. 2646.
Filed Jan., 1914.</p>
<p>ON MOTION FOR DISCHARGE. Motion Granted.</p>
<p>Parker and Kalina        For Petitioners</p>
<p>Clay Allen, U.S. Attorney,
G.F. Fishburne, Assist. U.S. Atty. For Respondent.</p>
<p>NETERER, District Judge.</p>
<p>K. Gregory and seven others filed a petition praying a writ of habeas corpus alleging that they
are in good faith seeking admission into the United States to make the United States their permanent
home; that they do not come within any of the classes prohibitecd admission. A show cause order was
issued and the Commissioner of immigration made return setting forth, in substance, that the
petitioners sought admission and were held for special inquiry by the immigrant inspector and a
board of special inquiry was organized as provided by law, and:</p>
<p>"That on December 23, 1913, after a full hearing, (A duplicate report of which appears in the
immigration files of this cause and is marked "Exhibit A" and made a part of  this Return they Board
decided to reject the aliens on the ground that they were persons who were likely to become a public
charge, for the following resons:</p>
<p>first: Because they are common or farm laborers and there is no work for them in the United
States.</p>
<p>second; Because they have but a limited amount of money, insufficient to maintain them during the
winter.</p>
<p>third: Because there are 800 to 1000 Russians unemployed in Seattle, and thousands of other
nationalities in the same condition, and reports from the Interior are to the effect that the supply
of common labor is far in excess of demand.</p>
<p>fourth: That any addition to the unemployed should be gaurded against, and alien laborers should
not be permitted to enter the United States at this time." <add>That the petitioners appealed to the
Secretary of Labor who affirmed the decision of the board of special inquiry</add>.</p>
<p>The petitioners move that they be forthwith discharged for the reasons:</p>
<p>"(1) That the return shows that they are detained and restrained of their liberty for unlawful
reasons and contrary to the statutes in such chases made and provided; (2) that the Special
examining board and the Secretary of Commerce and Labor and said Commissioner exceeded their
authority and jurisdiction; (3) that the alleged reasons for detainging said petitioners are
<pb></pb>
irrelevant, immaterial and not sipported by evidence, and are frivolous and sham; (4) that said
petitioners had all the personal qualificatiosn required of them by the statutes, and to entitle
them to immediate and unconditional discharge."</p>
<p>This court held in In re Moola Singh, 207 Fed. 780, that the jurisdiction of this court is
limited to ascertaining whether the petitioners were denied a hearing, and if a hearing has been
accorded, the court is precluded from a re-examination of the issue presented merely because it is
contended that the conclusion of the immigration officers based upon the testimony was wrong. In the
Moola Singh case a trial was had, and the conclusion of the examining board was that the aliens be
excluded from admission under the laws of the United States. The conclusion of the board found
delinquency in the personal qualifications of the applicants which brought them within the exclusion
provisions of the act. This court cannot examine into the testimony produced upon the hearing in
this case beofre the special examining board, nor enter upon a re-examination of the facts. This
court is bound by the facts as found by the board of special inquiry. Do the facts as found bring
the petitioners within the provisions of the exclusion provisions of the act? Are the petitioners
qualified to enter under the findings of the baord, and is the act of the board beyond its
jurisdiction, and does the personal candition of the applicants, as found, preclude their exclusion.</p>
