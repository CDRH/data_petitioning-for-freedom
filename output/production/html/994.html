    <li>Summary of Proceedings: The justice of the peace, D. S. Smith, ordered Hughes and his fellow petitioners to pay a peace bond of $500 ($300 for the other petitioners) to maintain the peace with Josiah Gellerson and the community as a whole. The petitioners were jailed indefinitely until they paid the bond, so they filed for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that they never threatened to destroy the property of Gellerson. The writ was issued by Judge Lewis. </li>
