    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 23rd, 1916, Jesse Fowler, Mamie Cole, and Arthur Haynes were arraigned and tried by the police magistrate for vagrancy in the Police Court of the City of Omaha. On August 24th, 1916, with the help of their lawyer Daniel H. Horrigan, Jesse Fowler and Mamie Cole filed a Writ of Habeas Corpus against Sheriff F. J. McShane Jr..They claimed the complaint they received was not sworn to by the city prosecutor or signed by police magistrate and that the police magistrate did not have jurisdiction to try and sentence people, so therefore all proceedings were then unlawful and void.
On August 24th, 1916, Judge Willis G. Sears allowed the petitioner's Writ of Habeas Corpus and ordered Jess Fowler, Mamie Cole, and F. J. McShane Jr. to appear in court the next day. On August 28th, 1916, Judge A. C. Troup ruled in favor of the petitioners, stating that they were unlawfully deprived of their liberty and ordered their release.</li>
