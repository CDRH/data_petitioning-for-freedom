the libellants entered on board and into the <sic>servise</sic> of the said vessel in the <sic>capasity</sic> and at the monthly wages aforesaid on or about the said 8th day of April AD 1875 and the said vessel proseeded to sea with the said libellants on board without their signing any shipping <sic>artisle</sic> or agreement in writing or in print whatever</p>

<p>Fourth That all and singular the premises are true</p>

<p>Wherefore libellants pray that prosess in due form of law may issue against the said vessel her tackle apparel and furniture and that this honorable court will pronounce  for the wages aforesaid and <sic>desred</sic> the sum to be fair with costs, and for <sic>sush</sic> other and further relif and redress as the right and justice may appertain and as the Court is competent to give in the premises</p>
