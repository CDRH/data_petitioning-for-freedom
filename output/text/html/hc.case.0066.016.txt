I H. G. Thornton, the specially deputis officer to whom the within writ was directed
for service state that I have been unable to find Ah Chow to whom said writ is directed
and upon whom it was to be ordered, although I have made diligent search for him I
further state from inspection and belief that the said Ah Chow has absconded from
the County or conceals himself so that no service can be issued upon him of this writ
