    <li>Summary of Proceedings: E. A. Bullock made a complaint to C. F. Eiseley, which stated that Frank E. Waring committed the crime of forgery. John J. Donahue and Patrick Havey, sheriff and jailor respectively, were told to arrest him. J. L. Greene, the superintendent of the Nebraska Hospital for the insane alleged that Frank E. Waring was adjudged insane by the board of commissioners of insanity and was committed to the custody of the hospital. Green filed a case to gain custody of Waring back into the hospital. On April 20, 1903, Waring was committed to J. L. Green and the Nebraska Hospital for the insane.</li>
