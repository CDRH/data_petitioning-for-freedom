    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Robert Geslin filed for a petition of Habeas Corpus December of 1921 on the grounds that he was being held in custody and deprived of his liberty by William M. Basher, an immigration inspector, in Douglas County, Nebraska. Basher was holding Geslin in custody under the claim that he was an alien. Geslin, having been born in the Empire of Russia, made his way to New York in 1920 where he applied for and was given papers of naturalization and after had and was residing in Lincoln, Nebraska. It was November of the following year that he was arrested, charged and given a hearing. After the hearing, he was informed that there would be nothing more of the matter until he received information that Brasher had a warrant for deportation. When Brasher appeared in court he denied all allegations and asked that Geslin be remanded for deportation. It was January 1925 that in trial it was decided the writ of Habeas Corpus be allowed and Geslin be released from custody. </li>
