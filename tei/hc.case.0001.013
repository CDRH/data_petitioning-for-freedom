<p>I am 21 years old I think I dont know how old my sister   my sister is <unclear></unclear> has been married to Teller as <unclear>long</unclear> as I know 4 years   while they <unclear>had</unclear> to <unclear></unclear> they <unclear></unclear> then at that <unclear></unclear> - I had been living in that place about two months when Teller was killed - then <unclear>was</unclear> an agreement between myself and</p>

<p>by which I was to work the place up there <del></del> <unclear>arrangement</unclear> <unclear>inclu..</unclear> the word and use of the horse spoken of - I was <unclear></unclear> there was my sister and she sleep me - the <unclear>worsing</unclear> of the place - between 3 <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> and <unclear></unclear> - Teller had been at home prior to killing  <unclear></unclear> there day before (<unclear></unclear>) saw Mr Teller on Monday evening at home no one else there - Mrs Teller came there with me - he was setting in the house - <del></del> between sun down and dark - Mrs Teller returned <del></del> not long after she went there - Horses and <unclear>kitchen</unclear> joined in one rooms - I slept in the N.E. Corner of the house bed on the <unclear></unclear> Mr Teller slept in the south west corner by a <unclear>mound</unclear> <del></del> a little <unclear>gun</unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> - he slept with Mary his wife - dont know which one got up first I was asleep - my <unclear>bed</unclear> about three <unclear></unclear> from door heading to kithen before I got up. I heard no conversation between Teller <unclear></unclear> - they had been quaralling during the night - It was about the horses he wanted to know what she came to Spokane for what business she had at Spokane and what business she had to come there that night - next morning did not hear any conversation before going to get the horses - she was in the kitchen when I spoke of getting the horses told her I would get the horses</p>

<p>5 didnt you say to her this Mary while <sic>your</sic> getting <unclear></unclear> Ill go and the horse to do thick rolling - <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> I said Ill go and get the horses. I might have said it but I dont remember it - Mr Teller was in the house when I made the remark - and was not doing anything - standing up Teller said let the horses alone <unclear></unclear> tend to horses - he should have known for what purpose I was to get the horses - I think I have maintained <unclear></unclear> that night I was going to roll - was going to get them to roll the <unclear></unclear> he spoke right out in a partly rough way rougher than he usually spoke. Teller done nothing then <unclear></unclear> he gave me in charge of the place 7 horses - dont <unclear></unclear> know <unclear></unclear> why I did not go an get them not <unclear></unclear> having any trouble with Teller <unclear>preferred</unclear> not to <unclear></unclear> when Teller forbid me getting the horse - I done nothing then <unclear></unclear> Teller said she would go and get them - Teller said nothing - she did then start to get the horses dont know how long she was after them not long - dont think 10 or 15 minutes. Horses were out East of the house say 350 or 400 yards. I think she could go in that time I dont know what Teller was doing - I went out to the old house left Teller in <unclear>new</unclear> house - that to the old house <unclear></unclear> a <unclear></unclear> on the harness - did not go for horses I <unclear>feared</unclear> <unclear>differently</unclear> with Mr Teller. There has been a gun kept there prior to the killing all the time - I would know the gun   shown gun  indetified it as the weapon <unclear></unclear></p>

<p>usually kept in the door in the <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> would into the kitchen - did not notice gun <unclear></unclear> night when I got home - I saw it Tuesday morning setting in the corner of the house - dont know whether loaded or not - If <del></del> Teller went out without the gun and turned the horses loose without the gun I do not know it - I do not know <unclear></unclear> the second time he went out to <unclear>let</unclear> the horses loose that I have spoken of - It could have happened that he went out without my knowledge - I heard Mr Teller make threats to Ms Teller when he went with the gun "if you dont have those horses loose Ill shoot you" I did not hear him threat to kill her if she did not leave the place that morning. I did at <unclear></unclear> <del></del> I has the for day before that in the house - "<del></del> If you dont leave here Ill shoot you or burn you out" I did not hear Teller say to my sister in the morning that if she did not take the clothes and go away I will burn you out or kill you some night"   I did say to my sister that Mary that I was afraid Teller would do her some harm and for her to be in her <unclear></unclear> told her this because he had made so many threats I thought he might - I told her this from Teller <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> that morning - when I first saw Teller with gun he was coming out of the house - Mrs Teller was coming up to the gate - held gun one hand with barrell one butt just <unclear></unclear> to fetch it to her face</p>

<p>Witness illustrates - walked toward her carrying gun in same position - gun cocked when he came out I did not see him cock it - I know who took the gun <del></del> down - Frank Teller took it down that morning - first words I heard him are when he had the gun in his hands was "saw you tune those horses loose and leave here or I will kill you" he was about 6 or 8 feet from jer when he used those words - he continued to advance upon her when he said that - she made no reply that I heard of  to saying that he walked right up and pointed the muzzle in her face - she then knocked the gun on side and pulled the pistol and shot one shot at that time - <unclear></unclear> <unclear>not or with</unclear> <unclear></unclear> position she did not <unclear></unclear> but think only one - he fell backwards and partly down and she turned one horse loose - he then <unclear>laughed or</unclear> himself up and attempted to point his gun at her again - said then turn the horses loose or he would kill her - she then pushed up shot in club and hit him on the head with it two or three times - <del></del> 

In answer to a question  Is it not a fact that she shot again instead of striking   witness answer  I dont know that I seen that   In answer to the question "is it not a fact that she did not strike him until she had fired all the shots that the pistol did fir - dont know that I saw that wither

After she struck him he hardly got to his feet again when she fired last time he was coming toward her she did shoot at him after striking him with the board - she hit him two or three blows <unclear></unclear>
