I am a Neighbor to the Tellers 3 years They had some family trouble - Teller has been
away from house some time year ago last winter he was away all winter - seemed as
though had quarrelled and made up - Mrs Teller left him once and worked at a Saw Mill
and it was then made up after this - I dont know that Teller had been living at house
at all just before the killing  Think he was working for a man near Grub Creek - I
saw him at Deep Creek he told me he had been at home saw him on Monday before killing
Friday from noon before the killing saw him and at Deep Creek Falls

Re Direct

Guards section between our house and Teller - defendant was residing there prior to
the killing also her brother John - saw her there on Thursday which was just before
the sheriff told me of Teller and saw her on Sunday after that showing prod to which
Teller me  my Friday morning think she has lived at the house 



all Spring - know her brother John saw him at DC F when arrested must have been close
to 3 o'clock

Seemed as though had been some trouble between the Tellers

Re X

Saw and had a very little talk with Mrs. Teller on the Tuesday before Mrs. Teller
said Frank  has threatened me wants me to leave the place or he will kill me and burn
the house down.  She asked me what she should do about the property when I saw her
then she was kind of quiet and as though mad and I said Mary you look like the last
rose of summer took place at Mr. Duggan house dont know where Teller was at that time
