24th day if August in the year 1895 at Vernon in the presence and 
hearing of John McKinnon who stands charged that upon or about
the 18th day of August instant, at Vernon in the District of Yale
for neat cattle of the goods and chattels of C. O'Keefe unlawfully 
did steal.</p>

<pb/>

<p>Harold R. Parke, sworn, saith:</p>

<p>I am Provincial Constable residing at the City of 
Vernon.</p>

<p>I produce a Hide-- On the evening of the twenty-third
of August instant I s w a portion of a hide projecting from under
John McKinnon's stable, the accused. I told Charles Emerson of the
hide being there.</p>

<p>The following morning Charles Emerson brought me a 
piece of paper with a drawing of the brand which he said was on
the hide I had told him about. I thought that it was Mrs. O'Keefe's
brand and told him to take O'Keefe with him to see the hide. A 
short time afterwards he, Charles Emerson and O'Keefe returned
bringing the hide produced with them (Exhibit A). Mr. O'Keefe
identified the brand on the hide produced as his brand, Mr. O'Keefe
then laid an information against John McKinnon and I arrested the
accused on the twenty fourth of August instant. After the arrest
I searched under McKinnon's stables and found two more hides. The
hide about to be produced is a reddish colored hide -- he ear cut
off -- The hide produced ("Exhibit B") I took out from under the
accused stables on the afternoon of the 24th day of August instant-
this hide has an indistinct brand on the left ribs resempling Mr.
O'Keefe's brand -- after that, still on the 24th day of August
instant, I went to the slaughter house where McKinnon, the accused
keeps his hides, and found one black hide branded with a triangle
on the left hip high up near the back bone, the top of the left
ear was cut off. I also found a small roan hide in the same place
with no brand on it that I could see, I also found a large red
and white hide with the ears cut off and left leg cutt off. These
last mentioned hides are now in my possession. On the 24th of August I also found in a cutter in the shed of 
<unclear>McKinnon</unclear></p>

<pb/>

<p>McKinnons a black calf without brand and head cut off -- I could 
discover no brands on the hides mentioned with the leg cut off.</p>

<p>Cross examined by Mr. Culey.</p>

<p>The brand on ("Exhibit B") resemples <gap></gap> this is on
the left ribs -- I believe this is a brand. When I saw a hide projecting
from under the stable I was climbing over the fence and not
more than ten feet way-- the floor of the stable was about two
feet from the ground. That side was hence all open. </p>

<p>From what I knew of Charles Emerson's occupation I
told him of the hide being in the stables.</p>

<p>It was about six o'clock in the evening when I saw the
hide. -- about an hour or an hour and one-half afterwards I told
Emerson. Charles Emerson told me that he was a detective. He has no
done detective wrok for me before.</p>

<p>I have not got the paper emerson showed me. I never had
it in my possession. The hide (Exhibit A) when I saw it might have
been eight or ten days killed. The reason I told Emerson of the
projecting hide was that there was a reward of $500. offered for 
convictions of cattle stealing. I did not wish to work for a reward
as I am paid by the Government for my work.</p>

<p>I did not notice any other brands besides the one
mentioned, on the black hide found at the slaughter house. I think
I have seen Charles Emerson around here three or four months.</p>

<ab>By the Bench.</ab>

<p>The front of the stable is level with the ground and 
the side the manure heap fills up, the third side is blocked up
by a vehicle shed and the side where I saw the hide projecting is
about eighteen inches from the Govement fence.</p>

<p>The Government fence separates the building from the
Gaul and Government Building.</p>

<pb/>

<p>During the last week I have croseed the fence three times a day. I
always cross that way when I want to get meals for prisoners.</p>

<p>This place is in full view of any one crossing the fence 
but one cannot see anything under the stable without getting down
and looking.</p>

<p>Sometimes for months I never cross at all. The fence
is so close to the stables that anyone could see nothing under the 
stable without squeezing between the fence and building and getting
down to look.</p>

<p>When I first <del/> saw the hide the greater porion was
under the stable and the rest looked as if it had been pulled out
by a dog.</p>

<p>When I first spoke to Charles Emerson I intended to
continue the investifation myself. I used Emerson as a means.</p>

<p>I dont know of my own knowledge that the hide brought
by Mr? O'Keefe and Emerson on Saturday to me was the same hide
I saw on Friday morning.</p>

<p>I have seen Charles Emerson behind the Counter in
Shooke's fruit store apparently working. I dont know of any other
occupation.</p>

<ab>H.R.Parke.</ab>

<pb/>

<p>Charles Emerson, sworn saith: I am a Lathier.</p>

<p>Last Friday Mr. Parke informed me of a hide being under
McKinnon's stables he said I might look after it. I told him I 
would. About nine o'clock that night I went to McKinnons stable
I found the hide, (Exhibit A) there under the stable. The side of
the stable facing the fence is open from the ground. The fence is
about two feet from the stables. The fence is over four feet
high. The hide was under the stable all but one corner. I would
not have noticed it if I had not bee looking for it. I pulled the
hide out and started toward the sidewalk with it in my hand
In the morning of the 24th instant I examined the hide. after I
scraped off the hair I found a brand on it similar to the
There was an ear mark one ear was split. The other ear was not on
the hide. I left the hide in the brush behind the victoria stable
about five hours afterwards I took Mr. O'Keefe to see it. It was
in the same place where I had left it. I showed it to Mr. O'Keefe.
He said he would bring his rig and take the hide to the Jout House.
He did so. I saw the hide again on the 24th and again on the 25th.
I brought an hide into court this morning.</p>

<p>Const. Parke and myself found some more hides in a shed at 
McKinnons slaughter house between Vernon and Okanogah Lake. We fon
three hides. I found a brand on the Balck hide it was a triangle
The second hide was a roan hide. Could see not brand on it. The
third hide was a red and white. Could not see any brand or Marks
on it. These hides were sent to the Government house in an express
wagon. When I showed Mr. O'Keefe the hide exhibit A he said it was
his brand on it.</p>

<p>xd. When parke met me, he said good night. Then 
he said there was a hide under McKinnons stables. He said it might</p>

<pb/>

<p>pay me to look after it. I asked him whereabouts was under the
stable. He told me that it was near the southwest corner. It was
between half past six and seven or later. After I left Parke I
walked around town. I was in Hurks Barber shop part of the time. 
I did not say anything to Murk about what Parke had told me. I 
have been staying at Murks during the past week. I was also
in Davidsons fruit store and was about the street the rest of the
time until nine o'clock. It was dark at 9 o'clock just after
Parke informed me I walked past the place and saw that the hide
was there. When I went at nine o'clock for the hide I left it half 
way between the sidewalk and McKinnons shop. I wnet to the side-
walk as I saw a man there watching me. it was Mr. Birnie. He asked
me what I was doing there. I told him that I was taking a hide
out of there. I intended taking the hide to the brush. I was
scared the man on the sidewalk might say something about it. It 
was old Mr. Birnie-- after I spoke with Birnie I went back to the
hide and took it to the brush. I did not meet anyone else. I did
not tell anyone else that night what I had been doing. the hide
was not tied up. I saw Mr. Haron that night. he is night watchman. I
told him about the hide early Saturday morning. I told him about
taking the hide and asked him to come and see it after daylight. I
did not tell him what brand was on it as I had not seen it there. I 
told him I had not seen it there. I told him that I had left it
in the brush. Last a Wednesday night I slept either at Murks or
my own shack. I think I slept at Murks on Tuesday night. I remember
now I slept at Murks up to Friday night. I know a Half Breed named
Frank Pete. I saw him the say Smart was tried. in the afternoon.
it was nearly six. I saw him afterwards about eight o'clock, he
called me out of Davidsons. He was riding, he wanted me on business
he told me that there was counterfeit money among the six here.
He said he would be in Friday nights again. I saw him about four</p>

<pb/>

<p>o'clock on Friday. I am a detective. I have had experience on one
occasion. I have done detective work in the state before. I joined
the detective association. I have been in Vernon two years. I have
worked for Mr. Crowell. I have worked in Kelowna and Enderby.
I worked for Judge Spinks. I have had no permenent occupation
during the two years. there has not been enough lathing. I do not
know a siwash or half breed named Victor. I saw some siwashes on 
Friday night. The only one I saw at the Coral was Pete. There
were some whitemen strolling around. I took a walk with a white man
at the corral on Friday night. He left me with Pete, I saw Pete
twice that day. I did not say anything to Pete or Victor or any
siwash about the McKinnon business. </p>

<ab>Edward Tronson sworn saith:</ab>

<p>I do not think I brought a calf to McKinnons shop.
I was in Vernon on Thursday last. Aleck an Indain boy was with
me we came in a wagon there was no calf in the wagon.</p>

<ab>Edward Tronson.</ab>

<p>Samuel Bell sworn saith: I am a Butcher I work for John McKinnon
I remember last thursday I received a small black calf from
Edward Trosson, the last witness on that night at McKinnons shop
I have once or twice helped him to kill. I have worked for him for
six months. I generally do the killing for McKinnon, Once or twice
I got Joe Mosgrove to help me, I find the cattle in the corral
at the slaughter house and I kill them. McKinnon generally puts
the cattle in the corral. I put the hides in the hide house and sat
them. I killed up to about a months or six weeks back. McKinnon has
done the killing since then. I have helped him once or twice.
Joe Mosgrove and Jerry Mosgrove have helped to kill. We have very
little veal in the shop. The last was on Thursday. There have been
several calves brought into McKinnons shop since I have worked there
McKinnon brought them in except one I got from Sluckey and one I 
got from Parrette. I do not know where McKinnon got them. I do not 
know exactly the number of cattle used by McKinnon since I have 
been with him. We got twenty four or twenty six from Frank Young
four from Quin Falkener and four or five from White valley?. These
are all the cattle that I know of being purchased. I commenced to
kill Frank Youngs cattle as soon as they were driven over here. I 
did not notice the brands of any cattle killed by me. I did not
bring any hides from the slaughter house up here. I never knew of
<unclear/></p>

<pb/>

<p>McKinnon's doing so. I received the calf from Edward Tronson at
the Butcher shop at 9 o'clock on Thursday night. he took it out of
the wagon. he did not say where he had got it. An Indian boy was 
with him. McKinnon always sent me down to kill the cattle were in
the corrals the corals are on Tronsons ranch. Nomone kills there
but McKinnon. He has the use of them. To my knowledge McKinnon puts
the cattle into the corral where when I kill, I kill what I think
is required for the shop. I leave what I do not want in the corral. McKinnon uses the hide house. It is used for putting the
hides in after they are killed. I killed with McKinnon on the 23rd inst. I helped McKinnon kill on the 14th inst. one Beef. It was a
red and white animal. I did not notice any brands. The animal was a heifer. I do not know where she came from. The skin was put in
the hide. It was a black animal killed on the 23rd it had a triangle 
brand near the rump bone. That skin was also put in the hide
house. I do not remember when we last killed before the 14th. We
never kill at the shop, never have any skins at the shop except the
veal skins. I have not noticed any hides about the premises. I did
not know of any hides being under the stables. I sleep in the
shop. McKinnon does not sleep in the shop.</p>

<p>xd. I am not familiar with brands, do not as a 
rule take notice of them. The hide house is not kept locked, anybody
can go in that likes, the stable is not fenced in, anyone can go
in there that likes. I could not say whether an average man could
go easily between the fence and stable. I never tried to get through
Anone passing the corral can see if there are cattle there.</p>

<ab>S. C. Bell.</ab> 

<pb/>

<p>Cornelius O'Keef sworn, saith: I am a framer and stock raiser. I 
live seven miles from Vernon. I saw the hides Exhibits A. and B.
has my brand on it in two places, on the ribw and on the hip. I 
have no other brand that s some cattle have it on once and some
of them twice. I have not disposed of any cattle for about two 
months I then sold four hundred head to Graves of Douglas Lake.
Theynwere delivered to him and taken away. they were not 
they were drivinm out at once. I did not sell any cattle to 
McKinnon. I have not been out amongst the cattle lately and cannot
tell if any are missing. I saw Emerson on Saturday mornng. He 
asked me if I ahd missed any cattle. I told him I did not know. He
took me to see a Hide in the brush below the Victoria Hotal and
tthe crack about half way down. The Hide I saw had my brand upon 
it. I first saw hide marked Exhibit b this morning in posessio
of the Govt. Agent. The Hides exhibits "A" and "B" are mine. The
reason that I have not missed any cattle is that I have not been to
round them up. I have not rounded any cattle up within the last six
months. Last Fall when Imrounded up I missed cattle and calves. 
When I rounded up before that I missed cattle. I dont know how 
many.</p>

<p>I cannot say whether the cattle I missed were stolen or 
not. The calves ought to be there. I knew the calves were there
when I branded them. I cannot account for their disappearance.</p>

<p>It would be a strange thing if the calves died. There
was no desease amonth them. From my knowledge on the range I cannot
say whether any were <del/> stolen or not. I cannot account for
their disappearance in any other way that their being stoloen; Why
I cannot swear that they were stolen is because I did not see any
one steal them.</p>

<pb/>

<p>xd. I think that I can safely swear that the
Exhibits "A" and "B" are not Graves hides, because Graves would
not allow the brand to be vented or the cattle rebranded as he
intended to market them at Victoria this summer. I do not know
whther he marketed them or not. Im delivered the cattle to Graves
at my corral I could not swear that he took them to Douglas Lake.
The last I saw of them they were about one mile from my Corral and 
going very well. I do not know whether Graves lost any I do not 
know if he sold any of them in this part of the country. I kill
what I require for my own use during the year. I have the hides
up at my own place. They are not kept under lock and key. I do not
know whether it is the custom to keep hide houses locked up. I hav
known the calf crop to come to my expectations. I do not knowthat
cayotes and wolves are hard on the calf crop in this country. I
do not know <del/> that I have lost cattle by poison during the
last two months. I lost some early in the Spring from that cause.
Sometimes a few of my cattle range as far as the mission. I lost 
eight or ten head in the spring from poison by wild parsnips.
A plant that killed some might have killed more if they would eat
it. I can only sweat to the two hides I have identified as bearing
my brand. Exhibit A I first saw in the brush below the Victoria
Hotel Exhibit B I first saw in the Government yard here -- I traced
one of the hides to McKinnon by Emerson from what he told me the
other, Exhibit B, by what Parke and Emerson told me.</p>

<p>Re. Exd. Several cattle are stolen from me each
year calves particularly. I suspected some one of stealing them.
I suspect some people more than others. The poisoner is among
those I suspect. The cattle only eat the wild parsnips just after
the snow goes off. In former years my cattle tan over the same 
range as they do now. I have noticed a marked decrease of the number

<pb/>

that should have come in during the past two years.</p>

<p>By McCayley, the number of people of people I suspect
is not large.</p>

<ab>C. O'Keefe.</ab>

<p>Henry Murk sworn, saith: I live in Vernon I am a Barber
I know Charles Emerson. I have heard that he gave evidence in this
case. He has lived at my place of an on for about three weeks. 
I do not know how he came there. I used to think jhe was one of the
unfortunates and could not get work, I never offered him work. My
brother offered him work in, my presence. He said he did not want
it. Emerson spoke to me two weeks ago last Monday night about making
$500. out of Jack McKinnon. I fix the date by a lecture I
attended with Emerson. I took a walk with him Monday before McKinnon
was arrested when we came to Jirouard's bridge we met a
half breed on horseback. The Indian made a sign and Emerson went
and spoke to him for a short time. I asked him what he was after.
We went to the coral. Emerson wanted to get his horse. He did not
get it. He went into the corral he did not meet any one there that
I am aware of. Last Monday week Emerson slept at my place. One
night, either Tuesday or Wednesday he did not sleep at my place. 
He did not sleep there on Thursday night. I told him to get other
quarters.</p>

<p>xd. I have known Emerson for three we weeks or a 
month.</p>

<ab>Henry Murk.</ab>

<p>William Nero n sworn saith: I am constable and night watchman in
Vernon, I met Emerson last Friday night about 11 o'clock P. M. he 
told me that he thought he had caught McKinnon. I asked him how
that was. He told me that he had found a hide under McKinnons'
stable; he said he had taken it over into the brush to inspect the

<pb/>

brand. He wished me to go with him to, see it. I told him I thought
it was a case for the Provincial Authorities to look after. I did
not wish to get mixed up with it. I saw him again about 5 o'clock
on Saturday morning. he was then going to where he had the hide. I 
have known Emerson by sight for over a year.</p>

These papers will be marked Number 1, 2, 3 - - down to 12 and 
they will be offered in evidence of John McKinnon. These are the 
originals from the Stpindary Magistrates Court of the Province of 
British Columbia, District of Yale.</p>

<p>The defendant objects to the introduction of either of
the papers marked respectively i, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 
and 12 on the ground that neither of the said papers testifyied
to by the <del>warrants</del> witness are properly authenticated so as to be admitable
as evidence in any court in the Province of British Columbia and
on the furthe ground that neither of said papers are admissable
as evidence in any court of the United States and <del/></p>

<p>Question. Are these the original papers and records of tha
court in the trial of McKinnon for the charge of larceny.?</p>

<p>Answer. Yes Sir.</p>

<p>Question. Do you know whether or not that those papers, those

<pb/>

those originals, are admisable as evidence in the Courts of
ritish Columbia.</p>

<p>Answer. Certainly.</p>

<p>Question. Are they admissable?</p>

<p>Answer. Yes Sir.</p>

<p>The defendants <del/> renew the objections above
set out as to the admission of each aof the papers testified to 
and make the additional objection as appears upon the face of the
papers that the defendant, John McKinnon is charged with the
crime of cattle stealing and charged with a crime not
extraditable in the treaty between <del>with</del> this Country and <del/>
Great Britain.</p>

<p>The objections are overuled.</p>

<p>The defendant excepts to the filing of the court <del>that the papers are
extraditable</del> <add><unclear>admitted this and with permission</unclear></add> and the commissioner <del>of the office</del> to withdraw them
when the proper certified copies should have been taken.</p>

<p>Question. How do you know that those papers could be offered
as evidence in all criminal cases in British Columbia.</p>

<p>Answer. Because they are. The deposition taken in the
first instances are evidence. It is not necessary
to recall a witness. They do it, if near at hand 
but it is not necessary.</p>

<p>Question. Do you use a deposition as evidence when the defendant 
is away.</p>

<p>Answer. Sometimes, yes sir, But it is not necessary. </p>

<p>The defendant now moves that he be discharged from the
custody of the Marshal and this proceedings be dismissed against
him on the ground that the offence charged <add>in</add> said affidavit and the
<del/> <del>report of the</del> documental evidence shows <del>and</del> the crime of cattle
stealing and is not an offence or crime extraditable between the
United States and Great Britain and on the additional ground 
<del>that no authority hsa been shown <unclear/></del></p>

<pb/>

<p>That it does not appear that the person who made the 
affidavit is agent <del>or authority</del> or any agent 
or party authorized to make a complaint in extradition cases and in
that the defendant is now in custody of the Chief of Police of
Spokane awaiting the hearing of a writ of Habeas Corpus issued
out of the Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington and in
custody under the process of the court. The defendant offers 
evidence the petition ordered for a <del></del> return and
writ of Habeas Corpus filed and issued out of the Superior
Court of Spokane County, Washington, marked (Defendants Exhibit "A)
. C").</p>

<ab>Motion.</ab>

<p>The Motion is overuled and upon the ground of the
motion with reference to the writ of Habeas Corpus. The motion
is overuled upon that ground for the reason that the court is
informed by one of the Police Officers under the Chief of Police
refered to that said Chief of Police is now holding the said
prisoner at the instance of the Province of British Columbia and
is a fugative from Justice and that he makes no resistance to the
application for his discharge by a writ of "Habeas Corpus."</p>

<pb/>

<p>That the said John McKinnon is now restrained of his liberty
in the County Jail of Spokane County, Washington, illegally,
by the said United States Marshal and <del>is</del> his said imprisonment is
illegal in this: that the said affidavit and complaint herein,
Marked Exhibit E does not charge the said petitioner with having
committed within the jurisdiction if the Province of British
Columbia in the Dominion of Canada, ot within the jursidiction
of Great Britain any crime provided for or specified in the rtreaty
between the United States and the Province of British Columbia in
the Dominion of Canada, or of Great Britain, and in this that the
said Arthur H. Kenyon as said United States commissioner had no 
jurisdiction whatever to issue any warrant in this cause for
the arrest of the said petitioner and had no jurisdiction whatever
to hear or determine said cause, in that the crime alleged in the 
said affidavit, marked Exhibit E and the crime alleged in the
complaint made by the said Cornelis O'Keefe marked Exhibit A and
upon which the said petitioner was examined before the said Magistrate
in the said District of Yale, is not one of the crimes mentioned 
in the treaty now existing between the United States and
Great Britain for the extradition of fugitives from justice and
is not an extraditble offence; and in that neither the said complaint
of the said Cornelius O'Keefe, marked Exhibit A. nor the 
said affidavit of the said E. C. Simmons, marked Exhibit E states 
facts sufficient to constitute a crime against the laws in the 
Province of British Colubmia in the Domion of Canada or of the
laws of the States of Washington or of the United States, and
neither of the said complaints state facts sufficient to give the
said commissioners Court jurisdiction to issue a warrant therein
or to try and hear said cause, in that that it does not appear upon
the face of the said affidavit of the said E. C. Simmons, Marked,
Exhibit E that the said E. C. Simmons, who made and signed the 
said affidavit was or is an agent or representative of the Province
of British Columbia in the Dominion of Canada or of Great 
Britain: and in that it does not appear from the said complaint,
Marked Exhibit A. that the said Arthur H. Kenyon has been author-
ized by any court of the United States to issue a warrant under
the provisions of title 66 <del>in the</del> Revised Statues of the United
States, 1878 or that the said Arthur H. Kenyon had any authority
to act in such proceedings and the said petitioner alleges that the 
said Arthur H. Kenyon acted without any authority of jurisdiction
in said matter and that all the proceedings before him were and
are void: that the said petitioner is restrained and has been 
deprived of his liberty without due process of law and in violaiton 
of the Constiturtion of the United States and <add></add> Great Britain
for the extradition of fugitives from justice.</p>

<p>Wherefore your said petitioner prays that a writ of
Habeas Corpus may be granted to him directed to the United States
Marshal for the District of Washington, demanding him, the said
Marshal to have and produce the body of the said petitioner before 
this Honorable Court at a time and place in said writ specified,,
