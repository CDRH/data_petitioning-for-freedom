<p>40 Sup. Ct. 566</p>
<p>64 Law</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Clark says: (page 1014 Law)</p>

<p>"The Acts of Congress give great power to the Secretary of Labor over Chinese immigrants and persons of Chinese descent. It is a power to be administered, not arbitrarily and secretly, but fairly and openly, under the restraints of the traditions and principles of free government applicable where the fundamental rights of men are involved, regardless of their origin or race. It is the province of the Courts, in proceedings for review, within the limits amply defined in the cases cited, to prevent abuse of this extraordinary power, and this possible only when a full record is preserved of the essentials on which the executive officers proceed to judgment. For failure to preserve such a record for the information, not less of the Commissioner of Immigration and the Secretary of Labor than for the Courts, the judgment in this case must be reversed."</p>
