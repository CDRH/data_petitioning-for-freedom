Q Is that such an opinion as would require evidence to remove or
change?
A Some. Yes sir.
Q Would it require strong evidence to change your opinion?
A Fairly good.

least one witness to change?
A Yes sir.
Q Is that opinion that you have now, a fixed and decided opinion
from what you have reas?
A no.
Q Assuming what you have read to be true have you, then a fixed
and decided opinion?
A Yes sir. If it was true,
Q Welll, at any rate you now entertain an opinion that would re-
quire strong evidence to remove?
A Well, it would require some evidence, yes sir. Not particularly
strong evidence; it would require some evidence.
Q It would require some evidence of at least one witness?
A Yes sir.
Q To change your present opinion?
A Yes sir.
