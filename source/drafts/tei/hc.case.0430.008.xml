<body>  

<p>In the District Court for the Third Judicial
District holding terms at Seattle W.T.</p>

<p>The Territory of Washington }No.5930
vs.
Henry Carlton</p>

<p>The Defendant comes before me, upon
Habeas Corpus</p>

To the writ the Sheriff /// that Defendant
is held by virtue of a commitment of which
a copy is attached to the retur, whereby it
appears the Deff. was convicted by and before
N. Soderberg a Justice of the Peace "of the crime
of Vagrancy by wilfully and unlawfully
/// the business of gambling as a
common ///"

<p>Whereupon the Justice adjudged "that
Defendant pay the costs taxed at Forty Dollars
and be committed for thirteen days or until the
sum be paid and should give a bond or
recognizance in the sum of two hundred and
fifty dollars for his good behavior for three months
from April 14, 1888 the date of the judgement herein"
"And whereas said Henry Carlton has failed
to pay said costs and to give the bond, therefor
the Keeper of the Jail is commanded to receive
and keep the Defendant until he shall be thence
discharged by due course of law"--</p>

<p>This commitment is dated April 24, 1888</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>The statute provides (Code Sec 1271) that gamesters
are "vagrants" and (Sec 1272) that on complains
made on aoth to a Justice of the Peace he
shall issue a warrant for the arrest and
examination of the person charged.</p>

<p>If it is made to appear to the Justice that
the charge is true, he may "require a bond for
his good behavior for those months thereafter"
(Sec 1275)</p>

The Justice is further required (Sec 1276) to
make a record and file it with the clerk of
the District Court specifying the nature and
circumstances of the charge and if the bond be
not fiven to commit the Defendant to jail
until such security be formed/// or such vagrant
be discharged according to law. *

A "gamester" is a "gambler" + being declared
by our statute to be a vagrance as such
required to give security for his good behavior"
it is intended thereby that the bond given
shall be a security that  he will cause the ///
practice of gambling - (sec. 1277)

<p>The Defendant may have a trial by jury
on the District Court on his own request-, and
without such trial the District Court may revise
such judgement of the Justice.</p>

<p>Sec. 1271 further provides that "the complaint
warrant and arrest shall be governed <del>by the</del></p>

<pb></pb>

by the jurisdiction of Chapter 134" so far as
it may be applicable, but by relevance thereto
the afore stated /// are not essentially
modified. Chapter 133 Sec. 1910 /// by provides
that "in all cases" where a person is required
to give security for his good behavior, the
magistrate must order that such prison pay
the costs and he "shall" stand committed
until such costs are paid or he be otherwise
legally discharged"

I may be contended perhaps that this section
applies only to the matter mentioned in
this chapter and has no relation to vagrancy,
not included therein, and some reasons may
be /// in support of such a contention --

<p>I think whatever argument might be made
however may be met by the provisions of section
2105 providing that a Justice may adjudge
costs against any persons convicted before him
or held to bail to keep the peace to be collected
as in cases of fines, and in all such cases
the Justice has power to commit a defendant
to Jail until the judgement for fine and
costs is satisfied (Sec. 1896)</p>

<p>I think it clear under laws that the
Justice of the Peace in this case, did not meet
his authority under the statute and that the
commitment is lawful on its face --</p>

My other reason is offered for the defendants
discharge. I have not here considered ///
criticism of language as no person should be
discharged from an order of commitment
on any more defect in the forms or words ///
(sec. 678) but in such cases the court if the defect
is material should hear the witnesses and
investigate the matter /// - and is required
to do so in all cases where such delect
appears. This as I understand is however
does not apply to a case where the commitment
shows or its face that the magistrate
had no jurisdiction in the matter.

<p>In this case it is ordered and adjudged,
that the Defendant Henry Carlton be remanded
and this writ of Habeas Corpus be and is
hereby discharged.</p>

<p>Dated April 28 1888</p>

<p>R.A. Jones
Judge</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>No. 5930</p>

<p>In the matter of the
application of
Henry Carlton
for a Writ of
Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Order of Court</p>

<p>FILED
APR 28 1888
W.E. Ledgerwood,
Clerk.</p>
