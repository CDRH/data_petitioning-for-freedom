    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Edward Rosewater, the petitioner, was charged with bribery to influence the republican legislative ticket of Douglas County, Nebraska, to secure votes by representatives elected if he secures the US senate seat. Rosewater then filed for a writ of Habeas Corpus because the State did not allow him to waive examination and refused to fix an amount for bond. He then walked out of the courtroom to waive the inspection, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Furthermore, Rosewater stated that the police judge and the State's attorney are both of the same political party and, on this basis, sought to annoy, harass, and disgrace him before the next election. Finally, Rosewater stated that he is innocent and can prove it. Judge Benjamin Baker hears the writer and allows it, and Rosewater is released. </li>
