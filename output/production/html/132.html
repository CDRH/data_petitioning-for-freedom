    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 6th, 1920, Clara Heaston submitted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of her minor daughter, Nellie Heaston. Ralph Heaston, Nellie's father, and John Clopper were named as respondents. In October 1919, Clara and Ralph divorced and Clara was awarded custody of their two children. Clara allowed the children to visit Ralph's sister in March 1920 on the condition that she would pick them up the next morning. Clara claimed that during the night, Ralph took Clara out of Colorado and to Nebraska and had since refused to return her. Ralph eventually placed Nellie in the custody of John Clopper. Originally, the case was to be continued to September 13th with Nellie remaining in the custody of Clopper during that time. On August 20th, a stipulation was filed dismissing the writ with prejudice and the record waived. It is unknown whether or not Nellie was returned to her mother.</li>
