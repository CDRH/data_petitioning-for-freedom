Washington Territory holding terms at Seattle.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In the matter of the application of

for a writ of habeas corpus }
No 4437
Judgment.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This cause coming on to be heard upon the return of the 
writ of habeas corpus herein before granted herein by which 
said return it appears that the said Lee Kee is held in 
custody by James Woolery, chief of Police of the city of Seattle 
and keeper of the city jail of said city in the jail of said city 
by virtue of a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">committment[?]</span> issued by G G Lyons, Esq Justice of the 
Peace for King County WT (Seattle Precinct) (the body of 
defendant being here produced together with the authority of said 
James H Woolery for his said detention.) and the court 
having heard argument thereupon and being fully advised
in the premises finds that the said <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">committment[?]</span> states 
as cause for petitioner's detention that  which is no cause 
and finds that the said Lee Kee is unlawfully restrained
of his liberty by the said James H Woolery.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is therefor ordered that the said Lee Kee be forthwith 
discharged from custody, and that he do recover of &amp; from 
the said James H Woolery, his costs and disbursements
in this action</p>
