    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Euphemia Eastwick petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve her son, Benjamin Eastwick, from the Oregon State Hospital in Salem, which was granted. Benjamin was adjudicated to be an insane person in 1911 and committed to the Mountain View Sanitarium in Portland. In 1912, Euphemia unsuccessfully petitioned for habeas to retrieve Benjamin from Mountain View, but succeeded in having him transferred to the state hospital. At the hearing, Euphemia claimed that she was able to care for her son "without the assistance of the State," citing wealth that Benjamin had inherited from family in Philadelphia. However, multiple physician witnesses, as well as Benjamin's state-assigned guardian, Harrison Platt, asserted that Benjamin suffered from incurable "dementia praecox," or what we now call schizophrenia, and was "unfit to be at large, except with a constant male attendant." After hearing the evidence, the writ was denied and Benjamin remanded back into the custody of the state hospital superintendent.</li>
