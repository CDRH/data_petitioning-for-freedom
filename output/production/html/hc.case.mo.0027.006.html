      <p class="tei_p">In obedience to the within writ, now appears <del>Anne</del> 
Mary Anne Scheiber and brings into Court the body of the 
child Edward Scheiber, and while she denies that she 
unlawfully detains said child, says that she is the 
mother of said child, who is still an infant, and that 
the petitioner, Joseph Scheiber is an improper person 
to have the custody of said child and has publicly 
proclaimed that the same is not his child. And therefore claims to be the legal &amp; proper custodian of the same.
