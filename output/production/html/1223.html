    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On January 11th, 1919, Nellie Atkins was removed from her Omaha home by three men claiming to be detectives. She was arrested and taken to jail without being served any warrants. On the following day she was, against her will, subject to a physical examination. She was then moved to the Detention Home on St. Mary's Avenue. She submitted a petition for habeas corpus on January 16th, claiming that she was being unlawfully detained because she had never been charged with a crime, no complaint was ever filed against her, she was deprived of the privilege of furnishing a bond, and had been held in the Detention home against her will. She named Marshall Eberstein and Ernest E. Manning as respondents in her petition. Her petition was granted. In his return to the petition, Manning expressed that he was acting within his rights as health commissioner. He determined that Nellie had a venereal disease and then requested she be isolated and quarantined so as to not spread disease. He did this based on Ordinance No. 9852. The order remanding her to the Detention Home is dated January 12th. It is unclear under what authority she was arrested. On January 18th, the writ was denied at costs of county. The fate of Nellie Atkins is unknown.</li>
