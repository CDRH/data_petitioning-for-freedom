    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 26, 1878, John Morrissey, Joseph Bartlett, and C.C. Thomas were charged with committing grand larceny in Uwatilla county, Oregon, by S.L. Morse in Walla Walla, Washington. Justice of the peace O.P. Lacy found probable cause to detain them and set their bail at $5000. As none of the men could pay the sum, they were put into the custody of Walla Walla county sheriff George F. Thomas on August 29 until their next hearing on September 26. The same day, John Morrissey petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that he was being detained illegally. Judge Samuel C. Wingard allowed his writ on August 28, and Sheriff Thomas filed his return to the writ on August 31, citing the writ of committment signed by Justice Lacy, but no more is known of Morrissey's fate.</li>
