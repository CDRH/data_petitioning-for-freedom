    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On behalf of her next friend, Richard Seward, Kittie Noonan petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve a boy named Bernard Seward from the custody of the Donohue and Danaher families, which was granted. While the hearing was pending, Bernard was placed in the custody of Fannie Noonan. After hearing the evidence, it was determined that the petitioners retained "effectual custody" of Bernard and&#x2014;since Bernard was not being detained by the respondents&#x2014;the cause was dismissed without prejudice.</li>
