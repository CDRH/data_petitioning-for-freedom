      <p class="tei_p">In answer to the writ of Habeas Corpus served upon me on the 25th day of June 1889 commanding me that I have the body of Wa Kim, by me imprisoned and detained as it is said, together with the time and cause of such imprisonment and detention before the Hon. C. H. Hanford, Judge of the aforesaid Court, at the Court House in the City of Seattle W.T. on June 27th 1889 at the hour of 10 o'clock A.M. I would say that on the 13th day of June 1889 a writ of Deportation was issued against the said Wa Kim <del>et al</del> by the said Court and placed in my hands for execution a copy of the said writ is hereto attached and marked "Exhibit A" and made a part of this return or answer. I thereupon endeavored to execute the said writ as will more fully appear by reference to the return upon said writ a copy of which is herto attached and marked "exhibit B." and made a part of this answer.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Court thereupon refused to discharge the said prisoner Wa Kim <del>et al</del> but left

him and the other prisoners in the custody of the United States Marshal stating that the writs must be executed, <del>and that he, the Hon. C. H.
