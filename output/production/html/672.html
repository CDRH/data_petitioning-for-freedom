    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On October 7, 1904, Tom Sing filed a habeas corpus petition against Thomas M. Fisher (the Chinese Inspector at Port Townsend) on behalf of his twelve-year-old son Ham Hung Wah. Sing and his wife Na Lay were described as being "alien" Chinese residents of Montana, while the twelve-year-old Wah was described as a native-born citizen born in Montana in 1893. The petition alleged that Wah had been arrested and detained by Fisher for being an "alien Chinese person" after returning from a visit to China. The petition stated that attempts to deport Wah were illegitimate because Wah was a citizen entitled to the same rights as other American citizens, which meant that he was entitled to judicial due process instead of an arbitrary decision by executive officials. Sing also submitted a document signed by five white witnesses testifying to his trustworthiness, his Christianity, and his adoption of the "habits of western civilization." Judge Cornelius H. Hanford commanded that Fisher show cause for his detention of Wah on October 25, 1904. On that day, Judge Hanford dismissed the petition at the request of Wah's attorney for unknown reasons; external scholarship states that Wah's application for entry was rejected by the Montana Chinese inspector and Lay was later deported in 1908. </li>
