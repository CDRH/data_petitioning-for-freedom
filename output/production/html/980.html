    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Jennie Miller filed a petition for her five year old daughter, Mary Alice Powers, who has been held against her will by R. J. Miller and Mary Elizabeth Miller, a married couple living in Seattle. The child was held by the Millers because Jennie Powers had divorced from her husband John Powers on the 6th of April from the same court as this petition. The petition was granted on April 9th and a court time was set for a custody hearing on behalf of Mary Alice Powers. At the hearing, Mary Elizabeth Miller argued that she is the grandmother of Mary Alice Powers and the mother of Jennie Miller Powers and she should have custody of Mary Alice Powers because the petitioner abandoned her on November 3rd, 1884, leaving her daughter, the bound party, wholly in the care of the respondents and that she is unfit physically and mentally to support the child. Jennie Miller Powers argued that while the child had been in the care of the Millers, she had not abandoned the child and is not unfit to care for the infant, as the child was only in the care of the Millers while the divorce suit was pending as an agreement between herself and her husband. Jennie Miller Powers alleged that the respondents had been paid for their care of the child and that they were conspiring with John Powers to keep Mary Alice Powers from her mother out of ill will and malice towards the petitioner. She further alleged that they were unfit in their care for the child because they are &#x201C;immoral in their talk and extremely lewd&#x201D;. The court&#x2019;s decision stalled until May 1888, when Judge Jones ruled that the custody of Mary Alice Powers should be returned to her mother, the petitioner Jennie Miller Powers. </li>
