<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON 
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application 
of MAC FOCK 
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>
<p>No. 2500</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM BRIEF.</p>
<p>By statute the decision of the Immigration officals 
is conclusive. Section 25 of the Act of February 20, 1907 
(found on page 27 of pamphlet herewith).</p>
<p>The decision is conclusive citizenship is 
claimed by the person denied entry.</p>
<p>United States v. Tu Joy, 198. U.S. 253; 
49 L. Ed. 1040;</p>
<p>The federal courts have no jurisdiction to issue a 
Writ of Habeas Corpus unless it appears that there has been 
a radical abuse of discretion or that the Department has 
plainly erred in the matter of law.</p>
<p>DeBruller v. Gallo, 184 Fed. 556;</p>
<p>United States v. Tu Joy, 198 U.S. 253;
49 L. Ed. 1040;</p>
<p>Chin You v. United States, 208 U.S.8; 
52 L. Ed. 369.</p>
<p>The certificate relied upon by Petitioner is not 
evidence of citizenship.</p>
<p>Ah How v. United States, 193 U.S. 65; 48 L. Ed. 619.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Holmes in delivering the opinion of the
<pb></pb>
court in the last cited case used the following langauge:</p> 
<p>"Lew Guey offered similar evidence and a certificate 
of another United States commissioner of a 
hearing before him and an adjudication that 
Lew Guey had the right to remain in the United 
States by reason of being a citizen thereof. *** 
As to the certificate of the United States commissioner, 
offered by Lew Guey, it was merely a 
written statement by commissioner that a 
person of that name was brought before him on 
the usual charge, and was adjudged to have the
right to remain in the United States by reason 
of being a citizen. Apart from the possibility 
that the commissioner in the present hearing was 
not satisfied of the identity of the party, such 
a statement is not the certificate of residence 
required by the act of 1892, and is not evidence 
of a judgement". 

United States v. Lee Poy Dew, 119 Fed. 786; 
Ex parte Lung Wing Wun, 161 Fed. 211. </p>
<p>I did not know of the last cited case at the time of the 
oral argument. It is from this Distict and is exactly 
parallel, the decision going even farther than your 
Honor need go in this case. Judge Hanford holds that 
while a Commissioner has authority under Section 13 of the 
Act of 1888 (page 16 of pamphlet herewith) to decide whether 
or not a Chinaman is is lawfully entitled to be or remain in 
the United States, yet such Commissioner does not have 
authority in such proceeding to</p>
<p>"establish the status of the accused person as a 
citizen of the United States, entitled to all the 
rights, privileges, and immunities of a citizen, 
including the right, to be subsequently exercised, 
of returning to the United States after a voluntary 
departure, therefrom."</p>
<p>In short, our contention is that in refusing to 
accept the certificate as evidence of citizenship, the 
Department is only following a well established rule of law
and cannot therefore be said to be abusing the discretion 
conferred upon it by Congress.</p>
