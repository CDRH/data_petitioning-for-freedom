<p>Q. Whose photograph is that? She first gave me the name of Ah Sing;
her name is Yut Yow.</p>
<p>Q. When and where did you first see this woman? A I have known 
Yut Yow for several years; for the past year, probably longer, I 
have known her to be a prostitute. We arrested her about two weeks
ago on the second florr of a building on the southwest corner of 
Fourt and Flanders Streets, this city.</p>
<p>Q Under what circumstances did you see her at that time? A We were
investigating that place, knowing that there were Chinese prostitutes 
up there, about two or three weeks before the arrest was made; we were
up there three or four times, Officer Wise and myself.</p>
<p>Q State briefly what you saw on the occasion of these investigations
so far as your observation is limited to this woman. A In the
first place we had information from different sources that there
were Chinese prostitutes up there. We watched the place on several
different occasions, and saw Chinese going up there <del>unclear</del> 
in the rooms that the women were in. We went up and talked to the 
women the best we could. At different times we found different men 
in this woman's room. Finally, about 4:30 in the morning, November
4th, we went up there with the purpose of making her arrest, and we
found a Chinese in bed with her.</p>
<p>Q Did you have warrant for the arrest of that woman at that time?
A Yes, for vagrancy and indecent and immoral acts.</p>
<fw>YUT YOW (5)</fw>
<pb/>
<p>Q In your capacity, experience and observation as a police officer in
the Chinese quarter on North Fourt Street, Portland, what have
you found to be the reputation of the place out of which this woman
was arrested? A It has the reputation of being a bawdy-house,
where Chinese prostitutes ply their trade.</p>
<p>Q Are there families living in the same building with these women? 
A Yes, in the same building, but not in that particular section;
they are mostly on the third floor.</p>
<p>Q Is it your experience that Chinese prostitutes and Chinese
families dwell in the same building without any particular notice 
of each other? A Yes, in some instances.</p>
<p>Q Is this case one of the instances that you speak of? A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Are you satified that this woman is a common prostitute? A I am.</p>
<p>Q Do you base your belief upon information and observation? A Yes.</p>

she first gave me the name of Ah Sing.</p>
<p>Q When, where and under what circumstances did you first see this
woman? A I have known her about a year. The first time I saw
her was when I arrested her in bed with a Chinaman up on Second
Street, on the charge of conducting and opium joint, because they
were smoking opium and she claim it was her room.</p>
<p>Q Has she been known to you here as a common prostitute? A Yes
I have caught her with a number of other Chinamen since. Along
<fw>YUT YOW (6)</fw>
<pb/>
about the 20th day of October, this year, I found her in room 17 of 
a building on the southwest corner of Fourth and Flaunders streets,
this city.</p>
<p>Q Under what circumstances did you see her there? A Investigating 
the place, gaining evidence as to this place being a house of 
prostitution and as to this woman's practising prostitution.</p>

about 4:30 in the morning.</p>
<p>Q Upon what charge did you arrest her? A Vagrancy and committing 
indecent and immoral acts.</p>
<p>Q Under what circumstances did you find this woman on the morning you
arrested her? A There was a Chinaman in bed with her. </p>
<p>Q Did she offer any explanation as to the situation in which she was
found at the time of the arrest? A She did not.</p>
<p>Q How did you gain your knowledge as to this woman's being a common
prostitute? A By observation and finding men in her room on
different occasions.</p>
<p>Q What if you know, is the general reputation of the quarters in which
you found this woman at the time of arrest? A That particular 
part of the building has the reputation of being a bawdy-house.</p>

but not in that part of the building.</p>

<p>Q Do you find in your experience that the so-called respectable elements
of Chinese have any scruples against living in the same building with 
prostitutes? A They live in the same building, but they don't 
associate together.</p>

<pb/>
<p>Q Are you satisfied from your observation extending over a period of
