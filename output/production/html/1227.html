    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On June 14, 1916, based on the facts in the complaint, Acting City Prosecutor T. J. McGuire filed a vagrancy complaint, charging Leon Angus with carrying a concealed weapon. On July 22, 1916, Angus petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that Sheriff McShane and County Jailor Schroeder unlawfully imprisoned and restrained him of his liberty. In the petition, he stated that on June 2, 1916, the police arrested him for "suspicious character." On June 14, 1916, William Ramsey (acting in the place of McGuire) drew up a vagrancy complaint, charging Angus with being a "vagrant." Instead of Ramsey signing a complaint, he used the rubber stamp of McGuire to fill the blank space for the complaining witness and wrote McGuire's name where the complaining witness was required to sign. McGuire was not present or sworn by the Police Magistrate Foster as required by the law, so no complaining witness was present or swore to the complaint. Without a complaining witness, Angus was arraigned, where he pleaded not guilty. He was tried for vagrancy, found guilty, and sentenced to ninety days in county jail. In his petition, Angus claimed that there was a misrepresentation of the charges in the vagrancy complaint. The complaint stated that Angus was charged with "carrying a concealed weapon," and there was a drawn line under the words "form of the statutes." As a result, he was sent to county jail on a state mittimus instead of a city mittimus. The petition was received on July 28, 1916, and on the same day, the judge accepted the petition. On August 1, 1916, the judge filed a writ of habeas corpus and the next day, Sheriff McShane responded to the writ, claiming that the charge was not illegal for the following three reasons. First, he claimed that Angus was convicted of vagrancy and carrying a concealed weapon. Second, although Ramsey drew the charges, he did it with the consent of McGuire. Third, it was the judge, with the approval of Ramsey, who included carrying concealed weapons and the line under the word on the complaint. He concluded that Angus should have made a complaint during the trial and asked that the Courts uphold the charges. However, on August 4, 1916, the judge ruled that Angus was illegally detained and should be released from custody. </li>
