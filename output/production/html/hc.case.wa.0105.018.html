very deep or dangerous.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Second. A stab in the nape of the neck, glancing downwards 
along the spine; about four inches and a half in depth and made 
apparently with a knife or some sharp instrument.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Third. A stab on the left shoulder, entering the socket 
about two and a half inches, made with same instrument 
as stated above.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Fourth. A stab in the back part of left shoulder striking 
the shoulder blade bone &amp; glancing downwards, about four 
and a half inches in depth, same as above.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Fifth. A stab through the left arm, mid-way between

with same as above.</p>

issued a portion of the lobe of the left lung, as large as

the same.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Eleventh. Wound in the left hand, the first or small finger 
being almost severed, and the second finger very badly cut,
