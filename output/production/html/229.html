    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 23, 1919, a court case was brought by Mrs. Roy Davis to Polk County District Court in Des Moines, Iowa, alleging that her daughter, Margaret Grundy, had become "incorrigible" and was no longer obeying her. Interestingly, Grundy was already over the age of 18 at the time of the court case. She was originally committed by judge Lawrence De Graff to the Industrial School for Girls in Mitchellville, Iowa, but was transferred to the House of the Good Shepherd in Omaha, Nebraska. However, on September 3, 1919, Mrs. Davis filed a writ of habeus corpus to try to regain custody of her daughter, alleging that the original judgement was obtained through fraud and coercion, and that she was threatened and lied to in order to get her to bring the case. It was served to the Mother Superior of the House of the Good Shepherd, Mother Raphael. Judge William A. Redick allowed the writ of habeus corpus and ordered Grundy's release on September 3, 1919, with court costs paid by the county treasury on February 5, 1920. Interestingly, 1920 census records show that Grundy was still working as a seamstress at the House of the Good Shepherd after she was granted her freedom. Perhaps these were based on outdated records, or Grundy decided to work for pay at the convent after her time as a student there.</li>
