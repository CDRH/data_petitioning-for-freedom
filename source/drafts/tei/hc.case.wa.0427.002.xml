<p>No. 5267 PETITION</p>


<p>TO THE HON. RICHARD A. JONES, JUDGE OF THE ABOVE STYLED COURT: </p>

<p>Your petitioner Junius Rochester petitions the Court and says -
That in this petition he appears in behalf of and as the agent of
Thomas S. Brown, G. Geods, George Downing, Chas. Schubard, Carl Jong Matson
named in the processes as C.J. Young and Peter J. Wegner.</p>

<p>II
That the said persons above named <add>were</add> defendants in cases of the
United States against them before Hon. C.D. Emery, United States Commissioner
at Seattle in King County, with jurisdiction to hear and try certain
causes at law.</p>

<p>III
That the above named persons are and each of them is illegaly,
wrongfully and without any authority of law restrained of his liberty
by Thomas Jefferson Hamilton United States Marshal for Washington
Territory, at McNeils Island at the United States Penitentiary in the
County of Washington Territory.</p>

<p>IV
That the cause and pretense of the restraint of the liberty of
said persons and each of them is the alleged commission of acts which
are in no wise a violation of any law of the United States or of the
Territory of Washington, and which constitutes no crime, misdemeanor or
offense whatever.</p>

<p>V
That the illegality of the restraint herein complained of consists
in the wrongful, unlawful and unwarranted detention of each of said
persons named herein as detained by the said Hamilton upon an alleged
commitment issued by C.D. Emery as aforesaid, which charges no offense
against the laws of the United States or Territory of Washington, and</p>

<pb/>

<p>your petitioner further says, that the recitals in said commitments and
in each of them, upon which the said Hamilton holds the said persons
shows that there has been no crime or offense committed by said persons
or either of them, and that the acts with which they and each of them is
charged do no constitute any offense against the laws of the United
States or Washington Territory, or any crime, misdemeanor or offese
whatever: that the several commitments in the case of each of said
persons are identical except the names of several defedants
are different in each: a true and exact copy of one of said commitments,
to wit: commitment in the case of Thomas S. Brown upon which said
Thomas S. Brown is held as aforesaid, and which is the sole and only
authority of the said Hamilton for detaining the siad persons or any
of them, is hereto annexed as part hereof and made a part of this
petition [marked exhibit A] and petitioner further says that the only
offense charged against the said Thomas S. Brown or against any of
said persons herein named is unlawfully restrained of their liberty,
is that each "of said persons" on or about the 10th day of October
1887, in the Territory aforesaid, disobeyed the orders of the Master of
the American ship Ivanhoe".</p>

<p>Petitioner says that there is no other or further cause for 
such detention save as above stated:</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays your Honor to grant unto the said 
Thomas S. Brown, G. Geods, Gerorge Downing, Chas. Schubarb, Carl Jong Matson
named in the processes as C.J. Young and Peter J. Wegner a Writ of Habeas
Corpus commanding and ordering the said Thomas Jefferson Hamilton to
produce before your Honor at such time and place as your Honor deems 
wise and meet the bodies of the said Thomas S. Brown, G. Geods, George 
Downing, Chas. Schubarb, Carl Jong Matson named in the processes as
C.J Young and  Peter J. Wegner, and that your Honor will hear and determine
whether they are or either of them is illegally detained or restrained
of his liberty and that they and each of them be discharged and
permitted to go their way without further delay detention, </p>
