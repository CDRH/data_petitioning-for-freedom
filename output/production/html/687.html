    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Joseph Tebo, a Native American on the Winnebago Reservation, was taken to the court in Thurston County following his Habeas Corpus release in April by judge Estelle of Douglas County on charge of fornication with an unmarried woman, Martha Walker beginning March 15, 1909. On April 19, 1910, Tebo was said to have plead guilty to the charge and sentenced to 90 days in jail, with last 15 days alternating 5 on 5 off, bread and water only, along with a $50.00 fine, and costs of trial. Tebo was placed in the Douglas County jail under conditions that Thurston County did not have safe facilities. Tebo and attorney, Julius S. Cooley, presented petition against E. F. Brailey, sheriff of Douglas County, charging that he had no jurisdiction to hold Tebo in Douglas County. In addition, they asserted that Tebo was tried twice for the same crime, against the constitution, that the alleged crime was not a felony, that his sentence was inhumane according to statues of Nebraska, that the alleged crime was committed on the Reservation, that as a ward (Indian) to the federal government state courts have no jurisdiction over his case, and that according to unwritten tribal custom his sexual relationship and cohabitation with Martha Walker made her his wife. E. F. Brailey, and attorneys, motioned for the petition to be quashed. On June 15, 1910, judge Estelle denied the writ and Tebo remained in the custody of Douglas County.</li>
