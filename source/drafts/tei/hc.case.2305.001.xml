<p>#2305</p>

<p>In The District Court,
Of the Second Judicial District of Washington Territory,
holding terms at Olympia for the Counties of
Mason and Thurston</p>

<p>The People of the
Territory of Washington
at the motion of John
Doyle
Ex parte</p>

<p>By the Writ of
Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>The Petition of John
Doyle to the Honorable John
P Hoyt Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court and Judge
of the Second Judicial District
of Washington Territory most
respectfully showith</p>

<p>That the said John Doyle
is unlawfully restrained
of his liberty by being confined
in the jail of Thurston
County by one William
Billings the Keeper of said
jail at the City of Olympia</p>

<p>That the cause or pretense
for confining your petitioner
is as follows. On the 14th
day of June 1884 at the County
of Mason in Washington Territory
one E.F. McReavy appeared
before one N J Ross a Justice
of the Peace in said Mason
County and falsely accused
your petitioner with motioning
Section 788 of the Code of Washington
Territory by putting obstructions
upon the track of a railway
whereby the lives of persons
travelling on said railway
were endangered. That the
said socalled railway is
a wood tramway on which
only cars are used. That
two cars drawn by
strain is used on said
road. That said E F McReavy
and one John Lathans and
John McReavy claim to be
<unclear></unclear> of said wood tramway.</p>

<p>That said tramway is a
private road way and not a
public way, and is solely
used by said three persons
McReavy, Lathans, and McReavy,
and by no one else, for
the sale and only purpose
of hauling logs from a
point in the woods a
short distance to a point
on Hood's Canal in said
Mason County, for the
sale and exclusive benefit
of said three persons named
and for no on else.</p>

<p>That near the place
where said tramway
was his said Hood's Canal,
this petitioner owned and
owns in fee and is and
was lawfully possessed
of a house garden and
farm, fenced and in
continuation on and long
before said 14th day of
June 1884. That while
so peaceably possessed
of his said home, the
said E F McReavy
and divers other persons
with force and arms broke
and therein down the fences
of your petitioner and dug
and tore up his grounds
fields and gardens and
spoiled his grain and
erected built and constructed
said wood tramway along
on and across your petitioners
lands and grounds. That the
offense for which your
petitioner is restrained
of his liberty consists of
his having fend up his
fences and with having
tried to prevent the building
and running said wood
tramway across his
said farm garden and
grounds.</p>

<p>That the said N J Ross
Justice of the Peace aforesaid
had no jurisdiction to
commit your petitioner
under section 788 afore-
said. That the offense
charged against your petitioner
does not constitute a crime.</p>

<p>That this application is
based upon the commitment
now in the hands of said
William Billings, upon the
affidavits hereunto annexed
and upon the whole record
in the cause of the Territory
of Washington vs John Doyle
your petitioner before said
N J Ross Justice as aforesaid.</p>

<p>That a notice of this
application has been duly served
upon J.C. McFadden the
Prosecuting Atty of the Second
Judicial District. That bail in
his case was fixed at the excessive sum of
$3000</p>

<p>Wherefore your
petitioner prays that he may
be discharged from custody
upon his own personal recognizance
of bail, or that his bail
may be reduced to $100.</p>
