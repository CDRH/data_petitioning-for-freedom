    <li>Summary of Proceedings: January 7th, 1913 the Secretary of Commerce and Labor issued a warrant for Marie Miler. She was arrested by an officer of immigration on the 8th and was charged with "being an alien found in the United States in violation of the Act of Congress of February 20, 1907, as amended by the Act approved March 26, 1910, to-wit: That she is an was a member of one of the classes of aliens required to be deported under the laws of the United States, to-wit: (That the said alien was connected with a house of prostitution, and practiced prostitution and derived benefits therefrom after she entered the United States." However the petition states that Marie was not able to defend herself because they only notified her of her right to an attorney after the immigration office examined her, as well as her attorney did not show up to court. The immigration office said they contacted the attorney Roger Marchetti and that he said he would show up but did not. Marie's new attorney believes it is the immigration office's fault for not getting him there and also not conveying that he was being resistant to Marie Miler. Marie also believes that her former partner or husband (both are used) is trying to get rid of her and take her property with other men in town. Marie says their affidavits are fake testimony because they are all conspiring to get her property (these men are referred to as the Italians). Marie seeks to be discharged because she was not represented by counsel, she paid him and he did not appear. The Immigration office believes the "petitioner alone is responsible for the neglect of her attorney". The new attorney working with Marie is Elias A Wright for her habeas petition. The petition is granted and the writ follows but her writ is subsequently denied ("quashed") because there are laws saying only the immigration officer has to be "satisfied" with proceedings for them to be valid (among other laws stated in both defendant and petitioner's briefs).</li>
