    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On January 31, 1920, Mabel Brooks, with the assistance of her attorney, Daniel Horrigan, filed a writ of habeus corpus claiming that she was unlawfully detained by Alvin Patton, superintendent of the Douglas County hospital. She claimed that she was committed to the hospital without a complaint, hearing, or official finding from the Insanity Commision, but rather, an "arbitrary and unauthorized action of one of the members of the said Insanity Commission." William A. Redick oversaw a hearing on February 2, 1920, in which it was found that Mabel had been regularly committed, but ordered that she be discharged. A writ and return was filed to this effect on February 6, 1920. </li>
