    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In March 1916, the Lane County Juvenile Court ordered the commitment of Constance Cheshire to the State Industrial School for Girls in Salem without ever alerting her parents about the proceedings. In December 1919, with Cheshire nearing her eighteenth birthday, her mother, Sadie Millett, and grandfather, Harry Ryan, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on her behalf, which was granted. The school superintendent, Margaret Mann, claimed that she had released Cheshire on parole to one Mrs. Charles Cleveland, whose relationship to Cheshire is unclear. After hearing the evidence, Mann was ordered to retrieve Cheshire from Cleveland and return her to the custody of her mother.</li>
