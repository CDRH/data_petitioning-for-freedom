    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In September 1919, Joseph O'Hare filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus on the basis he was being unlawfully restrained of his liberty by Michael L. Clark, Sheriff of Douglas County, Nebraska. O'Hare was charged with assault with intent to commit rape and allowed to give bail in the sum of $2,500 in default of said bail he would be committed to jail. The petition alleged at the preliminary hearing, witnesses were examined, and the evidence showed there was not probable cause for holding O'Hare. The petition also stated that O'Hare was 17 years of age, and under state law cannot be charged with assault with intent to commit rape. At trial, the court ruled against O'Hare, and the petitioner's attorney motioned for a new trial on the grounds the judgment was not sustained by sufficient evidence and contrary to law.</li>
