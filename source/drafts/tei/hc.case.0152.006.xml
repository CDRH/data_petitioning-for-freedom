vs.
Ray Raymond
I J.J. Piper being duly 
sworn on my oath depose
and say that I am now
and for the past six years
have been a resident of the
precinct of Pepue in Spokane
County Washington Territory.
That I have had a casual
knowledge that there was such
a case as the above named
ever since the homicide out
of which it grew. That I 
am well acquainted with
the people residing on land
Peone precinct land have
personal acquaintance with
the greater share of them,
and have opportunity to hear
the opinoin and sentiments
of the people of said precinct 
expressed and in a
general way know the same.
That I have never hear
any expression of hostility to
a prejudice against said
defendant Ray Raymond by
the residents of said precinct.
That if there was prejudice
and ill will existing against
her there, I should most
certainly have heard the
same expressed.</p>
