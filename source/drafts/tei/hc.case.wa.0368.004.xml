<p>United States District Court</p>
<p>Western District of Washington</p>
<p>Northern Division</p>

<p>No. 6360</p>

<p>Return</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Matoba Watari for Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Matoba Watari vs Petitioner;</p>

<p>T.W.Lynch, Acting Commissioner of Immigration, Respondent:</p>

<p>TO THE HONORABLE JEREMIAH NETERER, Judge of the District Court, of the United States for the Western District of Washington.</p>

<p>NOW comes the respondent, T.W.Lynch, Acting United States Commissioner of Immigration for the District of Washington, with headquarters at the port of Seattle, Washington, and for answer to the writ of habeas corpus in the above entitled matter says that he here produces the said Matoba Watari, the person named in the petition for said writ, in obedience to the command and direction thereof; and for further answer and return to said writ avers that he is detaining in his custody the said Matoba Watari for deportation from the United States as an alien Japanese person not entitled to admission under the laws of the United States, under and by virtue of an order of the Secretary of Labor of the United States issued to him, the said respondent, said order being in the words and figures following, to wit:</p>

<p>"55106/50</p>
<p>Seattle</p>

<p>October 29, 1921.</p>

<p>In re WATARI MATOBA</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM:</p>

<p>The letter from the port sets forth the material facts. The record indicates that, whether this Japanese was a</p>

<p>1</p>

<pb/>

<p>'deserter' or not, he had not been granted leave by any of the vessel's officers beyond the time when it should leave a Japanese port bound to a Chinese port. However it is immaterial whether he were a 'deserter', when he arrived he was not on a vissaed crew list and was a stowaway. Of course the Department would have discretion to admit were he not properly excluded on other grounds. While an appeal has been allowed, he is not entitled to an appeal, having been excluded as one afflicted with a loathsome contagious disease. The passport he has has already performed the function for which it was issued. He had broken his contact of employment and was not a member of the crew when the vessel sailed on its return trip from Japan. While he might at that time have been entitled to secure another Japanese passport as a returning Immigrant under the "Gentlemen's agreement" he arrives without such a document.</p>

<p>"Bureau recommends the appeal be DISMISSED.</p>

<p>For the Commissioner General,</p>
<p>F.H.Larned</p>
<p>Special Assistant."</p>

<p>Oct. 1921.</p>

<p>So ordered:</p>
<p>THEODORE G. RISLEY</p>
<p>Acting Secretary.</p>

<p>FJP</p>

<p>Saling Nov. 5."</p>

<p>Confirmation of Telegram</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Labor</p>
<p>Bureau of Immigration</p>
<p>Washington</p>

<p>October 29 1921.</p>

<p>55106/50</p>

<p>Immigration Service</p>
<p>Seattle, Washington.</p>

<p>Dedicant Watari Matoba.</p>

<p>Larned</p>

<p>Attest: For the Commissioner General</p>
<p>(sgd) F.M.Larned</p>
<p>Special Assistant.</p>

<p>OWM/GR</p>

<p>(Dedicant being a code word, its translation is as follows: Secretary has affirmed excluding decision case of following named alien and directs deportation).</p>

<p>Respondent attaches hereto the original record, decision, and exhibits, both on the hearing before the board of special inquiry at Seattle, Washington, and the hearing on appeal to the Secretary</p>

<pb/>

<p>of Labor, which papers constitute a part of this return.</p>

<p>And now the respondent having fully answered, prays that the said writ may be discharged.</p>

<p>T W Lynch</p>

<p>Acting United States Commissioner of Immigration.</p>

<p>THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>
<p>WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON</p>
<p>NORTHERN DIVISION</p>

<p>SS</p>

<p>T.W. Lynch, being first duly sworn, upon his oath deposes and says:</p>

<p>That he is acting commissioner of immigration, named in the foregoing return; that he has read the said return and knows the contents thereof, and that he believes the same to be true.</p>

<p>T W Lynch</p>

<p>SUBSCRIBED and sworn to before me this 10th day of November, 1921.</p>
