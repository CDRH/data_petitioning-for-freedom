<airtable:mention id=""menZImXcrAYDydFL5"">@Katrina Jagodinsky</airtable:mention>Â I would agree that Hammond is the holding party and that Mitchell and Russell are kidnappers in this case. But I don't believe it's because Hammond purchased Anson; I'm fairly sure he was the deputy sheriff acting as jailer. Hammond appears as the holding party in a few other of the Missouri cases. Plus, there's this incredibly problematic law enforcement webpage claiming he was killed in 1836 (https://www.odmp.org/officer/5990-deputy-sheriff-george-hammond). 

As for other freedom suits, I think we should distinguish between freedom suits, fugitive slave suits, and kidnapping suits. In kidnapping suits, the holding party is often going to be the kidnappers, although this suit shows that kidnappers occasionally deposited the people they seized with third parties. In freedom suits that don't involve kidnappers, the holding party is most likely going to be the enslaver. Is this helpful?

P.S. It occurs to me that we don't actually have the habeas petition for this case. We have the petition for a writ of trespass/assault/false imprisonment, and we have the writ of habeas corpus, but we don't have the petition for the writ of habeas corpus. Should we assume that William Clark supplied that petition, too?

<airtable:mention id=""menHEbipq3ZBSbExy"">@Cory Young</airtable:mention>Â this reading makes more sense to me; let's label Hammond as the holding party and jailer, while we label the Henrys as the kidnappers. I'm not ready to make a general rule, since I think many of these petitions will be idiosyncratic.
