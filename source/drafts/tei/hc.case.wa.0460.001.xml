<p>IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, FOR THE DISTRICT OF
WASHINGTON, <add>Northern</add> <del>Western</del> DIVISION.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of 
Moy Chong for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>272</p>

<p>Comes now the above named Moy Chong and for his petition and
complaint in writing for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, on oath res-
pectfully shows to this court.</p>

<p>That on or about the 10th day of March, A.D., 1892, he left
the city of Portland, Oregon, where he had resided for eleven
years immediately prior to said time, and had been for six years
last past engaged in the merchantile business, for Hong Kong, Chi-
na, and that he did, prior to taking hissaid departure, appear
before one J. E. Marks, a Notary Public andthen and there sub-
scribe<del>d</del> and make the certificate hereunto attached a copy marked as
exhibit "A" and making and forming a part of this petition.</p>

<p>2. That all the facts and circumstances as set forth in said
statement are true; that petitioner had, for six years last past
been actively engaged as a Chinese merchant in Portland, Oregon,
and was at said time doing business at 140 Second Street and was
a member of the firm of On Chong Wa &amp; Co., and as a member of said
firm still having and retaining all of his said interests in said
business, which was the sum of $2,000 and still having and re-
taining and receiving his share of the profits from said business
and was at said time a bone fide owner and holder of a one-seventh
interest in said business, the capital stock of said business be-
ing $14,000 and your petitioner being one of the partners in said 
business; and your petitioner fully and completely relied upon
said J. E. Marks as an attorney at law for the proper wording and
making of said certificate and fully believes that the same fully</p>

<pb/>

<p><unclear></unclear> completely complies with the law as in such cases made and
provided; that to said certificate is attached a photograph of
your petitioner, which photograph petitioner had taken for the
purpose of having same attached to said certificate; and petition-
er further states that at said time he did obtain the statement of
persons well and favorable known to him, one of said persons be-
ing J. D. Wisdom and one W. W. Taylor who are bote well and per-
sonally acquainted with the petitioner and who are now absent from
the city's of Portland; and that thereafter on the 4th day of May
1893, said W. W. Taylor did make oath that he was the identical
W. W. Taylor who made the foregoing statement and your petitioner
did on the same day obtain an affidavit from one Lee Chung his
partner in said business, which affidavits of said Taylore and
said Lee Chung were attached to said petition and were duly pre-
sente d to the collector of customs at Tacoma, Washington.</p>

<p>You petitioner further states that he did, on or about the
10th day of March, 1892, take his departure from Portland for
Hong Kong, China, and did there remain and visit relatives and 
friends and transact his business and the business of said firm,
which was that of viewing, examining and ascertaining the prices
of goods and making arrangements for the buying and shipping
from the manufacturer in China; that thereafter, he did, about
the 10th day of January, 1893, take passage on the steamship Vic-
toria at Hong Kong, China, to return to the United States of
America, and that he did pay his fare for said passage and did re-
turn to and was landed at the steamboat wharf at Tacoma, and did
then and there present his certificate andrequest to be landed;
that one Plummer, representing himself to be a deputy collector
did, without any cause, right or authority, and without explain-</p>

<pb/>

<p>-3-</p>

<p>ing or making known to this petitioner any of his reasons for not
allowing him to land, refuse to allow your petitioner to land, al-
though your petitioner had in all ways and manner complied with
the laws of the United States of America, and did offer and was
willing to produce the witnesses who signed said statement to
said certificate, together with other witnesses both white and
Chinese who knew and would identify <del>him</del> your petitioner as having 
resided in the city of Portland for a number of years last past,
and as being a good, honest, upright and bona fide merchant in
said city and a member of the firm doing business at 140 Second
street, in the city of Portland, Oregon, but regardless of said of-
fers, said Plummer made to your petitioner or to one Moy Yuck who
well understands and speaks the English language, no satisfactory
explanation whatsoever, and gave him no reason whatsoever for re-
fusing to admit your petitioner, but did take from your petitioner
his certificate with his photograph hereto attached, and the
statement as thereto attached signed by the petitioner and re-
spective parties as set forth in exhibit "A", and did refuse to re-
turn same to your petitioner and has ever since said tine retained
same and does still continue to retain same, and your petitioner
has not had or seen the same since said time, and the same is
still had and retained by said Plummer or the Collector of Customs
or some one under him, without the consent and against the wish and
protest of petitioner, and petitioner further states that on the
evening of the 8th day of May, 1893 about the hour opf 5 o'clock, 
he was informed that the said steamer Victoria, with a large num-
ber of Chinese passengers, about two hundred in number, nearly all
of whom were strangers to this petitioner, and of whom he knew 
nothing, and had no relation, would, at 4 o'clock on the morning
of the 9th inst. loose from the wharf at Tacoma, and be cleared</p>

<pb/>

<p>for and return upon her return trip to Hong Kong; and that your
petitioner, together with his two companions, who are likewise
merchants and who likewise ask for a writ of abeas corpus, would
be forcibly, unjustly, unlawfully and illegally, and without any
cause whatsoever, and without being informed as to any cause, com-
pelled to remain upon said vessel and thus be compelled to return
to Hong Kong. That your petitioner did cause to be made, diligent
search and inquiry to find and ascertain the whereabouts of this 
Honorable Court to apply to it for a writ of habeas corpus, and
did apply <add>in absence of the Court</add> to the Commissioner of your Honorable Court for said
writ, which was refused by said Commissioner for the reason that he
had no authority to issue said writ, and that your petitioner was
then compelled to resort to and did apply to the Superior Court 
of Pierce County, washington, for a writ of habeas corpus, setting
forth the facts and circumstances, which application was consider-
ed by the Court and by said Court, the Honorable W. H. Pritchard
<del>who</del> granted, said writ in the words following to-wit: "Let the
writ of habeas corpus and the warrant issue as prayed for in the
within complaint and petition. May 8, 1893. W. H. Pritchard,
Judge." That the said W. H. Pritchard was, at that time one of
the duly elected and qualified and acting jusges of the Superior
Court of the State of Washington, for the County of Pierce, said
cause being number 9689 as appears by the record and files of
said Superior Court of the State of Washington, for the county of 
Pierce; and that thereupon the clerk of said court did, under the 
seal of said court, issue said writ of habeas corpus and warrant fo
for the arrest of said <del>Wah Ni</del> Moy Chung as prayed for in said petition, and
under said writ the sheriff did proceed to the steamboat wharf
and to the steamer Victoria, and ask for the said <del>Wah Ni</del> Moy Chung, who was
called for by the captain of said steamer, and without any fur-
ther orders and without any protest, ordered the said Moy Chung to
go ashore, which said Moy Chung then and thereupon do, without
any protest or resistance or proceedings of any kind of any rep-</p>

<pb/>

<p>resentative whatsoever of the United States of America; and that
the said captain did thereafter appear before the said Superior
Court and make and file his written answer to said writ of habeas
corpus, and that then and thereupon, and upon the filing of said
answer, the said petitionre <del>Wah Ni</del> Moy Chong by his counsel demurred there
to, which demurrer was by the court sistained andafter hearing
the respective counsel and arguments of same, the said <del>Wah</del> Moy Chung was then
and thereupon by said court, in the presence of the oficers of the
government discharged by the said Superior Court which he was be-
fore, all of which proceedings, including the said petition, or-
der of said court, writ of habeas corpus, warrant of arrest and
return of the officers upon it andsaid process, answer of the said
captain, the ruling and order of the court and record of the pro-
ceedings of the respective parties, appears of record in the rec-
ords of the Superior Court of the State of Washington for the
County of Pierce in cause number 9689 as given, made and filed
therein.</p>

<p>That immediately upon the discharge of said Moy Chung as afore-
said he was then and thereupon arrested charged with being ille-
gally in the United States of America, and was taken before Honor-
able Miles E. Clifford, Court Commissioner of theCircuit Court
of the United States at Tacoma, who proceeded to inquire into said
cause, and did refuse to allow said petitioner to be <del>re</del>turned over
to the United States marshall to be returned to said steamer Vic-
toria, which was still at the wharf of Tacoma and ordered that
said petitioner be held and returned by the United States marshall
for a hearing before him, which hearing was fixed for the 17th day 
of May, 1893 at 10 o'clock in the forenoon, at which hearing evi-
dence was <del></del> introduced for the respective parties and your said
petitioner was by said Commissioner ordered discharged from which or-
der, judgment and ruling, with the consent of the <del>United States</del>
attorneys waiving all forms and regularities of giving notice, an</p>

<pb/>

<p>appeal was taken to this Honorable Court, and upon the question of
jurisdiction of the United States Commissioner being, by the
United States Attorney raised, this Honorable Court did, on the
5th day of June, 1893, order that your petitioner be turned over
to and placed in custody of the United States marshall, J. C.
Drake, who proceeded and took your said petitioner into possession
and now forcibly, knowingly, unlawfully andwithout just cause is 
now holding, detaining and retaining and keeping in confinement
your said petitioner, although he has demanded his liberty and your peti-
tioner states that he can, if allowed a hearing before this Hon-
orable Court, show that he has fully and completely complied with
all the laws of the United States and the rules andregulations
thereof, and regardless of said compliance, the collector of Cus-
toms did wilfully, knowingly, arbitrarily, unjustly and unlawfully,
and without any cause, right or authority, refuse to admit your 
said petitioner and allow him to land, and that your said peti-
tioner is rightfully and justly entitled to land and be and re-
main in the United States of America, and go his way to his former
residence as heretofore stated and resume his business at the city
of Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p>Your petitioner further states that he at this time is im-
prisoned at the United States penitentiary at McNeil's Island, in
Pierce County, Washington, and within<del>g</del> the jurisdiction of this
court; that he is not detained by virtue of any order or process
issued by the United States Court, nor by virtue ofany execution
or any other process, judgment, decree or final order of any state
court or any other court other then herein stated as aforesaid;
and that he is not held for the violation of any law, rule or
regulation or in punishment for any crime by him committed.</p>

<p>Petitioner further states that he is advised by Marshall K.
Snell, his counsel, who resides at Tacoma, Pierce County, Washing-
ton, and who is a counsellor of this court, having and holding a 
certificate authorizing him to practice in and before this court,
that such imprisonment is illegal for the reason and facts as
herein set forth, and that under and by virtue of the laws of the
United States, a writ of habeas corpus directed to the said United 
States marshal should be issued by this honorable court to bring 
before it your petitioner.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE, your petitioner ever prays and hereby applies for
a Writ of Habeas Corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the
cause of such imprisonment and restraint, and delivering him
therefrom and discharging him from custody.</p>
