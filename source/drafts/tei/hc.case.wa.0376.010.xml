<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON</p>
<p>NORTHERN DIVISION</p>

<p>No. 6617</p>

<p>MEMO OF AUTHORITIES
SUBMITTED BY
GOVERNMENT</p>

<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION
OF JUNICHI YAMAMOTO
FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS</p>

<p>It appears that petitioner on or about September
17, 1917, being at said time a member of the crew, a seaman,
on the steamship TAIYO MARU deserted said steamship at Seattle,
Washington, and ever since said date had been in the United
States. It appears from the record and from the petitioner's 
testimony that at no time was petitioner in possession of 
a passport from the Japanese Government. It further appears
that he never presented himself for admission into the United
States, and his subsequent residence here has been, without
dispute, clandestine and surrepitious.</p>

<p>Section 19 of the Immigration Act, (Act of Feb.
5, 1917), provides:</p>

<p>"That at any time within five years after
entry, any alien who at the time of entry
was a member of one or more of the classes
excluded by law; any alien who shall have
entered or who shall be found in the United
States in violation of this act, or in vio-
lation of any other law of the United States;
*****"</p>

<p>Within five years after petitioner's surrepitious
entry in the United States, he was arrested by the United
States immigration officials, under a warrant of arrest issued
by the Secretary of Labor, and was given a hearing before
immigrant inspector at Seattle, upon the charges in said warrant.
The record of said hearing was forwarded to Washington, and</p>

<p>1</p>

<pb/>

<p>upon such record the Secretary of Labor decided that petitioner
was in the United States in violation of the immigrantion laws
of the United States, to wit, in violation of fule 11 of the
immigration rules, in violation of the President's Proclamation
dated February 24, 1913, in violation of the "Gentlemen's
Agreement" between the United States and Japan, and was further
a member of an excluded class, to wit, that at the time of
his entry he was a person likely to become a public charge.</p>

<p>Upon such findings the Secretary of Labor thereafter
issued his warrant of deportation, which warrant is fully set
out in the return filed herein, and it is upon the basis of 
this warrant that the petitioner is detained by the Immigration
Commissioner and held for deportation to Japan.</p>

<p>Under the President's Proclamation referred to, and under
the"Gentlemen's Agreement", and under rule 11 of the immigration
laws, there is no dispute that the petitioner entered the
United States in violation of this provision of the law <del>and</del>
in that at the time of his entry he was a laborer, skilled or
unskilled, and had no passport issued by the Japanese Government.
He was therefore a member of an excluded class; and this proceeding
falls squarely under the portion of Section 19 of the Immigration
Act referred to.</p>

<p>The facts in the case of AKIRA ONO versus United States,
M 267 Fed. 359, (C.C.A.9th Circ.) are identical with the facts
in this case, and in the case the Circuit Court held that
the petitioner was subject to deportation as having deserted
his vessel and entered the United States clandestinely, without
a passport from the Japanese Government, he being at the time
of his entry a laborer, skilled or unskilled. Without quoting</p>

<p>Ms E-</p>

<p>Will you please present this
Order in the morning June, Marshal
wants to <unclear>get</unclear> mid of the <unclear>boat</unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear>
leaking, and the sale price wa<unclear></unclear>
good.</p>

<pb/>

<p>from this case, it is sufficient to say that it clearly covers
the case at bar and is conclusive of all contentions made by
the petitioner.</p>

<p>Your Honor's attention is further invited to
four recent cases decided by Your Honor, the facts in all of
which cases are absolutely identical with the facts in the
present case, and in all of which recent cases Your Honor,
following the Ono case supra, denied the writ. These cases
are as follows:</p>

<p>NISHIKAWA MAMORU, No. 6414 (check mark)</p>

<p>IWAMATUS MATSURO, No. 6415 (check mark)</p>

<p>EIJI FUKUNAGA, No. 6435 - p. 517</p>

<p>SHIZO MATSUKAWA, No. 6438. (check mark)</p>

<p>Respectfully submitted.</p>
