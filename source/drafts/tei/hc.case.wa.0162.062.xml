<p>Spokane Falls Chronicle...July 1, 1886</p>

<p>"A pistol shot was heard in the direction
of the Bay Window house Friday night about
midnight. Officer Gillepsie going to investigate 
found in the open hallway a man dying
with a bullet hole in his neck and bending
over him the proprietress, Ray Raymond.
Investigations develop the facts that the
man, James Finch by name, had gone into the
house under the influence of liquor, had been
ordered away, but refusing to go to the keeper
of the disreputable place, Ray Raymond, had 
shot him. The woman says that she endeavored 
in a peaceable may to induce him to leave,
and that only when the man struck at her did
she resort to the pistol. About 2 o'clock 
Saturday morning the man did. The
woman was taken into custody by the officer
Saturday morning the coroner's inquest was
held, and the verdict marked that deceased
had come to his death by a show from a pistol 
in the hands of Ray Raymond. The
matter was referred to Justice Peel, complaint 
entered before him by Prosecuting
Attorney Hyde, and a preliminary examination 
commenced Tuesday. It is not
yet concluded."</p>

<p>Spokane Falls Chronicle...July 8, 1886</p>

<p>"The preliminary examination of the 
woman Ray Raymond arrested for the
killing of James Finch resulted in a decision 
that she be held to await the action
of the grand jury on charge of murder in
the first degree. The decision fell with
crushing might on the accused. She was
taken to Sprague and brought back here
early this week on a writ of habeas corpus.
Considerable time has been spent by the
attorneys for the defense, in an endeavor
to show that confinement in jail would
be very detrimental to the health of the accused, 
would perhaps endanger her life.
Should this endeavor prove successful, bail
may be received. Under the laws of the territory
murder in the first degree is not bailable,
where the evidence of guilt is strong, except
in cases where it is shown that the above 
mentioned dangers are very probable. Yesterday 
nearly the entire medical force of the
city was called to testify as to the woman's
ability to bear the confinement of the
jail."</p>

<pb/>

<p>Spokane Falls Chronicle...July 15, 1886</p>

<p>"judge Turner decided last Saturday
that Ray Raymond should be held only
on charge of murder in the second degree,
and that a $5,000 bond would be received.
The judge also ruled that bail would necessarily 
have to be granted through defendant 
were held on charge of murder in
the first degree, in as much as her health
would not allow the confinment of
the jail. Bond has not yet been given,
but will probably be soon. The woman
is now in jail at Cheney."</p>
