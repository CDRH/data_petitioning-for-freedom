<p>Territory of Washington
vs.
Ray Raymond
Territory of Washington
County of Spokane}ss
I, H. Whitehouse being
first duly sworn doth depose and
say I am a resident of Spokane 
Falls in said county and Territory that
I am a practicing physician and 
surgeon, that I have lived in said 
Spokane Falls for several years
that I am well acquainted with the
people in and around said place
and heard numerous expressions
from many persons relative to
the case of Ray Raymond and
her action in relation to the death
of Finch. That he heard from
many of such people strong
expressions of hostility against
said Ray Raymond <del>strong</del> strong
indeed as to call her a cold
blooded murderer and say that she ought to
be hung. So wide spread was
this feeling so the time of the
death of Finch that an almost
covered corner of the street in said
city the matter was the common
subject of conversation and in
such conversation the universal
expression was that of hostility
to said Ray Raymond
and applicant says from the
expressions he heard as aforesaid
and his knowledge of the feelings
of the people generally of
Spokane County he does
not believe that said
defendant Ray Raymond
can have a fair and
impartial trial in said
county.
T.H. Whitehouse
Subscribed &amp; sworn to before
me this December 4, 1886.
