<p>In the District Court
Of the Second Judicial District of Washington Territory
holding terms at Olympia for the Counties of
Thurston and Mason</p>

<p>C.H. Phillips
Ex Parte
Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Petition</p>

<p>To the Honorable John
P. Hoyt Judge of the Second Judicial
District and Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court of Washington
Territory</p>

<p>The Petition of Charles
H. Phillips respectfully shows
to your Honor that he is now
a prisoner, confined in the custody
of William Billings Sheriff of the
county of Thurston, in the county
jail in the city of Olympia
in said county, for a supposed
criminal offense, to wit: The
crime of Grand Larceny.</p>

<p>Your petitioner also shows
that such confinement is by
virtue of a pretended warrant
issued, by one W.T. Keady a
Justice of the Peace. That
your petitioner is not im-
prisoned or detained by virtue
of any process issued by
any court officer or tribunal
upon any final judgment
order or decree, nor for
any contempt of any court,
body, officer or tribunal, nor
upon any indictment of
any Grand Jury.</p>

<p>And your petitioner further
states that he is advised by
counsel, D.P. Ballard residing
at Olympia, and so believes
that his said imprisonment
is illegal, and that said
illegality consists in this,
to wit: That no depositions
of witnesses were taken and
reduced to writing and signed
by the witnesses as required
by Sec 1933 Code of Washington.</p>

<p>No complaint was reduced
to writing by the magistrate
and no witnesses examined
as required by law.</p>

<p>No case of probable
cause existed or exists
for charging your petitioner
with said crime. And
your petitioner is innocent.</p>

<p>No sufficient com-
plaint was filed with the
magistrate. No judgment
has been <unclear></unclear> by the
magistrate as required by
law. No legal warrant
was issued and no valid
commitment granted.</p>

<p>No offense has been
charged against defendant
as required by law.</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner
prays a writ of Habeas Corpus
to the end that he may be
discharged from custody.</p>

<p>Charles H Phillips

named in teh above entitled action: that he

thereof, and believes the same to be true</p>
