VOTERS, BEWARE!!

Mr. J. P. McGlinn, the Republican nominee for Joint Councilman against the People's candidate, James Hamilton Lewis, not being satisfied to betray the Prohibition party after they had made him their candidate, by taking several Seattle gentlemen in the Blue Front saloon on Mill sgtreet and there with them indulging in intoxicating liquors, now descends so very low, it is stated as to have at his personal expense tickets labeled People's Party tickets, placing his own name as Joint Councilman nominee of the people, and that in the face of their refusal to accept him as the incandidate, notwithstanding his many different appeals to them. If he thinks that he can defeat honest and able James Hamilton Lewis by such methods, the workingmen of our county will prove to him that he is mistaken and that they know that Lewis is their friend. The same act has been attempted by the Republicans as to W. W. New'in against J. T. Ronald. But, voters, beware! and stand by your ticket as it appears in the Press.
