    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Oscar J. Quinn was charged with "drunkenness and reckless driving" by Police Magistrate Charles E. Foster on August 5, 1920 after he allegedly became drunk in public before recklessly driving a car on the highway. Quinn plead guilty and was sentenced to 15 days in county jail on August 6, 1920. Quinn filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against Sheriff and Jailer Michael L. Clark, alleging in the petition that he was being wrongfully detained. His principal argument was that the mittimus issued to jail him stated that he was detained for violating Nebraska state statutes, when in reality he was found guilty of violating the ordinances of Omaha. He also alleged that the Police Magistrate had wrongfully substituted city ordinances for Nebraska state statutes on the complaint against him. Judge A. C. Troup commanded Michael L. Clark to show cause before the Court for Quinn's detention and also issued subpoenas to city clerks to bring the original complaint against Quinn and city ordinances 10192 and 10370 to the Court. The outcome is unknown. </li>
