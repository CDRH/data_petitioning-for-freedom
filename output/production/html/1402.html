    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On July 23, 1923, Anna and Vince Wardyn entered an agreement with Margie and Fred O. Mueller concerning their two-year-old daughter Margie Wardyn. The Muellers were the girl's aunt and uncle. According to the petition filed on August 24, 1923, the Wardyns believed they were signing documents agreeing to compensate and temporarily allow the Muellers to take care of Margie. However, they were actually signing adoption papers. Anna Wardyn specified that she was born in Poland and is not familiar with the English language. Vince said that he was intoxicated while signing the papers and didn't even remember the event. The adoption proceedings took place on July 24 and Judge Bryce Crawford entered the adoption decree on August 8. The respondents replied to the writ and argued that they received the consent of the Wardyns to adopt Margie. They also argued that Anna attended night school for several years and knew how to read, write, and speak in English. The Muellers filed a motion to dismiss the writ. On August 29, 1923, the hearing for the writ was denied. Judge Day didn't believe that Anna and Vince hadn't understood the writ, and to give them their child back would be to "reward perjury." Sometimes, he said, the court had to consider the legal aspects of the case before a child's welfare.</li>
