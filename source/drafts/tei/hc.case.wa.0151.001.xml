<ab>IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE DISTRICT
OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</ab>

<ab>FERDINAND MARINO and
CAROLINA BELUSCIA MARINO,
his wife,
Petitions,
vs.
D. H. McCALLA,
Defendant.</ab>

<ab>PETITION.</ab>

<p>The petitioners for cause of action against the defendant,
allege:</p>

<ab>I.</ab>

<p>That they are, and for more than twenty years last
past have been continuously, husband and wife. That they are the 
parents of Joseph Marino who was born to them as issue of their
said marriage on to=wit: the 24th day of June, A. D. 1886; and at
all times since the birth of said Joseph Marino have been, and 
now are, entitled to the custody and control of the said Joseph
Marino.</p>

<ab>II.</ab>

<p>That the defendant D. H. McCalla is an officer of the 
United States Navy, holding the rank of Captain therein, as your 
petitioners are informed and believe. That the said defendant
by virtue of his rank and under the orderes of his superior officers,
is now in the actual and active command of the United States
battleship "Wisconsin", now lying off the United States Dry Dock
of Bremerton, Kitsap County, Washington, within the jurisdiction
of this court. That the said defendant D. H. McCalla as the captain
and commander of the said battleship Wisconsin, unlawfully
and by force detains in his custody on the said ship Wisconsin,</p>

<ab>1</ab>

<pb/>

<p>the said Joseph Marino, minor son of your petitioners; and the
said Joseph Marino is now unlawfully and by force held and detained
by the said defendant D. H. McCalla in his custody upon the said
ship Wisconsin. That your petitioners are informed and believe
that the said defendant D. H. McCalla claims the right and authority 
to detan the said Joseph Marino in his custody upon said
ship Wisconsin by virtue of a pretended enlistment alleged by
the said defendant D. H. McCalla to have been theretofore made
by the said Joseph Marino in the navy of the United States, which
pretended enlistment is claimed by the said defendant to have
been made on or about the 4th day of December, 1901. That if 
the said Joseph Marino at the said date, or at any other date,
attempted to enlist in the navy of the United States, said attempted
enlistment was wholly without authority or consent of your
petitioners, or either of them,; that your petitioners have not,
and neither of them has, either orally or in writing, ever consented 
that the said Joseph Marino should enlist in the navy of 
the United States. That the enlistment claimed by the defendant
to have been attempted to have been made by the said Joseph Marino
in the navy of the United States was made, if at all, wholly
against the will and without the authority or consent of your petitioners,
or either of them.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE your petitioners pray that this honorable 
court will, by its writ<del>e</del> of habeas corpus directed to the said 
Captain D. H. McCalla, require the said D. H. McCalla to make
return to the said write<del>e</del> as required by the statutes of the United
States and the practice of this court, at a time and place to be 
named in and said writ; and further require the said D. H. McCalla
at the time and place in said return, to produce before this
court the body of the said Joseph Marino.</p>
