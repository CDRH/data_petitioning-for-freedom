in said County for the examination of S.M McFarland
 the above named defendant upon the
written complaint under oath of M Cross charging

One brown mule about seven years old One brown mule
about seven years old One set of team harness and
one 3 1/2 inch Steel Skein Barn Wagon which said

therefore towit On May 15th 1886 duly mortgaged
by certain chattel mortgage bearing date on that
day to M Cross to secure the payment by a certain
promissory note therein set forth which said
personal property was at the date of said mortgage
situate in Columbia County aforesaid and that
said property was so removed as aforesaid
without the said mortgage being duly released
and without the consent in writing or otherwise
