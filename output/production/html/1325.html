    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Minnie and Norberg were married, living with their daughter, Corine. Minnie and Norberg stopped living together on May 28, 1900 and Norberg deserted Minnie and Corine with no support. Norberg threatened to abduct the child. Abducted the child on January 31, 1901. Minnie got Corine again and put her somewhere safe, visiting her daily. Minnie wanted a divorce and had another case pending for that. In that case she asked for custody of the child. In this case, Minnie is asking for a Writ of Habeas Corpus to get her child discharged from Norberg&#x2019;s custody. Case filed on March 7, 1901. Corine was in custody of Norberg during the habeas trial. Writ allowed, returnable on March 9th. After &#x201C;diligent searching,&#x201D; the police could not find Corine Bradley in Douglas County. On March 7, 1901 the State of Nebraska commanded Sheriff to summon Norberg to appear before judge B.S. Baker to show the cause of taking and detaining Corine Bradley. Filed June 4, 1901. </li>
