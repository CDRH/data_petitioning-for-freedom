<p>Before the Hon James E. Wyche
Judge of the Dist Court of the United States
in and for the Territory of Washington at
Chambers in Port Townsend W.T.</p>

<p>Application for writ of Habeas Corpus by
C.M. Bradshaw in behalf of Nicholas Adams
and Thomas Gould of Clallam Co. W.T.</p>

<p>C.M. Bradshaw being duly sworn makes
oath and says that he is informed
and believes that Nicholas Adams
and Thomas Gould are now illegally
restrained of their liberty in the county
of Clallam by a body of men styling them-
selves a "Vigilance Committee" of whom
E.H. McAlmond is styled Captain and
SS Irwin D.F. Brownfield Clark Davis
and some thirty others whose names
deponent can hereafter give are members
and principle actors.</p>

<p>That the cause or pretense of said <unclear></unclear>
as deponent is informed and believes is a
mere suspicion that said Adams and
Gould are bad and dangerous men</p>

<p>That they are restrained of their
liberty without process of law by armed
force and without any authority of law
or proclamation.</p>

<p>Deponent is also informed and
believes that said Vigilance Committee
have threatened to expel by force said par-
ties from the Territory and to execute
them by mob law and that there is 
to believe that such thereto will be carried
into execution before compliance with
the Writ herein applied for can
be enforced.</p>

<p>The herefore deponent prays that
a writ of Habeas Corpus may issue on
behalf of said Adams and Gould
to the end that the cause of their res-
traint may be inquired into and
they delivered therefrom in case said
restraint be illegal.</p>

<p>And also that a warrant may
issue to the proper office of the Court
commanding him to take the persons
thus held in custody and being themforth
with before the court or Judge of the 3rd
Judicial District W.T. holding terms at
Port Townsend and further that a com-
mand be inserted in said warrant for
the apprehension of the persons charged
with causing and exercising said illegal
restraint and that they be brought before
said court or Judge to be dealt with
according to law.</p>

<p>C.M. Bradshaw</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before
me this 14th day of Jun A.D. 1864
E.S. Dyer
Clerk</p>

<p>Set the Writ in
complaint and as in the warrant
an order for the arrest of E.N. McAlmond
S.S. Irwin D.F. Brownfield and Clark Davis the
parties charged with the illegal restraint of
Nicholas Adams and Thomas Gould
the writ returnable forthwith</p>

<p>June 14 1862</p>
