      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that she is restrained

      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that she is held in

      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that in the hearing before
the officers of the Immigration Service of the United States,

or Thos. W. Lynch tending to show or which did show, that your
petitioner was at any time subsequent to her said intermarriage
with said Fred O'Neill an alien to the United States of America.</p>
