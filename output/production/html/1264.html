    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On September 20, 1923, Fannie Green was arrested in a raid on an alleged disorderly house on charges of being either an inmate or keeper of said house and confined to the Omaha city jail. Green remained in jail marked as "hold", with no charges filed against her and unable to pay a bond. H. Miller filed a petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus on Fannie Green's behalf. The respondent, Chief of Police P. F. Dillon, stated that Fannie Green was in charge of the alleged disorderly house at the time of her arrest and that she was being held in custody pending an investigation on a charge that would be a felony. Dillon denied that Green was arrested on charges of being either an inmate or keeper of the house and that she was marked as "hold". On September 29, 1923, the application was granted, and Fannie Green was discharged.</li>
