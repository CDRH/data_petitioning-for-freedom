    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On September 9th, 1913, Charles Gerrish filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of his wife, Bell Leaper Gerrish. Charles explained that they were married on August 14th, 1913, and alleged that on the same day George Leaper, Bell's presumed brother, Albert Leaper, Bell's father, and Bell's unnamed mother forcibly removed Bell from his custody, against his and Bell's will. He alleged that the Leapers refused to allow Bell to leave or to talk with him, and that they threatened to kill him if he attempted to remove Bell from their care. On September 12th, the judge found that Bell was not unlawfully detained and the writ was denied. The appearance docket seems to indicate that Bell testified in open court that she was not being held against her will.</li>
