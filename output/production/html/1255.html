    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Arthur Wyse, confined in the Douglas County jail, was facing extradition to Canada for his alleged involvement in several crimes. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming, among other things, that the procedure leading to his arrest and detention were inconsistent with treaty obligations between the United States and Canada. The court consolidated his petition with those of Axel Pierson, Harry Compton, and John Howard. After hearing the evidence, his writ was denied and Wyse remanded to the custody of his jailer.</li>
