<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON 
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p> 
<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION
OF KUNIJIRO TOGUCHI FOR WRIT OF
HABEAS CORPUS } 
No. 3482.  
Filed December 29, 1916.</p>
<p>WRIT DISCHARGED</p> 
<p>James Kiefer, For Petitioner.</p> 
<p>Clay Allen, U.S. District Attorney, 
Albert Moodie, Asst. " " " ) ) For  Government.</p> 
<p>NETERER, District Judge:</p> 
<p>The petitioner is an alien, whose mother resides in
Japan, and whose uncle lives in Detroit, Michigan, where he
is engaged in conducting a Japanese silk and dry goods and
bamboo funiture business.This company has a branch store in
Japan, where petitioner was employed, and for the last three
years was Manager of this branch store. He came to the United
States at the request of his uncle, to take a position in the
Detroit store as a salesman, and as he advances in knowledge
and business methods, to substitute for one of the partners,
so that they may be relieved from time to time. The uncle sent
to petitioner $100.00 to apply on his expenses, and told him
to apply to him for more money on landing, if needed.No salary
was agreed upon to be paid to the petitioner.</p> 
<p>The Board found the petitioner to be twenty-five years of
age,"intelligent, but on the whole made an unfavorable impression
because of his evasiveness and crafty expression*****;that the
alien is coming to the United States in violation of the alien
contract labor provision of the Immigration Act", and rejected
him on that ground, and ordered his deportation to Japan. On
appeal, the secretary of Labor affirmed the finding of the
Board and Commissioner.</p> 
<p>The petitioner contends that he is not within the prohibitory
clause of the Immigration Act. If the petitioner is not within</p> 
<pb></pb> 
<p>the prohibitory clause of the Immigration Act, the Commissioner
of Immigration has no jurisdiction to detain and deport him by 
erroneously concluding questions of law, Gonzales v. Williams, 
192 U.S. 1, and such act would bring this case to the same status 
as denying a fair hearing, Chin You v. U.S., 206 U.S.8. But
if the alien is within the prohibition of the Immigration Act, 
and the hearing was fairly conducted, the decision of the Sec-
retary of Labor, is binding, Louis v. Frick, 233 U.S. 291. A
court has jurisdiction to determine whether the reasons given by
the Commissioner excluding aliens come within the meaning of the
Immigration Act, Geiow v. Uhl, 239 U. S. 3. The fact that peti-
tioner made an unfavorable impression upon the Board can there-
fore be dismissed without further comment. The only question
for decision is whether the alien comes within the provisions
of the act, supra. The portion of the act which it is claimed
is violated, provides that</p>
<p>"persons***who have been induced or solicited 
to migrate to this country by offers or promises 
of employment or in consequence of agreements****
express or implied to perform labor in this country
of any kind, skilled or unskilled******"</p> 
<p>are excluded.The violation of this act, by its express pro-
visions, is made a crime, and the statute being penal, its
provisions must be strictly construed, U. S. v. Gay, 80 Fed.
254. The act under consideration was brought forward from
the act of Feb. 26, 1885, 23 Stat. 533, which act was intended
to apply only to cheap, unskilled labor, Trinity Church v. U.
S., 143 U. S. 457, in which Mr. Justice Brewer, for the court,
at page 458-459, said:</p> 
<p>"It must be conceded that the act of the cor-
poration is within the letter of this section,
for the relation of the Rector to his church is 
one of service, and implies labor on the one side
with compensation on the other. Not only are the
general words 'labor' and 'service' both used, but
also, as it were to guard against the narrow, inter-
pretation and emphasize the breadth of meaning, to
that is added 'of any kind'".</p>
<p>Specific exemptions are made in the act. The court further</p>
<pb></pb> 
<p>said, pages 464-456:</p>
<p>"It appears also from the petitions and in the 
testimony presented before the committees of Con-
gress that it was this cheap unskilled labor which 
was making the trouble, and influx of which Congress
sought to prevent."</p> 
<p>This act was amended March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1084, and in U.
S. v. Laws, 163 U.S. 258, the court held that a contract with
an alien to come to this country and work upon a sugar plantation
in Louisiana as a chemist was not within the act
citing the Holy Trinity Church, supra. The court, at page
266 said:</p> 
<p>"If, by the terms of the original act, the provisions
thereof applied only to unskilled laborerswhose presence
simply tended to degrade American labor, the meaning of
the act as amended by the act of 1891 becomes, if possible,
stil plainer. Now by its very terms it is not intended
to apply to any person belonging to any recognized prof-
ession. We think a chemist would be included in that
class."</p> 
<p>On March 3, 1903, 32 Stat. 1213, the act was further amended.
The Committee on Immigration, H.R. No. 982, 57th Congress, first
session, stated:</p> 
<p>"The general purpose of this bill is to bring
together in one act scattered legislation heretofore
enacted in regard to the immigration of aliens into
the United States******to eliminate any part thereof
which has become obsolete as a result of subsequent
legislation; to amend such portions thereof as have
been found, either as the result of experience in
enforcing the law or by judicial decision, to be in-
adequate to accomplish the purpose intended, and to
add such further provisions as seem to be demanded by
the concensus of enlightened public opinion, besides
such as are rendered necessary because of territorial
acquisitions of the United States beyond its continental
bounds",</p> 
<p>The Senate Report No. 2119, 57th Congress, First Session, stated:</p>
<p>"The necessity for such reenactment is due in
part to the fact that as the result of judicial 
decisions as well as of adminstrative experience,
the efficiancy </p>
