    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On February 1st 1904, a Criminal Complaint was formally filed against Ernest Hutchinson, a naive of Michigan doing business in Seattle. Charged with violating Seattle City Ordinance 6036, which imposed licensing on the sale and trade of stamps in the city. Hutchinson apparently sold stamps (a system of warehouse coupons which provided a holder with the equivalent value of good from a storehouse to that on the stamp) without securing either the $600 licence to trade stamps, nor buy requiring the purchasers of stamps to secure their $100 stamp licences.

In his petition, filed on April 12, 1904, Hutchinson claimed the ordinance violated both his rights under the US Constitution and the Washington State Consitution. In numerous filings between April and May, Hutchinson's petition was granted and he was released on his own recognizance. His lawyers submitted numerous briefs on his behalf, both to secure his initial petition costs (which was ordered by Judge Hanford on 25 May) and to claim that the entire ordinance licensing the stamps was unlawful. Citing many cases, both at the state and federal levels, Hutchinson claimed the licensing was "an interference with private property&#x201D; and that, under the state constitution, licencing was restricted as a police power and was therefore limited to items related to the &#x201C;peace, happiness and prosperity&#x201D; of its citizens. Ultimately, it is unclear what happened to Hutchison's case. Eleven years after it was first filed, Hutchinson's company, The Sperry and Hutchinson Company sued and were successful at having the case dismissed in September 1915.</li>
