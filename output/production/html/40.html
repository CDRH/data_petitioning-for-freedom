    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Federal Prohibition Agent Homer D. Banner went to the Evers family residence on multiple occasions and purchased alcohol. On June 4, 1924, Richard L. Farrand, Deputy U.S. Marshal, searched the Evers residence after receiving a warrant from U.S. Commissioner Edwin Boehler and found alcohol at the residence. The petitioner, Emma Evers, was convicted by Nebraska&#x2019;s U.S. District Court for unlawful sale and possession of intoxicating liquor under violation of the National Prohibition Law. Judge John F. McGee sentenced her to six months in Douglas County Jail and ordered her to pay a $500 fine. On Dec. 13, 1924, she filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus arguing that she was entitled to a shortened sentence for good conduct, as outlined under the Eighth Federal Statute, and that her sentence had expired at noon the previous day. She also argued that the fine was void because it exceeded the maximum penalty prescribed by the statute for both counts. Her petition and writ were allowed and she was discharged from police custody on December 16, 1924. </li>
