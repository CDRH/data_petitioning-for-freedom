<p>No. 54898/92</p>

<p>November 1, 1920.</p>

<p>In re WU KAO</p>

<p>This Chinese alien applied for admission to the United States about two years ago and admission was denied. He was then permitted to enter temporarily for one year under bond to report for deportation if finally found to be inadmissible. Some weeks after the expiration of his temporary entry privilege, he requested permission to remain permanentyly, he having meanwhile been a merchant in this country for one year or more. Thereupon he was given a hearing "as of the status" which he had when he originally arrived. At the hearing he was excluded for not having a Section 6 certificate. It appeared beyond controversy, however, that he had been exclusively a merchant for more than one year during his aforesaid temporary stay in the United States. His case now comes before the Secretary of Labor on appeal from the excluding decision made at the port of entry at the hearing referred to above.</p>

<p>Since the alien's stay in this country has not been under circumstances either actually or apparently entitling him to residential rights, it would seem that he cannot plead an exempt status acquired here, in lieu of an exempt status acquired in China an duly certified before his arrival here. His permanent admission would seem to depend upon his possession of a Section 6 certificate.</p>

<p>As he has had no such certificate it follows that his appeal must be dismisses and he excluded unless the case of Chin Fong, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in May, 1920, which is cited as conclusive in alien's behalf, is found to control.</p>

<pb/>

<p>That case turned upon the question, as the opinion describes it, of "the security of judicial over administrative action." That is to say, in so far as it governs this case it calls for a decision as to whether this alien would be deprived or judicial rights if the administrative decision against him were enforced. Like this alien, Chin Fong had been a merchan in the United States for at least a year when the question of his mercantile status arose. Like this alien, also, Chin Fong raised the question by applying for admission as a merchant. But in every other respect their cases differ. Chin Fong had lived here a great many years, whereas this alien has lived here less than two years. That difference in itseld would count for nothing under the principle of the Chin Fong decision, but Chin Fong's residence had been upon pretense and under color of a residence right, whereas this alien's is of record as a temporary privilege only. Chin Fong was coming back to this country after a temporary absence from a domicile prima facie established and a mercantile business of the legal standard, and the court held that he could not be excluded on the ground of the possible illegality of his original entry, without a judicial proceeding; but this alien was coming to this country for the first time, was denied admission as an exempt, but was admitted temporarily for a specific purpose -- as an official of a Chinese Province to make an official investigation of certain conditions in this country --- and instead of returning at the expiration of his privileged entry he made application to have the temporary admission made permanent, not upon proof that it should have been made permanent originally but on the ground that he had acquired an exempt status during his temporary stay in this country.</p>

<p>What right, or color of rights, has he to offer for judicial determination such as Chin Fong had? No question of fact is involved. That he has been a merchant in this country for more than a year is conceded. That be became one</p>

<pb/>

<p>while admitted temporarily for a particular<del>l</del> purpose is of record. The administrative authority therefore has the power and the duty to exclude him if in its view he could not lawfully acquire a mercantile status in this country during such temporary admission as was accorded him. If the administrative authority errs in that view of the law, the courts can give relief on the ground that it has exceeded its jurisdiction. All judicial security is preserved.</p>

<p>It might be urged, however, that as a matter of administration it would be folly to deport the alien, since he could immediately return and upon the basis of his American mercantile status be admitted. It if were true that upon returning he would be admissible on the ground, I should not be inclined to dismiss his appeal. To do so would only be useless penalization. But I am of opinion that his right to admission will depend uon his return, as it did upon his first coming and as it does now, not upon his having been a merchant for a year or more during his temporary privileged stay for a particular purpose inthis country, but upon his mercantile status in China as that may be made to appear by the proper certificate when he applies for admission if he should decide to return.</p>

<p>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
