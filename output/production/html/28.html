    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Thomas Sexton claimed to have been unlawfully imprisoned by Joh Briggs and Michael Corcoran. He was detained on suspicion of committing a crime in the state of Colorado. However, Colorado authorities had been given sufficient time to file proper leading proceedings and extradition, but never did. The writ was approved and Sexton was discharged from custody due to lack evidence. </li>
