<p>In the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>

<p>No.5004.</p>
<p>Affidavit.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Petition of Sakutaro Kuwahara for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>United States of America</p>
<p>Western District of Washington</p>
<p>County of King.</p>

<p>SS.</p>

<p>James Kiefer being first duly sworn according to law deposes and says; That he is the attorney for the petitioner above-named; That previous to given notice of time and place of taking depositions in this cause on January 27th, 1920, he arranged with L.A.Michelson, a Notary Public in and for the State of Washington, residing at Seattle to attend upon the taking of such depositions at the time and place stated in said Notice, and on the 30th day of January, 1920, received notice from said L.A.Michelson that he had been unexpectedly detained at Port Townsend, Washington, whither he had gone upon business,and that he would be unable to attend at the time and place stated in said notice and reduce said depositions to writing; Affiant further says that he thereupon arranged with H.V.Abel, a Notary Public in and for the State of Washington, duly commissioned and sworn, and residing at Seattle, to take said depositions, and thereafter requested the acquiescence of Ben L. Moore, Esq., Assistant United States Attorney, in said substitution and which acquiescence was refused by said Assistant United States Attorney: That affiant further says that the inability to attend at the time and place aforesaid of said L.A.Michelson, was wholly without the fault or procurement of affiant and could in no way have been prevented or avoided, and that there was not sufficient time between learning of said inability of said Notary to attend at the time and place aforesaid and the trial of this cause for affiant to give a new notice.</p>

<p>James Kiefer</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 2nd day of February, 1920.</p>

<p>G.A. Laughlin</p>
