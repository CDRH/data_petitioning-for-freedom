    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In the spring of 1898, Richard Townsend enlisted in the U.S. Army to help prosecute the Spanish-American War. He deserted in January 1899, a few weeks after the United States signed a peace treaty but before Congress ratified it. In March 1904, Townsend was arrested in St. Louis, Missouri, charged with desertion, and brought to Fort Crook in Nebraska. He was court-martialed in June, found guilty, dishonorably discharged, and sentenced to two years military labor. A few months later, Townsend petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the statute of limitations had expired. After hearing the evidence, he was remanded to the custody of the U.S. Army. Judge William Hunger, however, declared that Townsend could petition again pending the outcome of a similar case, In re Cadwallader, that was then pending before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</li>
