    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Sarah D. Bassett, was the petitioner for Florence May Mitchell, a 14 year old girl from Dawes County, Nebraska. Bassett filed a petition for Mitchell to Judge Irving F. Baxter alleging that she had been unlawfully imprisoned for two months by Margaret Duffy who was in charge of the Salvation Army Home in Douglas County. Florence May Mitchell was born in Michigan and her father relinquished custody to the Children&#x2019;s Home Society of Michigan, then subsequently, of Nebraska. From there she was taken into the home of C. D. Tyler seven years ago. Then, Mitchell was kidnapped and removed from possession of Sarah D. Bassett on their way to Sioux County, Nebraska to care and provide for her after she had been &#x201C;debauched&#x201D; and was approaching maternity. Allegedly, Mitchell was taken by the father and friends of James Sullenberg (the party accused of her abuse) and kept confined for ten days where she was then transferred to Omaha and put in the hands of Margaret Duffy. Duffy motioned to quash the writ because she said that Bassett did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that she did not have the legal capacity to sue out said writ. Yet, there was an order overruling the motion of Duffy to quash the writ. The writ was allowed and Florence May Mitchell was discharged from imprisonment in May. </li>
