<p>In the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>

<p>No. 6360.</p>

<p>DECISION.</p>

<p>Filed Dec. 30, 1921.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Matoba Watari for Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>The alien lawfully entered the United States December 27, 1900, and on November 12, 1915, he departed and reentered April 7, 1916, and again departed April 24, 1919, and reentered September 27, 1919. June, 1921, he shipped at the Port of Seattle on United States Shipping Board steamer "Cross Keys" as galley man for a round trip voyage to the Orient. At Yokohama he was granted leave of absence by providing a substitute and visited his family in Japan, he agreeing to meet the steamer at Kobe. At Kobe he visited the vessel for the purpose of obtaining consent to prolong his leave. The officers being absent from the vessel he directed his substitute to "tell the officers" that he would board the steamer at Kobe upon its return from Hongkong. When the vessel returned to Kobe the alien reported for duty, but was informed that he had been "logged" as a deserter. He thereafter stowed away on the ship and on arrival at the Port of Seattle was denied admission. Applicant presented a Japanese passport dated <del></del> September 10, 1919, visaed by the American Vice-Consul at Yokchama, bearing date September 11, 1919. The passport is endorsed "admitted, Seattle, Washington, September 29, 1919."</p>

<p>Before the Board of Special Inquiry the alien testified that he was afflicted with gonorrhea, which he contracted in Japan, but further testified that he had been affliced with a similar disease before sailing, but had been pronounced cured. He was denied admission for the reason that he was afflicted with gonorrhea, a loathsome, contagious disease, that he came to the country as a stowaway "and also that he presents no document</p>

<pb/>

<p>with the visaw from the American Consul within the past year." The alien contends that having established a local domicile of approximately 20 years that he may under Section 3, proviso 7, Act February 5, 1917, be admitted in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor and that under Rule 16 of the Immigration Department fixing six months as the time within which an ansence shall be deemed temporary in case the alien had resided continuously for seven years in the United States, established a clear right of the alien to reenter and that having shipped on a United States ship the flag of which carried with it the sovereignty of the United States, the vessel would be United States territory in any part of the world and the alien not having relinquished his domicile cannot be denied reentry.</p>

<p>Allen, Martin &amp; Wardall, Attorneys for Petitioner.</p>
<p>Thomas P. Revelle, U.S. Atty and Judson Faulkner, Asst. U.S. Atty, Attorneys for United States.</p>

<p>NETERER, District Judge, - - -</p>

<p>The alien having left the vessel at Yokohama and having entered the domain of Japan was without the United States and it was necessary for him to comply with the provisions of the immigration laws upon reentry. If he was wrongfully "logged" as a deserter he may have a remedy against the steamship for his wages. His voluntarily leaving the ship flying the flag of his country and entering the Empire of Japan places upon him the necessity of complying with the provisions of the immigration act upon reentry. There is no distinction in the immigration act between aliens and alien seamen. This court In Re Matsutsuyu held December 18, 1919, that absence in Mexico for a short time raised the bars of the immigration act even though the absence was intended to be only temporary and was in fact of short duration. In that case the petitioner had been a resident of the United States since 1906</p>

<pb/>

<p>and went to Tia Juana, Mexico, and returned to the United States without complying with the provisions of the act and was arrested and was ordered deported. At the time of his arrest he was engaged in profitable business. If discretion vests in the Commissioner of Labor this court may not interfere with the exercise of that discretion. The petitioner was accorded a fair hearing.</p>

<p>The writ will be denied and the application dismissed.</p>

<p>Neterer</p>
<p>Judge.</p>
