<p>Jury convened at the residence of Mr. Young at Elk Plains 
in the County of Pierce, W.T. where the deceased lay 
dead, examined the body &amp; the following wounds and 
injuries were found.</p>

<p>First. An incised wound across the bridge of the nose on a 
line with the eyebrows; but glancing downwards to the nose; not 
very deep or dangerous.</p>

<p>Second. A stab in the nape of the neck, glancing downwards 
along the spine; about four inches and a half in depth and made 
apparently with a knife or some sharp instrument.</p>

<p>Third. A stab on the left shoulder, entering the socket 
about two and a half inches, made with same instrument 
as stated above.</p>

<p>Fourth. A stab in the back part of left shoulder striking 
the shoulder blade bone &amp; glancing downwards, about four 
and a half inches in depth, same as above.</p>

<p>Fifth. A stab through the left arm, mid-way between 
the elbow and shoulder: completely severing the muscle, made 
with same as above.</p>

<p>Sixth. A stab in the right side, under the arm-pit, 
striking a rib and glancing downwards, four inches in depth.</p>

<p>Seventh. A stab in the left side, between fourth and

<p>Eighth. A stab in the same side, between the fifth

of this wound was larger than any of the others; for through it there



<note>906</note>

issued a portion of the lobe of the left lung, as large as 
a man's hand. This must have been accomplished by twisting 
the knife or instrument around once or twice before withdrawing 
the same.</p>

<p>Eleventh. Wound in the left hand, the first or small finger 
being almost severed, and the second finger very badly cut, 
done probably be deceased taking hold of the knife, or having

were deep and dangerous, all having penetrated the chest 
and entered the lungs</p>

<p>(The inquisition heard the testimony of several Indian 
women for the purpose of furthering the ends of Justice, 
by ascertaining what number and who were the white 
men that were present at the time the Indian was 
mortally wounded.)</p>
