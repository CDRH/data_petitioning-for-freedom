Inspector as aforesaid, and that upon the conclusion

by direction of the Secretary of Labor of the United
States, ordered deported from the United States, and 
respondent denies that said Valentine Mackay is, and 
denies that at the time of the issuance and execution 
of said warrant said Valentine Mackay was, and denies
that at any time since the issuance of said warrant
said Valentine Mackay has been a citizen of the United
States of America and denies that he has any knowledge or 
information sufficient to form a belief as to whether

States.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE this respondent prays that said order to show cause be discharged; that the said application for writ of Habeas Corpus be denied, and that the said JANET MACKAY, formerly Janet Roy, be remanded to the custody of this respondent to be dealt with according to law and according to the terms and directions of said warrant of deportation.</p>
