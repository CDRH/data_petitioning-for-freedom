<p>Suit for Divorce.&#8212;Mary Jane Morgan, of Newcastle, King county, W. T. has brought suit in the District Court again at Wm. Morgan, for divorce. She alleges that she was married to him in June, 1868, that she conducted herself towards him as a faithful and obedient wife, and that by him she bore three children. She also alleges that he regardless of his marital duties, did during 1871 and 1873, commit adultery with divere women in Australia and Sandwich Islands, and that since the commission of the offense in the latter named country she has not lived or co-habited with him. She concludes her complaint by asserting that Morgan had a former wife living to whom he had been legally married, before his marriage with her. For these reasons she asks of the Court a divorce from said Morgan, and for such other relief as equity may require. This is the same couple who had the trouble before Justice Scott last week. She has been living in King county for several years as the wife of a man named Gray, who, with her, was arrested a few days ago for adultery, on complaint of Morgan, Morgan in turn being arrested for assault and battery. All three parties have been bound over to appear to answer the charges made against them in the District Court.</p>
