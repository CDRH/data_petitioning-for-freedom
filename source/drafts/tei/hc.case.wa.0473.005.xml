Friend, J. Henry Denning.</p>

<p>No. 784</p>

<p>N O T I C E.</p>

<p>To the Hon. A. T. Van de Vanter, sherif of King County, State of 
Washington:</p>

<p>You will please take notice hereby that Charles W. Nordstrom,
now in your custody, duly petitioned the Circuit Court of the United
States for a Writ of Habeas Corpus seeking relief thereunder, and,</p>

<p>Whereas, the said writ and relief was denied, and</p>

<p>Whereas, said petitioner duly moved for the right of appeal and
for the transfer of his whole cause to the Supreme Court of the United
States, and</p>

<p>Whereas, the said cause came on for argument as to the granting
of the said appeal and the transfer of the whole cause to the appellate
Court, and was heard upon the 29th day of Juy 1899, by the Hon.
C. H. Hanford, Circuit Judge, and,</p>

<p>Whereas, after hearing said application, an order of appeal was 
duly granted, and the said cause was so ordered transferred to the
Supreme Court of the United States, a full copy of said proceedings
ad the order allowing said appeal, being duly certified, is hereunto
annexed for your information and advice.</p>

<p>And, whereas, under the Revised Statutes of the United States,
being the law of the United States, particularly, Section 766 of the 
said Revised Statutes of the United States, reads as follows, to-wit:</p>

<p>Sec. 766 "Pending the proceedings on appeal in the 
cases mentioned in the three preceding section, and until final judg-
ment therein, and after final judgment of discharge, any proceedings
against the person so imprisioned or confined or restrained of his 
liberty, in any State Court, or by or under the authority of any
State, for any matter so heard and determined, under such writ of
Habeas Corpus, shall be deemed null and void."</p>

<p>And whereas, the Supreme Court of the United States In Re Jugiro
140 U. S. 295, construing the said section, defined the same to mean
"in cases where the applicant was held in custody under the authority
of a state court or by the authority of a State to stay the hands of 
such court or State while the question as to whether his detention was
in violation of the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United 
States was being examined by the courts of the United States having
jurisdiction in the premises;" which sad decision is more fully
referred to in the case on In Re M'Kane, 61 Fed. 205, where it was
held to mean that until final decision in the Supreme Court f the 
United States no disturbance of the condition of the prisoner as he
was at the time of the denying of the writ can be in anywise had: </p>

<p>Therefore youa re hereby notified that you are to hold posession
or custody of the said petitioner, Charles W. Nordstrom, now in your 
keeping at the City of Seattle, County of King, State of Washington,
in such manner as to your discretion shall seem meet and proper, in
nowise assuming for any cause to execute any sentence of death
whatsoever upon the said petitioner, Charles W. Nordstrom, and you
will be duly notified of any other proceedings in the premises.</p>

<p>You will please govern yourself accordingly.</p>
