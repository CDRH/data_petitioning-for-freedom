    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Petitioner claims that he is unlawfully deprived of his liberty by Chief Gallagher in Omaha. He states that he does not know the cause of his detention and that no complaint has been filed against him anywhere in the state of Nebraska which would charge him with &#x201C;the commission of any crime or being a fugitive from justice.&#x201D; The petitioner was informed that Gallagher arrested him at the request of an officer from Oklahoma based on a request being sent by telegram. The petitioner has not seen the telegrams and has no means of procuring a copy. Therefore, he asked that a writ of habeas corpus be issued so he can be discharged from the unlawful imprisonment. 
Judge Simpson (?) allowed the writ on 23 March 1898. On 25 March 1898 Judge Slabaugh dismissed the cause and sustained the motion of the writ, ordering that Douglas be released.</li>
