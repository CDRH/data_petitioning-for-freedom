<p>William Martin</p>
<p>Attorney</p>
<p>Seattle, Wash.</p>

<p>Hugh C. Todd.</p>

<p>In the District Court of the United States for Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>

<p>No. 6323</p>

<p>Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of <del>Chin Wah</del> Moy Hing Hun for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>To the honorable Jeremiah Neterer, District Judge:</p>

<p>Comes now, <del>Chin Wah</del> Moy Hing <add>Hun</add>, petitioner, and petitions this Court to issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus to inquire into the cause of the detention of one <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun by Hon. Henry M. White Commissioner of Immigration, at Seattle, Washington, and shows to the Court as follows:</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>That <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> <add>Moy Hing Hun, a citizen of the United States</add> is the lawful blood son of <del>your petitioner</del> Moy You Jin, <del>eighteen years of age,</del> a citizen of the United States and is now detained at the United States Immigration Station at Seattle, Washington, by Hon. Henry M. White, Commissioner of Immigration at Seattle, in the proceedings from the application of the said <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun to be admitted into the United States as the minor son of your petitioner who is a recognized <del>legitimate merchant</del> citizen of the United States within the meaning of the laws of the United States and the treaties between the United States and China governing the admission of the subjects of China into the United States, being a <del>member of the Koe Fong Company, 667 King Street, Seattle, Washington.</del> resident of Chicago Ill.</p>

<p>11.</p>

<p>That the said <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun is imprisoned and restrained of his liberty by the said Commissioner of Immigration at</p>

<pb/>

<p>said Immigration Station; that he has not been committed and is not detained by virtue of any judgment, decree, final order or process issued by a Court or Judge of the United States, in a case where such courts or judges have exclusive jurisdiction under the laws of the United States, or have acquired exclusive jurisdiction by commencement of legal proceedings in such a court nor is he detained by virtue of the final judgment or decree of a court or competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction, or the final order of such a tribunal made in the special proceedings instituted for any cause except to punish him for contempt; or by virtue of an execution or other process issued upon such a judgment, decree or final order; or by virtue of a warrant issued from any court upon an indictment or information.</p>

<p>111.</p>

<p>That the cause or pretense of the imprisonment or restraint of the said <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun, according to the best knowledge and belief of your petitioner, that the said Commissioner ruled that the said <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun was an alien Chinese person, not a member of any of the exempt classes of Chinese entitled to come into or remain in the United States, and accordingly refused him admission, from which finding an appeal was taken to the Secretary of Labor and said appeal was thereupon denied by the Secretary of Labor on the 3 day of <del>June</del> Oct, <del>1916</del> 1921; that the decision of the said officials denying admission is upon the ground and for the reason that the said <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun <del>was married before coming to the United States and has a wife in China</del> is not a citizen of the United States, which ruling is illegal, wrongful, contrary to the laws of the United States and in violation of the treaties between the Government of the United States and the Government of China respecting and governing the admission and exclusion</p>

<pb/>

<p>of subjects of China into and from the United States.</p>

<p>1V.</p>

<p>That the facts developed by the hearings in this matter by said Immigration officials are insufficient to justify the decision that the said <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun is not of the said exempt classes and the said decision is arbitrary, and also contrary to law; that the said immigration officials in making said findings, aside from being contrary to law and treaty, greatly abused their descretion in holding that the said <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun was not of the exempt classes.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p>That the said <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun is being restrained of his liberty without due process of law, in violation of the provisions of the constitution of the United States, the laws and treaties governing such cases made and provided; that he is wrongfully, illegally and arbitrarily restrained of his liberty, and that the said Immigration officials are about to deport him and that unless this Court intervenes he will be deported forthwith.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE your petitioner prays that a Writ of Corpus may issue, directed to Hon. Henry M. White, Commissioner of Immigration at Seattle, Washington, commanding him to have the body of the said <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun before Hon. <add>Edward E. Cushman</add> <del>Jeremiah Neterer,</del> Judge of the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, Northern Division, at the Federal Court Building in Seattle. Washington, at 10 o'clock A.M. <del>July</del>, 19<del>16</del>21, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered concerning the said <del>Chin Doe Tung</del> Moy Hing Hun, together with the time and cause of his detention.</p>

<p>Dated <del>June</del> Oct 6. 19<del>16</del>21</p>

<p>Moy Hing Hun</p>
<p>Petitioner.</p>

<p>By Hugh C. Todd</p>
<p>His Attorney.</p>
