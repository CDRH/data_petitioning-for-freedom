the county jail of the County of Multnomah and State of Oregon,
and clandestinely and secretly detained her and has refused upon

her husband, Wong Sing Lung, to let it be known where she is
detained.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further shows that he, together with
his representative, who is the representative of Gwoo Shee Ah
Look, has applied to the said R.P. Bonham, Acting Inspector 
of Immigration Service at Portland, Oregon, and requested the
said R.P. Bonham to advise or tell them the whereabouts of the

saw Chinese going up there in the rooms that the women
were in. We went up there and talked to the women the
best we could. At different times we found different 
men in this woman's room. Finally, about 4:30 in the
morning November 4th, we went up with the purpose of
making her arrest and we found a Chinese in bed with her.</p>
<p>"Q In your capacity, experience, and observation as a police
officer in the Chinese quarter on North Fourth Street,
Portland, what have you found to be the reputation of
the place out of which this womna was arrested?</p>

ply their trade."</p>
