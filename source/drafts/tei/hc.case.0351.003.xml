<p>John Herring
vs
J.C. Jewett
Sheriff Whatcom
County</p>

<p>Before Judge Fitzhugh
Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court and District Judge of the 3rd
Judicial District Washington Territory</p>

<p>Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>John Herring plaintiff in the above writ
1st he cause complains of J.C. Jewett defendant
herein, and for cause of complaint sets forth, that
the said plaintiff is restrained of his liberty by
the said J.C. Jewett, acting as Sheriff of the
County of Whatcom in said Territory that
said restraint is imposed in the Town of What-
com in the same, under the order of the Judges of
the Probate Criminal Court of said County to wit
N. Young presiding Judge and H.R Crosbie
Associate</p>

<p>2nd The cause or pretense of the restraint
has been, that one Moses Phillips made a com-
plaint against said plaintiff on oath in the said
Criminal Court as for a public nuisance, and
complained that said plaintiff kept a number
of hogs, roaming about the streets, and lying under
houses breeding filth and that he had built
a pig jam in the streets</p>

<p>To this complaint the defendant therein
by his counsel demand, on the ground, that hogs
lying under teh houses of some citizens, and breed-
ing filth be it true, was a private nuisance, and
not a public one. Also that the allegation that
the hogs roamed about the streets did not contain
facts sufficnet to constitute a criminal acion;
which was overuled by the Court.</p>

<p>Defendant then filed his answer stating
that the hogs in question did not belong to him,
that the pig jam was not an obstruction to the
street nor was any person prevented from passing
along the same - that said pass way was
not a public street so for as he knew, and that
it was only used by foot people, and not by
waggons - and that he was not guilty of a
public offense - on the trial defendant's counsel
asked six instructions, onyl of of which was
given. See paper on file.</p>

<p>The trial was had on the 27th day of April
1859 and the Jury brought in a verdict of guilty
fine $5 Costs $115 Total $120</p>

<p>(When the verdict was rendered) When the ver-
dict was rendered the Court ordered the said
veridct to be recorded as a judgment and
immediately adjourned the Court.</p>

<p>On the convening the Court next morning the
28th the defendant's Counsel moved the Court for
a new trial on three grounds:
First Newly discovered evidence. Second
Misdirection of the Jury and admission of illegal
evidence, and Third, Refusal of the Court to
allow defendant to be heard by Counsel
before the Jury. By all which said then defendant
Herring was materially <unclear></unclear> in regard to his
substantial rights.</p>

<p>This application was refused on the grounds that
it should have been made before judgment; which
if it be a judgment would be impossible as no time
intervened to permit it</p>

<p>These are the causes according to the best of
the knowledge of complainant</p>

<p>The restraint is alleged to be illegal on the
grounds, just, that the verdict was recorded
as a judgment and not as a verdict - therefore
the verdict was not recorded as such. Second,
that no sentence was legally imposed nor judg-
ment entered. Third, that defendant was not
called nor did he appear for sentence nor was he
asked. "Whether he had any legal cause to show
why judgment should not be</p>
