    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Lem You held the three bound parties in addition to 40-50 other Chinese women, all of whom he intended to sell. Wah Kim claimed that You was wrongfully imprisoning these three girls and filed a habeas petition on their behalf. Writ was granted for girls to be released "forthwith." You denied every allegation, even denying that the girls concerned were those that Wah Lee claimed. He claimed that the girls were in Omaha for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition to show Chinese customs. Witnesses were called. It appears that the three girls were placed into the sheriff's custody and designated to the care of a Dr. Wycoff. Unknown final result.</li>
