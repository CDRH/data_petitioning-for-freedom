    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Teramoto came to the U.S. in 1911 through a San Francisco port, where he resided in the U.S. until June 1921 while he was working as a mess boy on a steamship going to Japan and coming back. He arrived to the U.S. in August 2021 where he was arrested by Acting Commissioner of Immigration Thomas W. Lynch in Seattle and ordered for deportation. Teramoto applied for habeas claiming said arrest to be unlawful.
Writ was denied and Teramoto was deported, advised by his attorney that he did not have any means to prosecute an appeal or take any further action.</li>
