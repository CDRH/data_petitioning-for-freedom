    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Lulu Dawson petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to establish custody of her daughter, Lucile Dawson, which was granted. At the hearing, the respondents, William and Myrtle Headrick, asserted that they made "no claim" to Lucile. They apparently ran a boarding house where Lulu had placed her daughter until she secured her a place at an orthopedic hospital. Lulu therefore withdrew her petition on the advice of her attorney and paid the court costs.</li>
