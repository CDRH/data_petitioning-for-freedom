<p>5. All erasures and interlineations must be noted, word for word, immediately above the signatures of the witnesses, as having been made before execution of the bond. The general statement that "erasures and interlineations were made before execution" is insufficient.</p>

<p>7. The affidavits of the signers of the bond must be taken and subscribed before an officer authorized to administer oaths generally, who must certify that he administered the oath and affix his official seal.

<p>And whereas, pending the final disposal of his case the said alien desires to avail himself of the privilege of being released from custody accorded by section 20 of the said Act of Congress, and has applied to the immigration official by whom said warrant has been served for his release upon giving a proper bond or undertaking that he will deliver himself into the custody of the said immigration official or other proper immigration official representing the United States Government for hearing or hearings and for deportation in case he is found to be unlawfully within the United States:</p>
