Northern Division

In re petition of
Ng Kwack Kang
for Writ of Habeas Corpus

#3157
Brief of United States.

Statement of the Case.
Ng Kwack Kang applied for admission at Seattle as
the son of an American-born Chinese residing in Boston.
The Immigration authorities denied him admission because
the alleged relationship was not established. Petition
for writ of habeas corpus was then filed, embracing many 
charges, among which the following legal points are noted:
I. The function of habeas corpus is to test the 
legality of confinement, and unless that appears contrary
to law the writ should not be granted.
In the instant case petitioner is held for
deportation as a rejected chinese alien who applied for
admission, the authority for custody being a Department
of Labor warrant the validity of which is not attacked.
This warrant is based on the rejection made by the immigration
officials at the port of entry, affirmed on 
appeal to the Department of Labor. In chinese cases it 
has been construed proper, upon habeas corpus, to enquire
into the question of fairness of hearing and abuse of
discretion by the examining immigration officils and in
the event no fault is found on those scores, to remand
the petitioner for deportation.

49 L Ed 1040 et seq.
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
II. If the hearing was fair and no abuse of discretion
appears, the writ must be dismissed.
The power to admit, exclude, or expel aliens
has been confided entirely to the political department
of the government, except in the single instance of 
hearings before United States Commissioners on deportation
charges filed against chinese unlawfully found in the
country. In such cases an appeal to the District Court,
with trial de novo, is authorized. Sec. 13, Act 13 Sept
1888, ch. 1015. The case of aliens who have not landedm
and all other cases, being political matters of the highest 
order, are confided to the executive department of the
government, and its action, if fair and free from abuse
of discretion is final. The entire record in petitioners 
case is on file herein for examination on those points.

Section 8, Act 13 Sept 1888, page 15 Chinese
Exclusion Laws pamphlet; and Sec. 7 of Act 5 May 1892,
page 21 same pamphlet, are the legal basis for Rule 9-b
of the immigration department, which reads:
"The lawful wife of an American citizen of the chinese 
race may be admitted for the purpose of joining her 
husband; and the lawful children of such a citizen partake 
in his citizenship and are therefore entitled to admission.
In every such case, convincing evidence of citizenship and 
relationship shall be exacted."
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
Under this rule the immigration officials at
Seattle made the rejection, not being convinced of the 
relationship claimed. Upon appeal, the Secretary of 
Labor affirmed the rejection, and this is final. The
record also fails to show convincing evidence of citizenship

Sections 22, 23, and 38 of the Immigration Act
of Feb 20 1907 as amended, pages 13, 14, 17, pamphlet laws,
contain further authority for the rules and regulations of
the Department of Labor. These rules bear on chinese 
cases, in as much as the law requires a chinese to first 
pass the requirements of this law before being examined
under the exclusion act.

In the Tang Tun case 168 F 488, at p. 496 it is
said: "Under such circumstances we do not understand, in
view of the law as declared by the Supreme Court I'
n the cases hereinbefore referred to, that ANY
court is authorized to review the action of the 
Department of Commerce and Labor in the matter of
admitting or weighing evidence, or to consider
whether the conslusions drawn by its officers
were right or wrong."
