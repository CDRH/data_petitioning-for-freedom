    <li>Summary of Proceedings: John Bowler and Edward McCrink (called McCrinkle in the petition) were arrested for the charge of perjury after they testified at trial that they were beaten with brass knuckles by James H. Bennett. They filed for a habeas petition on the basis that the commissioner who arrested them did not have jurisdiction or probable cause to detain them. The petition was granted, and upon hearing the evidence, the judge granted the writ of Habeas Corpus as well. Following the writ, the judge returned to the original trial of assault and the petitioner&#x2019;s attorney called multiple witnesses. </li>
