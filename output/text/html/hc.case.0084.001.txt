In the District Court of the Third Judicial District of Washington Territory, Holding
Terms at Seattle, in the County of King.

In the Matter of the Petition for writ of Habeas Corpus for the person of Nan Oy a
Chinese woman

Upon the reading and consideration of the matters set forth in the petition of Ah
Kam for a writ of Habeas Corpus herein, it is considered by the Court that said writ
be granted



The alleged cause of the restraint of the said Nan Oy, wife of this Petitioner by
said F.P. Loftus, United States Deputy Marshal aforesaid is that said Nan Oy, wife
of this Petitioner as aforesaid attempted to come to your Petitioners home in the
City of Seattle, King County, Washington Territory, from said City of Victoria, British
Columbia where said Nan Oy arrived at the City of Port Townsend in Washington Territory
she, the said Nan Oy, was seized and restrained of her liberty by F.P. Loftus Dep
United States Marshall aforesaid, and she is still held in custody by him and is deprived
of and restrained of her liberty by said United States Marshall and he threatens to
send her, the said Nan Oy, back to Victoria, British Columbia.

You Petitioner says that said restraint of said Nan Oy by said F.P. Loftus, Deputy
United States Marshall is illegal in this, that said Nan Oy is entitled as the wife
of your petitioner to come to the home of her husband, your petitioner, in the said
City of Seattle, because he is a merchant

and entitled to reside in the United States of America and to have his said wife reside
with him

Wherefore your petitioner prays that a writ of habeas corpus issue, directing said
F.P. Loftus to bring said Nan Oy into Court
