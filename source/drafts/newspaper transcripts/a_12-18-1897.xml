JUDGE ORANGE JACOBS.

Judge Jacobs presides over the criminal department of the King county superior court, having been elected last fall. He is the Nestor of the Seattle bar and is universally regarded as the soul of honor, while few equal and none excel him in learning of the law. He is a pioneer in this section, having lived nearly forty years in Washington and Oregon. In territorial days he served as delegate to congress, district judge and senator and was the city's first corporation counsel. The same high qualities which as a private citizen have always actuated Judge Jacobs and endeared him to all, characterize him in public life, and during his years of varied and trying office-holding not even a whisper has been heard against his fair name.
