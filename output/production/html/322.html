    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Matoba was a resident in the U.S. since 1900. On June 1921, he served as a galley man on a ship going from Japan and back and had a delayed return due to contracting gonorrhea which had him logged as a deserter and stowaway. When he arrived, U.S. Commissioner of Immigration Thomas Lynch had Matoba detained and issued for deportation. Matoba petitioned claiming unlawful arrest and refuted the accusations that he was a deserter or stowaway aboard the ship.
Writ was denied and Matoba remained in the custody of Lynch.</li>
