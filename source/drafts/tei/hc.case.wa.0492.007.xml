<p>In Re. Application Of
Francis Stephen Medcraf
For Writ Of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>Brief for Petitioner.</p>

<p>The petitioner was convicted before Reah M. Whitehead, a 
Justice of the Peace, of the crime of 'practicing dentistry' without
having a license so to do. Having been committed on such conviction
to the county jail, petitioner sues out the Writ, alleging that he
is restrained of his liberty, his property destroyed, and he is 
denied the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Federal
Constitution.</p>

<p>Article .XIV. Sec. 1. Constitution of U.S. (Amendments)
"-nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty
or property, without due process of law, nor deny to any 
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the 
laws."</p>

<p> Article V. do do do
"No person----shall be deprived of life, liberty or
property without due process of law."</p>

<p> Article I. Sec. 18. Constitution of Washington.
"No law shall be passed granting to any citizen, class of citizes
or corporatins, other than municipal, privileges or 
immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not belong 
equally to all citizens or corporations."</p>

<p>Article I. Sec. 7. Consitution of Washington.
"No person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his 
home invaded, without authority of law."</p>

<p>Article I. Sec. 3. Constitution of Washington.
"No personal shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law."</p>

<p>The Gen. Laws of Washington for 1893 enacted a code by which all 
practitioners of dentistry within the state should become licensed
This superseded the former enactments of 1888, and Chap. LV
of the Laws of 1893. It provided for the examination by a competent
Board to be appointed by the Governer, of all who desired to 
<pb></pb> practice Dentistry. As a pre-requisite to such examination the applicant
was required to present to the Board his or her diploma from
some dental college in good standing and give satisfactory evidence
of his or her rightful possession of the same "Provided; That the
Board may admit to such examination such other persons of good moral
character as shall give satisfactory evidence of having been
engaged in the practice of dentistry ten years prior to the date of
such examination."</p>

<p>A standard for such examination was provided and all persons satisfactory passing same were to be licensed.</p>

<p>The certificate or license was required to be recorded in the
County Auditors office in each county where the licensee practiced.</p>

<p >The Act was mended and a substiute enacted in and by CHAP.
CL11 of the Laws of 1901. (p 314-7)</p>

<p>"Sec. 4. Any person or persons seeking to practice Dentistry in 
the state of Washington, or to own, operate or cause to be operated, 
or to run or manage  a dental office or place for the practice of dentistry
in the State of Washington after the passage of this Act
shall file his or her name, together with an application for examination,
with the secretary of the State Board of Dental Examiners
and at the time of making such application shall pay to the Secretary
of the Board a fee of $25.00 and to present him or herself 
at the first regular member meeting thereafter of said board to undergo
examination before that body. No person shall be eligible for such 
examination unless he or she shall be of good moral character and
shall present to said Board his or her diploma form some dental
College in good standing and shall give satisfactory evidence of his 
or her rightful possession of the same; PROVIDED, This section 
shall not apply to persons engaged in the practice of dentistry
at the time of the passage of this act who are bona fide citizens of 
the State of Washington. </p>

<p>Provision is made for the issue of license to persons passing
much examination and for recording same and the practice of dentistry 
without such license being duly issued and of record is made a
misdemeaor punishable by fine of not less than $50. nor more than
$200.00 or by imprisonment in the County Jail for six months.</p>

<p>It appears that the Board of Dental Examineers employed one 
conover to go to the petitioner's office and soicity him to perfor soem
operation of dentistry upon him, or order that complaint might be made
<pb/>
by Conover of such violation of the statue. This was done. On
such a complaint the warrant issued. Petitioner upon his trial
before the Justice duly raised all the constitutional questions
set forth in his petition and they were overruled and his convistion
and sentence followed, Upon being committed under such sentence he
sues out this Writ.</p>

<p>It appeared upon the trial and is shown by the petiton 
that the petitioner served 5 years as an apprentice to a competent
and reputable dentist in London. that he has continuously practiced 
dentistry, in the employ of competent dentists for 8 years thereafter
and on his own account for 141/2 years since, in England, France, 
Greece, Candana, and for the past 71/2 years in the United States in
this city. That he has duly applied to the said Board for examination
and offered to pay the fee required but becasue he had never 
ateneded any Dental College and could not produce a diploma from such
college, he was refused any such examination and license.</p>

<p>It is insisted that the Dental Act of 1901 is void as being in 
conflict with both the federal and State constitutions;</p>

<p>Argument.</p>

<p>The Power of Police Regulation of the practice of dentistry by the 
State is not questioned, bu tthis Act far transcends the powers of 
the State in that particular, It is unreasonable; an unnecessary 
restriction of and infringemet upon the rights of the individual;
deprives him of his property unnecessarily and is violative of his 
constitutional rights. It constitutes unlawful discrimination.</p>

<p>The object of the law is the protection of the health
and safety of the public.
To this end, the qualifications of those who assume to practice
Dentistry are material and of importance. Reasonable tests and
regulations to secure this and are lawful and if such interfere with 
the right to practice, they are still valid. But when they go beyond
the line of reason and are no longer necessary nor regulative of the 
right to practice but unduly restrict that right in the individual,
<pb/>
they become in conflict with the <add>quotes</add> provisions of 
the Federal Constituion and must fall.</p>

<p>If the applicant for the examination is of good moral character and 
has the knowledge and qualifing ability to practice dentistry, of
what benefit is it to the public that he has or has not a diploma 
from some dental college? How does the possession of such a paper
protect the public, if the holder must pass the examination for the actual
qualifying knowledge and ability? Why should the citizen who
has come up the long road of practical experience, beginning with 
a 5-year apprentice ship and 221/2 years of actual and active practice,
widely diversified and enriched with wide experience, and 
who has constantly studied and kept apace with the best skill of the
day; why should he be precluded from taking the examination test
while the boy or girl of no practical experience who holds the 
diploma may enjoy that privalege?</p>

<p>It is an unfair and unnecessary restriction upon the right of every 
man to follow his profession for his livelihood.</p>

<p>True the Supreme Court of Washington has held that the provision 
requiring the diploma is a reasonable one. But such is not the
opinion of the courts before whom such a question has come and is not 
supported by any satisfactory reasoning. It is in no way binding 
upon the Federal Court not of any weight in construing the effect of 
the Federal Constitution upon the act in question. It is the peculiar 
province of the Federal Courts to interpret the Federal Constitution
and in so doing they are not bound, even in conscience, by 
the opinions of the state courts.</p>

<p>Such a law (in effect) was before the Supreme Court of New. Hamp.
and a conclusion quire opposire to that of the State of Washington 
was reached.</p>

<p>STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE VS. PENNOYER 5 L. R. A. 709.
The act there in question provided for the issue of
licenses to practice medicine to those who should;
eithr pass a satisfactory examination, or
<pb/>
present a diploma from some medical school etc.,
Those passing examination to pay a fee of $5.00 and those presenting
a diploma to pay $1.00 for the license.</p>

<p>Practice without being so licensed was made a misdemeanor and 
punished by fine of $300 or less etc.</p>

<p>"The provisions of the preceeding section(penal) shall not 
apply to persons who have resided and practiced their profession
in the town or city of their present residence during all the 
time since January 1st, 1875.---"</p>

<p>This law tok effect in January 1879.</p>

<p>Parallel Requirements</p>

<p>Washington Act.
Persons who are engaged in the
practice of dentistry at the 
time of the passage of this act
who are bona fide citizens of 
the State of Washington, are exempt
from the penalties of the 
act.</p>

<p>New Hampshire
All physicians except those who practiced
all the time between Jany. 1st, 
1875 and Jany. 1st,1879, and during
that period did not remove from one 
town to another, are required to obtain
a license and pay therefor $5.00 or
$1.00 according as it may be issued upon examination or upon diploma.</p>

<p>The courst Said:
"The law cannot discriminate in favor of one citizen to the 
detriment of another. The principle of equality pervades the entire
Constitution. The Bill of Rights declares expressly that all governemtn 
is 'instituted for the general good,; for the common benefit,
protection and secuirty of the whole community, and not for the 
private interests, or emolument of any one man, family or class
of men; that "every member of the community has a right to be protected 
by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property."
citizen or
"no one <add>^</add>class of citizens can by law be charged with the
performace of duites or be subjected to burdes not by law made
incumbent upon all other citizens in the same circumstance."</p>

<p>Missouri vs Lewis 101 U.S. 22; 25 L. 989
Barbier vs Connolly 113 U.S. 31: 20 L/ 925
Yick Wo. vs Hopkins 118 U.S. 356; 30 L. 220</p>

<p>The objection is that, "of course physicians who are declared 
by Statue, or under its provisions, are found, qualified to practice
som are and other are not subjected to the burden of obtaining a 
license. Exemption form the burden is made to depend not on integrity,
education and medical skill, but upon a continuous dwelling
in one place for (at) a certain time. it is an arbitrary 
discrimination permitting some and forbidding others to carry on 
their business without regard to their competency or to any material 
difference in their situation. The test is not merit but unchanged
residence. For the right to continue the pursuit of his profession 
one physician is not, while another, his neighbor, who may be his
equal or superior in learning, expereince and ability, is required
to pay $5.00. This is not the equality of the Constitution.
The magnitutde of the unequal burden is immaterial. If any inequality is 
permitted the discrimination might be made prohibitory, and a 
monopoly of the business given to the physicians who have resided 
<pb/>
in a town or city for a specified time."

<p>Note that under the present law, a man may be a bona fide citizen
of this Sate at the time fo the passage of the Act an yet be 
practicing dentistry in some other state, and if such be true, he may 
practice here without either examination or license.</p>

<p>If he is a bona fide citizen of this state and is practicing here, 
he needs neither examination or license, according to this act.</p>

<p>It is no less an unconstitutional distinction to make the right
to examination depend entirely upon the applicant having a diploma
from some dental college. he must, under the act, prossess such 
a diploma to entitle him to be examined for license. His real qualifications,
obtained by long practice in this or any other state or 
country, count for nothing. He may be the best dentist in the world
and yet, if he has not passed through a dental college, he cannot
take the examination and unless, he resided and practiced here at
the time of the passage of the act (or resided here and practiced else
where) he cannot obtain a license.</p>

<p>The right to license is tus made to depend, not on actual
merit but upon the possession of a diploma or residence.</p>

<p>The right of the person to practice his profession is interfered 
with, not for the public benefit, nor by reasonable means, but
for the benefit of the Dental practioners who may be fortunate enoug
to have their diploma or to reside here at the time. Such is not a
fair or reasonable requirement nor is it the 'equality' whicch the 
Constitution required</p>

<p>Sec.. 1977 Comp. Laws of U.S. guarantees equal rights under the 
law to all "persons" within the jurisdiction of the United States
and under the laws of every State. Such "persons" shall have the 
right "in every state and territory- - - to the full and equal 
benefit of all laws and procedures for the security of persons and 
property- - -"</p>

<p>The citizenship of the "person" is therefore of no consideration.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p >The Supreme Court of Washington has held a portion of this act to be 
unconstitutional, and avoided so destroying the remainder only by a
very forced construction of its provisions.</p>

<p>In STATE VS BROWN 37 Wash. 105. the Court says;</p>

<p>"We feel that a court should be reluctant to pronounce 
a statue invalid, except where its plain duty impels such action.
Conceiving this to be such a case, we are led to declare that part
of the statute requireing an examination and license in order to
'own, run or manage' a dental office or department, void."</p>

<p>In the very same case the court cites abundant authority to 
sustain our contention here, saying; "The police power does not 
justify the withholding from one individual of a natural privilege
or right, in order that a corresponding advantge may be added to
the rights or privileges of another. The restriction is permissible 
only as a preventive of evil results reasonably to be exprected 
without such limiation. Russell on Police Power pp 34.35 says; "to
justify the State in thus interposing its authority, in behalf of 
the public, it ust appear, first, that the interests of the public
generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class. require
such interferance, and second, that the mmeans are reasonably
necessary for the accomplishment of the purposes, and not unduly
oppressive upon individuals."</p>

<p>The test of those who assume to practice dentistry must necessarily 
be, not the possession of a diploma from some college, but 
"possession  of the actual technical knowledge and skill peculiar to 
the study and practice of dentistry."</p>

<p>Common knowledge teaches that there are many excellent dentists 
in this country who have obtained their knowledge and skill by long
study and practice under competent dentists in their offices and not
in any dental college. The practice of apprenticeship of dental students
obtain in most states and in many foreign countries and in that
manner many of our best dentists obtained their technical training. 
Does the public good require that all such shall be excluded from
practice, or from examination for license?</p>

<p>In State vs Calused 65 Wash. 178, the Supreme Court again said;</p>

<p>"It is not meant to be asserted that this power (police)
is above the Constitution, or tat everkything done in the name
of the police power is lawfully done. It is meant only to be asserted
that a law which interferes with personal and property 
rights is valid only when it tends reasonably to correct some 
existing evil or promote some interest of the State, and it not in 
violation of any direct and positive mandate of the constitution.
The clause of the constitution now under consideration was intended 
to prevent the arbitrary exercise of power, or undue, unjust,
and capricious interferances with personal rights; not to prevent
those reasonable regulations that all must submit to as a condition 
of remianing a member of society. In other words the test of a police 
regulation, when measured by this clause of the constitution, 
is reasonableness, as contrastinguished from arbitrary or capricious
action."</p>

<p>Measured by this test, the statute in question clearly violtes 
the constitutional provision. It is both unreasonable, unnecessary, 
capricious and unjust to that large class of dentists who
have gained their knowledge and skill without the aid of a college
education. Do petitioners apprenticeship in one of the best offices
in England and 221/2 years constant practices since, count for
nothing? Is he to be forbidden to demonstrate to the Board his 
knowledge and skill because he did not obtain them from some dental
college? Or because he did not live int he state at the time 
of the passage of the act?</p>

<p>But the Supreme Court of Washington. in State R1. Thompson vs
State Board 48 Wash. 291-3, has passed upon this contention and 
held adversely to the petitioner. In that case the qualification
of the Relator was admitted, save as to possession of a diploma,
and the court refused to compel the Board to grant him examination
holding the statute valid. No reasons are given but the case is
based on the decision in State vs Thompson 36 Wash. 377, the court
saying:</p>

<p>"The statute makes the same requirements of all applicants for 
examination. No favored or preferred classes are created or recognized.
The requiremetn of both diploma and examination as a test
of knowledge and skill is not such an unreasonable or arbitrary one
as to invalidate the statue. The right to determine what requirements 
must be met by an applicant is within the exclusive province of 
the legistlature."</p>

<p>If this be ture, what force has the constitutional provision? 
if the legislature determine upon an unreasonable and infair test
which is an arbitrary interferance with the right of the individual, 
how is he to obtain protection in his right?</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>In State vs. Thompson 36. Wash. 360, the court bases its decision
upon Ex parte Whitely 77 Pac. 879. That case is ruled by Dent vs
West Virginia 129 U.S. 124; 32 Led. 623.</p>

<p>Examination of the federal case will show that the statue of
West Virginia under consideration and which was sustained, provided
that license should be issued to three classes;</p>

<p>(a) Those possessing diplomas from some suitable school;
(b) Those who had resided and practiced in the state for 10
years last past;
(c)Those who should pass a satisfactory examination before 
the Board.</p>

<p>The possession of a diploma was made one ground of the issue of a
 license without examination;</p>

<p>The fact of practicing for ten years before the passage of the act
was made another ground for issuing the license;</p>

<p>The posession of the requisite knowledge and skill as shown by a 
satisfactory examination before the board, was the third ground.
It was not made a pre-requisite to examination that the applicant
should hold a diploma from some dental college.</p>

<p>Upon this foundation, the Supreme Court rests its decision in 
the Thompson case. The authority relied on is exactly contrary to 
its own conclusions</p>

<p>Not a single reason is given by the State court to support its
conclusion that the requirement of a diploma is reasonable. It is 
without a supporting case and without a single valid reason.</p>

<p>There is not and never was, in the State of Washingto, any
Dental College or any College of Medicine or other school which 
can or ever did grant any such diploma as the act requires. How is such 
a diploma to be obtained? What does a man gain by getting it, 
that will be of benefit to the public, more than he has gained by
an apprenticeship of five and a continued practice of 22 years? 
What requirement is made of the man who was actually practiving
dentistry and a citizen of this state when the act was passed?</p>

<p>As the court aptly remarked in the Dent case supra;</p>

<p>"In this country the requirement (constitutional provision) is
intended to have a similar effect against legislative power, that 
to secure the citizen against any arbitrary deprivation of his rights
<pb></pb>
whether relating to his life, his liberty or his property."</p>

<p>The correct rule was stated by the Missouri Supreme Court in 
STATE VS SMITH, 33 L. R. A. (NS) 187, thus;</p>

<p>"If, under the guise of the police power, the legislature unreasonably
and capriciously restrains one's liberty or property.
the Court may interpose the Constitution and declar the
law void."</p>

<p>So in STATE VS FISHER 52 Mo. 174, the same court said;</p>

<p>"A law which unnecessarily and oppresively restrains a 
citizen from engaging in any trafic or disposing of his propeerty as he
may see fit, though passed under the specious pretext of a preservative
of the health of the inhabitants, would be void."</p>

<p>The profession of Dental Surgery, like that of law or medicine,
is a profitable employment, to the public as well as to the practitioners;
The only elements of danger arising from the practice of 
them lies in the admission of incompetent persons into them.</p>

<p>The provison in question does extend further. it absolutely excludes 
the man, no matter how competent, that can not produce a 
diploma from some dental college-outside the State, for there is
none in the State. Qualifications do not matter. The DIPLOMA is 
the essential.</p>

<p>"There is no easier nor more tempting opportunity for the practice
of tyranny than in the police control of occupations. Good and 
bad motives often combine to accomplish this kind of tyranny. The 
zeal of the reformer as well as cupidity and self-interest must alike
be guarded against. Both are apt to prompt the employment of means
to attain the end desired, which the constitution prohibits."
Tideman on Police Powers Sec. 102.</p>

<p>"---if the business is not inherently harmful, the prosecution
of it cannot rightfully be prohibited to one who will condcuct the 
business in a proper and circumspect manner. Such an one would be
"deprived of his liberty" without due process of law."
Ibid. Sec. 102.</p>

<p>IT SHOULD REQUIRE NO CONSIDERATION to discover that the set in 
question discriminates against those who lack a college education
and in favor of those who are not so lacking. That the actual 
posession of all the benefits which such an education would confer
is no excuse for the failure to attend such a college. It is not
merit, but the evidence of it which seperates the 'classes'.</p>

<p>Such discrimination is unjust and is in defiance of the constitutional 
rights of the individual</p>

<p>In Raich vs Truax et al. 219 Fed. 273, such an infringment was
relieved against. The state had passed an act forbidding any 
employer of labor to employ les than 80% of qualified electors
in his work. The requirement also extended to native-born citizens
as being the qualified ones to be employed to the extend specified.
Upon injunction being brought to restrain the enforcement
of this act the U.S. District Court, JJ. Morrow, Van Fleet and Sawtelle 
held:</p>

<p>"We think the act in question denies to complainant the equal 
protection of the laws, and is therefore in violation of the 14th
amendment to the Constitution of the U.S., and is void."</p>

<p>Quoting from the decision of the U.S. C.C. of Appeals in Tiburcio
Parrott, the court said; <gap></gap> "In our country, hostile and discriminating
legislation by a state against persons of any class----
in whatever form it may be expressed, is forbidden by the 14th amendment
of the Constitution."</p>

<p>In Re Ah Chong (C.C) 2 Fed. 733.</p>

<p>The underlying principle of discrimination is pointed out by the 
U. S. C. C. A. of Penn. in Fraser vs McConway 82 Fed. 247, where a 
license tax was imposed upon unnaturalized foreign born persons who 
might be employed within the State. The court says:</p>

<p>"The tax is of an unusual character and is directed against and 
confined to a particular class of persons. - - The act is hostile
to and discriminates against such persons. It interposes to the pursuit
by them of their lawful avocations, obstacles to which others
under like circumstances are not subjected. It imposes upon these 
persons burdens which are not lai upon others in the same calling
and condition.</p>

<p>The case of Yick Wo. vs. Hopkins. 116 U.S. 356; 30 L.ed. 220. is 
a text upon the case at bar.</p>

<p>Under an ordinance of the City of San Francisco, chineese laundries
were prevented from obtaining license by the arbitrary authority
conforred upon the Board. The ordinance was held to be void
as conflicting witht he 14th amendment of the Fed. Constitution.
The case as a whole is instructive and is leading authority
upon the question involved here.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>There are many cases wherein the United States Supreme Court has 
maintained the rights of the individual as against unjust disceimination 
under the guise of police regulation. but none perhaps so 
pointed or so recent as the case of</p>

<p>SMITH VS TEXAS "232 U. S. 630; 56 L. ed 1129</p>

<p>The state of Texas passed a law forbidding the employement of 
any person as conductor of a freight train unless he should have 
previously acted as brakeman or freight conductor for two years</p>

<p>One who served several years as an engineer was employed
as such frieght conductor and was arrested therefor under the act in
question. His conviction was sustained by the state courts and 
affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. On error to the U.S.
Supreme Court these convictions were set aside and the act was held void
as an unreasonable infringement upon the right of the indivual.
The briefs of counsel are full and the ciration of causes in 
very great and the decison of the highest importance and closely in
point here.</p>

<p>Justice Lamar in delivering the opinion of the Court said;</p>

<p>None of the cases sustains the propostiotn that under the power
to sustaint he public safety, a privilleged class can be created and 
be then given a monopoly of the right to towrk in a specialo aor favored
position. Such a statute would shut the door without a hearing 
upon many persons and classes of persons who were competent to serve,
and would deprive them of theliberty to work in a calling they
were qualified to fill with safety to the public and benefit to 
themselves. - - - The act prescribes no other qualification for appointment
as conductor than that for two years the applicant should
have been a brakeman of a freight train, but affords no opportunity
to others to prove their fitness. It thus absolutely excludes the 
whole body of the public, including many railroad men, form the 
right to secure employment as conductor on a freight train. For it 
is noted that under the statute, not only the general public, but 
also four classes of railroad men, familiar with the movement
and operations of trains, and having the same kind of experience as a
brakemen, are given no chance to show their competency, but are
arbitrarily denied the right to act as conductors. The statute
excludes firemen and engineers of all trains and all brakemen and 
conductors of passesger trains. But no reason is suggested why a 
brakeman on a passenger trian should be denied the right to serve
in a position that the brakeman of a freight train is permitted to 
fill. Both have the same class of work to do, both acquire the 
same familiarity with rules, signals, and methods of moving and 
distributing cars, and if the training of one qualifies him to serve
as conductor, the like training of the other should not exclude him
from the right to earn his living in the same occupation."----</p>

<p>"So that the case distinctly raises the question as to whether
a statute, in permitting certain competent men to serve, can lay 
down a test which absolutely prohibits other competent men from 
entering the same private employement. it would seem that to ask 
the question is to answer it, -and the answer in no way denies the 
right of the

<pb></pb>                                                                                                                                                                                                     
right of the State to require examinations to test the fitness 
and capacity of brakemen, firemen, engineers and conductors to 
enter upon a service frought with so much of risk to themselves and                                                                                                                 to the public.</p>

<p>But all men are entitled to the equal protectins of the law in
their right to work for the support of themselves and families.
A statue which permits the brakeman to act, because he is presumptively
competent, and prohibits the employment of engineers and others
who can affirmatively prove that they are likewise competent, is
not confined to securing the public safety, but denies to many the 
liberty of contract gratned to brakemen, and operates tonestablish
rules of promotion in a private employment.</p>

<p>"Life, liberty and property, and the equal protection of the law
grouped together in the Constitution, are so related that the deprivation
of any one of those separate and independent rights may 
lessen or extinguish the value of the other three. In so far as 
a man is deprived of the right to labor, his liberty is restriced,
his capacity to earn wages and acquire property is lessened, and
he is denied the protection which the law affords those who are
permitted to work. LIBERTY means more than freedom from servitude,
and the constitutional guaranty is an assureance that the citizen 
shall be protected in the right to use his powers of mind and body
in any lawful calling."</p>

<p>In LAWTON VS STEELE, 152 U.S. 187; 38 L.ed. 388, Justie Brown in
delivering the opinion of the court, said;</p>

<p>"To justify the State in thus interposing its authority in behalf
of the public, it must appear, first, that the interests of 
the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular 
class, require such interferance; and, second, that the means are
reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purspose, and not
unduly oppressive upon individuals. The legislature may not, under
the guise of protecting the public interests, arbitrarily interfere with private business, or impose usual and unnecessary restrictions
upon lawful occupations. In other words, its determination as to what is a proper exercise of its police powers, its determination as
to what is a proper exercise of its police powers, is not final or 
conclusive, but is subjec to the supervison of the Courts."</p>

<p>After citing numerous cases the court continues;</p>

<p>"In all these cases the acts were held to be invalid as involving
an unnecessary invasion of the rights of property and a practical 
inhibition of certain occupations harmless in themselves and which
might be carried on without detriment to the public interest."</p>

<p>The principles for which we contend have been announced time 
and again in the many cases before the Supreme Court of the U.S. 
and almost as often in the highest tribunals of every state.</p>

<p>The exercise of the police power must be necessary and its methods
reasonable in their provisions and must not unnecessarily nor 
arbitrarily interfere with the inherent rights of the citizen. When
they go beyond these limits they are in conflct with the 

<pb></pb>

Constitution and have no validity</p>

<p>It is matter of common knowledge that the dental society of 
the State has long been more influential in its efforts to drive out
competiton in that business and prevent the incoming of dentists
from other states, thus keeping the field for themselves. The law
of 1888 and that of 1893 were both fair and reasonable in their 
provisions and afforded ample protection to the public. The sole
purpose of the act of 1901 was to keep out dentists from other states
and make it impossible for those who had gained their knowlede
and skills by the long, hard road of expereince, and who had been 
unable to take the benefits of a college course, from practicing.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
<p>By this means it was expected to keep out a large class of qualified
practioners and such as been its effect.</p>

<p>There can be no valid reason given why the 80 boys and girls who 
recently graduated from the Pacific Coast Dental College in Portland
should be allowed to stand for examination to practice of wahsington
and such men as the petitoner be excluded from that test. His
skill and experience and his moral character are unquestioned. He 
has devoted his life to the acquirement of that knowledge and skill
in the true channels from which it should be drawn. The right to 
earn his livelihood therby is equal to any mans. He is entitled
to the same consideration as every other person within the 
jurisdiction of the United States and the possessin of a diploma from
some dental collect could add nothing to his qualifications to serve
the public and in no way protects the public health.</p>

<p>The following U.S. Supreme Court decisions will be found in line
with our contention.</p>

<p>Locher vs New York 198 U.S. 52; 49 L. ed. 940
Hennington vs State of Georgia 163 U.S. 300; 41 L. ed 169
Ohio Oil Co. vs Indianna 177 U.S. 185; 44 L. ed. 728-9
Voight vs Wright 141 U.S. 62; 35 L. ed. 649
State of Minn. vs Barber 136 U.S. 313; 34 L. ed. 457-8
Mugler vs Kansas City 123 U.S. 623; L. ed. 211</p>

<p>Itt is sometimes said that the legislature is the exclusive judge
of the conditions to be imposed for the protection of the public
health and safety. But these provisions must, under the constitution,
be reasonable in their nature and not unnecessarily trench

<pb></pb>

upon the rights of the individual.</p>

<p>In the language of Chief Justice Marshall in Marbury vs Madison
1 Cranch 137; 2 L. ed. 60;</p>

<p>"The powers of the legistlature are defined and limited, and 
that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the Constitution
is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose
is that limitation committed to writing if those limits may at any
time be passed by those intented to be restrained? The distinction 
between government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished 
if those limits do not confine the persons on whom they are imposed.
and if acts and acts allowed are of equal oblication.?"</p>

<p>To require the petitioner to expatriate himself and go to some 
other state to study for three years in some dental colelge to learn
exactly what he already knows and has acquired by long years of 
arduous labor and study, is so unreasonable as to appear almost ridiculous</p>

<p>To say that mere residence and pratice at the time of the 
passage of the act of 1901 dispenses with all other qualification 
is equally absurd.</p>

<p>To create a class of college students and provide that no one
else shall have the right to prove by examination his qualifications
of knowledge and skill to practice his life-long profession, seems
so far from the justice and integrity of constitutional liberty as
to need no comment upon its invalidity.</p>

<p>It appears that the petitioner has duly applied for a license
and tendered the required fee and offerred to subject himself to 
the examination by the Board, only to be refused for want of the 
all-important diploma.</p>

<p>That he is fully skilled and qualifited to serve the public in his chosen profession, to a far greated extent than a mere college graduate can be. That he practiced his profession for 9 years
before the objectionable law was passed and ever since. That he is 
of good moral character and a man of family.</p>

<p>Is he not entitled to the protection of the Federal Constitution
or is the Board of Dental Examiners and its parent of the State dental
society supreme and above the Constitution?</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>While there are undoubtedly cases which sustain similar
enactments, they will be only found to be those of state courts and on 
inspection will be discovered to be without reason or authority for 
their support and in no sense binding upond the Federal courts in 
construing the Constitutional question.</p>
