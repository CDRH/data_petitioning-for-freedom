and confinement is this: That the said paper writing is not a

writing had any jurisdiction to commit said Defendant: and that paper
writing is not a commitment, but is void and no affect whatever:
and that said Sheriff has no right or authority to detain said
Petitioner thereon.</p>

is filed herewith as part hereof, and marked "Exhibit A".</p>
