<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN 
DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON NORTHERN 
DIVISION.</p>

<p>IN RE. THE APPLICATION OF 
FRANCIS STEPHEN MEDCRAF
FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.
3038
BRIEF FOR PETITIONER.</p>

<p>MR GEO. D. EMERY, for the Petitioner <del>.</del></p>

<p>THE PETITIONER was charged and conviced before a Justice of the
Peace with the 'crime' of practicing dentistry without a certificate'
contrary to the provisions of the Dental Code of Washington.</p>
<p>Having been committted to prison under this conviction he brings
this proceeding to enquire into the lawfulness of the imprisonment.</p>
<p>He alleges that the statute under which these proceedings were
had and the conviction was entered is void because in conflict with 
the provisions of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U. S.
Constitution, in that he is deprived of his libert and property
without due process of law and that the Act in question den<del>e</del>ys to him
(a person within the jurisdiction of the State) the 'equal protection
of the laws'.</p>
<p>The amendment in question provides,</p>
    <p>"nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or 
    property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person
    within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."</p>
<p>Sec. 1977 of the Comp. Laws of the U. S. guarantees equal rights
under the law to all 'persons' within the jurisdiction of the States
and under the laws of every state. Such 'persons' shall have the 
right "in every state and territory - - to the full and equal benefit 
of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property"</p>
<p>The citizenship of the 'person' is therefore no consequence.</p>
<p>The pledge of 'equal protection of the laws' is a pledge of the 
protection of 'equal' laws. <add>Yien Wo vs. Hopkins 118 U.S. 356</add></p>
<p>THE FIRST DENTAL CODE of Washington is found in Hills Statutes
&amp; Codes of Wash. Sec. 2854 et seq. being the Act of Jany. 1888.</p>
<pb/>
<p>It provides;</p>
    <p>"--it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the 
    practice of dentistry in the state of Washington, unless said 
    person has graduated and received a diploma from the faculty of a 
    dental college charted under the authority of some one of the United
    States or foreign governments, or shall have obtained a certificate
    from <del>some</del> a board of dentists duly authorized and appointed by the
    provisions of this chapter to issue such certificates."</p>
    <p>A board of 5 dentists is provided for to be appointed by 
    the Governor who are to be "practicing dentists" and take an oath
    of office.</p>
    <p>Persons practicing dentistry in the state at the passage of 
    the Act must enroll their names with the Board within 3 months and
    shall thereupon - without examination - receive a certificate as a 
    practitioner of dentistry.</p>
    <p>Any perosn may present to the Board a certificate or diploma
    from any reputable dental college and satisfy the Board of his right
    to the same, and thereupon such person shall be licensed to practice
    dentistry within the state.</p>
    <p>All others desiring to practice dentistry must submit to an 
    examination before the Board and must show the possession of skill in 
    dental surgery 'satisfactory to said Board' , and shall thereupon
    receive such certificate to practice.</p>
<p>IN 1893 this law was amended; The new act provided for</p>
    <p>A slight change in the system of appointments of the Board.</p>
    <p>Examination of those desiring to practice dentistry in the 
    state, prescribing a standard of qualifications and requiring that 
    "no person shall be eligible for such examination unless he or she
    shall be of good moral character and shall present to said board his 
    or her diploma from some dental college in good standing and shall 
    give satisfactory evidence of his or her rightful possession of the 
    same; PROVIDED, That the said Board may admit to examination such 
    other persons of good moral character as shall give satisfactory 
    evidence of having been engaged in the practice of dentistry ten years
    prior to the date of the application for examination."</p>
    <p>All persons authorized to practice under the fomer law and 
    still engaged in practice are to be enrolled and licensed without 
    further examination.</p>
    <p>Students enrolled in a regular dental college and studying 
    in a licensed dentists office in the state are exempted from the
    penal provisions and might practice under their preceptor.</p>
    <p>(N. B. There was then, as now, no 'dental college' in the State
    so the regular attendance thereon required by the act was of no
    value or effect in fact.</p>
<p>IN 1901 this law was materially amended and all its provisions 
inconsistent with the new act were repealed. This act is Chap 152 of 
the Laws of 1901. Section 4 of this act provides;</p>
<p>"Any person or persons seeking to practice dentistry in the State
of Washington, or to own, operate or cause to be operated or run, 
or manage a dental office or place for the practice of dentistry in 
the State of Washington, after the passage of this Act, shall file
his or her name, together with an application for examination, with
<fw>2</fw>
<pb/>
the Secretary of the State Board of Dental Examiners and at the time 
of making such application, shall pay to the Secretary of such Board
a fee of twenty-five dollars and present him or herself at the first
regular meeting thereafter of said Board to under examination 
before that body.</p>
<p>No person shall be eligible for such examination unless he or 
she shall present to said Board his or her diploma from some Dental 
College in good standing and shall give satisfactory evidence of his 
or her rightful possession of the same ; PROVIDED, this section shall 
not apply to persons engaged in the practice of dentistry at the 
time of the passage of this act who are bons fide citizens of the 
State of Washington."</p>

<p>Provision is made for the issue of license or certificate to the
successful applicant and for recording such certificate and the 
practice without such record of dentistry is made penal under fine of 
$50.00 to $200.00 or imprisonment in the County Jail for not more 
than six months.</p>
<p>It appears by the record that the State Board of Dental 
Examiners employed one Conover to go the office of petitioner and secure 
his professional services ot remove two decayed teeth and paid him
therefor. Thereupon Conover - by direction of the Board - filed a 
complaint with the Justice, secured a warrant thereon and the arrest
of petitioner for 'practicing dentistry without having a certificate
of admission to practice recorded with the County Auditor', contrary
to said Act. <add>(State Board prosecuting Core)</add></p>
<p>Upon the trial, petitioner duly raised all the constitutional
questions herepresented by his objections being overruled, the 
evidence was taken. It thereby appeared that the petitioner had served
five years as an apprentice to a competent and reputable dentist in
London, Eng; had continuously thereafter practiced dentistry in the 
employ of competent dentists in England, France and Greece for 8 
years; thereafter continued such practice for himself in London, 
Canada and the United States for 7 years and thereafter in Seattle for 
7 1/2 years, making a continuous practice of 27 1/2 years -including his 
apprent iceship. That he had, before commencing practice in Seattle, 
duly applied to the said Board of Dental Examiners, tendered the fee 
and requested and appeared for examination but such examination was
refused to the ground that the petitioner had no diploma from a dental
college. Whereupon and for that reason a certificate and license 
were refused. His conviction and sentence followed.</p>
<fw>3</fw>
<pb/>
<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE POWER OF POLICE REGULATION of the practice of DENTISTRY by the 
State being conceded, it is contended by the Petitioner that this 
Act far transcends the powers of the State in that particular.</p>
<p>It is unreasonable in its provisions; an unnecessary and improper 
restrictino of and infringment upon the rights of the individual to 
practice his profession for his livelihood; unnecessarily deprives
him of property and restrains his liberty, contrary to the constitutional
provision referred to; and constitutes unlawful discrimination, 
and is therefore VOID.</p>

    <p>"In the exercise of the police power in the regulation of 
    business, the legislature may not arbitrarily impose any vexatious 
    burdens upon the pursuit of any of these avocations."</p>
        <p>People vs Steele 14 L.R.E. (NS) 368.</p>
        <p>Kan. City Gas Co. vs Kan. City 198 Fed. 500</p>
        <p>Harmon vs State 66 Oh. St. Rep. 254</p>
    <p>"The public power to regulate railroads and the private right 
    of ownership of such property co-exist; they do not destroy each one
    the other; and where the power to regulate is so arbitrarily 
    exercised as to infringe upon the rights of ownership, the exertion is 
    void because it is repugnant to the due process and equal protection 
    clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>
        <p>Atlantic Coast Line RR. vs North Car. 206 U.S. 1</p>
    <p>"There is no easier nor more tempting opportunity for the 
    practice of tyranny than in the police control of occupations. Good and
    bad motives often combine to accomplish this kind of tyranny. The 
    zeal of the reformer as well as <del>the</del> cupidity and self interest must
    alike be guarded against. Both are apt to prompt the employment of 
    means to attain an end desired, which the constitution prohibits."</p>
    <p>- - "if the business is not inherently harmful, the prosecution 
    of it cannot rightfully be prohibited to one who will conduct it in 
    a proper and circumspect manner. Such an one would be 'deprived of 
    his liberty without due process of law'."</p>
        <p>Tiedman on Police Powers Sec. 102.</p>
    <p>"Any prohibition which extends further than to prevent the 
    admission of incompetent men, will be unconstitutional."</p>
        <p>Ib. Sec. 87</p>
    <p>"If under the guise of the police power, the legislature 
    unreasonably and capriciously restrains one's liberty or property, the
    Court may interpose the Constitution and declare the law void."</p>
        <p>State vs Smith 33 L. R. A. (NS) 187. (Mo.)</p>
    <p>"A law which unnecessarily and oppressively restrains a citizen
    from engaging in any trafic or disposing of his property as he may
    see fit, though passed under the specious pretext of a preservative
    of the health of the inhabitants, would be void."</p>
        <p>State vs Fisher 52 Mo. 174.</p>
<p>The right to practice one's profession is 'property' of which he may 
not be unnecessarily or arbitrarily deprived.</p>
<fw>4</fw>
<pb/>
        <p>State vs. Sachs 2 Wash 373</p>
<p>The practice of the profession of Dental Surgery of Dentistry is 
a profitable employment, an honorable profession and an important 
one both to the petitioner and to the public. The sole element 
of danger and the sole point at which the police power approaches it 
is in the admission to practice incompetent persons. The health
of the public demands that due precautions be exercised by the state
in admitting to practice dentistry only those who are qualified and 
possess good moral character and the requisite technical skill.</p>
<p>Beyond this the State has no right or power to go. In prescribing
the standard of qualification it must look to the true purpose which 
it is authorized to conserve. It may not, under the pretext of a 
police regulation, create and protect a select and favored class, to 
the exclusion of others equally well qualified to practice the
profession. Wherein does a diploma entitle a man to undergo an 
examination to test his fitness, any more than long years of active and
arduous practice and practical experience under qualified tutors?</p>
<p>Why may the boy or girl fresh from the halls of some Dental 
college, be admitted to display his or her qualifications by examination
while the actual practitioner of 27 years standing, of wide and 
valuable actual practice and experience, is debarred therefrom?</p>
<p>Is such a requirement 'reasonably necessary' to the health of the
inhabitants? Or is it not rather valuable in that it will restrict 
the number of practitioners that may come in from other states to the
possible detriment of the present local practitioners?</p>
<p>It is said that the legislature is the best judge of the necessity 
for the exercise of the police power and the means of accomplishing
that exercise. This may possess some merit but it must not be
carried too far. The moment that the legislature transcends the limit
of 'reasonable and necessary requirement' it comes in conflict
with the Constitutional provision and must fall.</p>
<p>In Eastman vs State 10 N.E. 97 cited by the respondent here, the 
supreme court of Indiana announced the strange doctrine that the 
question of whether the act was reasonable or not was a legislative
<fw>5</fw>
<pb/>
and not a judicial question. Strange assumption. If this were
true, how could the courts ever determine a law to be unconstitutional</p>
<p>The legislature having adopted it, must be presumed to have found
it necessary <add>and reasonable</add>, therefore it is constitutional!</p>
<p>Again and again the Supreme Court of the United States has 
contradicted this doctrine and held that the reasonableness of the law 
and its necessity are for the Court to pass upon and if found 
unreasonable and unnecessary as an exercise of the police power, <del>they are</del> <add>it is</add>
void.</p>
<p>in LAWTON VS STEELE 152 U. S. <del>187</del> <add>133</add> Justice Brown speaking for that
Court said;</p>
    <p>"To justify the state in thus interposing its authority in behalf 
    of the public, it must appear, first, that the interests of the public
    generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, 
    require such interferance; and, second, that the means are reasonably 
    necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose and not unduly oppressive
    upon individuals; The legislature may not, under the guise of 
    protecting the public interests, arbitrarily interfere with private 
    business, or impose unusual and unnecessarily restrictions upon lawful
    occupations. In other words, its determination at to what is a proper
    exercise of its police powers is not final or conclusive, but is 
    subject to the supervision of the Courts." After citing numerous case
    the court continues;</p>
    <p>"In all these cases the acts were held to be invalid as involving 
    an unnessary invasion of the rights of property adn a practical 
    inhibition of certain occupations, harmless in themselves, and which 
    might be carried on without detriment to the public interest."</p>
        <p>Sanitary Dist. vs. C. &amp; A.R.Co. 108 N.E. 314</p>
    <p>The exercise of the police power must be necessary and its
    methods reasonable in their provisions and must not unnecessarily nor 
    arbitrarily interfere with the inherent rights of the citizen. When
    they go beyond these limits, the are in conflict with the Constitution
    and have no validity.</p>
        <p>State vs Florida E.C. RR. 67 So. 911</p>
        <p>Atlantic C.Line RR vs North Car. 206 U.S. 1</p>
<p>THE OBJECT OF TEH LAW is the protection of the health of the 
inhabitants. To that end, the qualifications of those who assume to 
practice dentistry are material and of importance. Reasonable tests and
regulations to secure the end are lawful and if such interefere with 
the right of the individual to practice, they are still valid. But 
when they go beyond the line of reason or necessity and are no longer
regulative of the practice of the profession but unduly restrict that 
right in a qualified individual, they are prohibited by the Federal 
Constitution.</p>
<fw>6</fw>
<pb/>
<p>7</p>
<p>Every citizen has a right to engage in any lawful pursuit.
This is a natural right. The practice of Dentistery could not lawfully
be prohibited by the State nor could it be materially hampered
without great inconvenience and injury to the public. Like the 
practice of law or medicine it is essential to the health and well
being of the people. When the State has taken reasonable and proper
measures to protect the people from imposition and want of skill on
the part of its practitioners, it has fulfilled its duty and exhausted 
its power. It is fitting that practitioners be required to 
possess good moral character and to be skilled in their profession.
Such skill may be attained, in a perfunctory way, by a course in a 
dental college, but without practical experience, the graduate is 
not thoroughly competent to practice. He is only beginning his 
experience. It is idle to compare the skill of a youthful graduate 
just from his college with the ripened experience of the practitioner
of 27 years actual practice of his profession. Why should the one 
be admitted to the test of an examination as to fitness and not the 
other ?</p>
<p>At common law the field of dental practice was open to all. The 
practitioner was held liable in damages for any act or neglect not 
justified by his profession. A system of apprenticeship was 
recognized and became an established custom. This of course was long
before any Dental College was founded. The custom grew into a law
and the greatest dental practictioners of modern times obtained their 
first professional schooling through the apprenticeship to some
dentist. The custom still prevails in almost every state and is 
recognized in our own.There is not and never was a dental college
in this State. How then can an apprentice or student be enrolled
in and attend lectures in such a college and at the same time gain
anything of knowledge from a dental preceptor in this state?</p>
<p>Such a provision of law is meaningless in view of the conditions.</p>
<p>In almost every state there exists an association of dentists
under various names, constituting a state dental society. This 
ystem of societies is bound together by a National organization.</p>
<p>In pursuit of its own purposes, this society has framed and 
pressed to enactment the laws governing the practice of dentistry 7 
<pb/>
in many of the states, notably in New York, Minneota, Michigan,
Wisconsin, the Carolinas, North Dakota, Oregon, California, and 
Washington.</p>
<p>In the states where such society has secured legislation, the 
requirement of a diploma is made a pre-requisite to an examinatino,
always expecting those in actual practice when such acts were passed</p>
<p>In some of these states the Courts have been led into sustaining
such laws though it is apparent from examination of the decisions
that the c onstitutional question has rarely been raised and
never upon such a state of facts as here exists. Little authority 
is cited to sustain such decisions. The reasons given in support of 
them are unsatisfactory and in many cases the question decided is 
entirely obiter dictum.</p>
<p>An examination of the statutes of all the states shows;
19 states provide for diploma as pre-requisite to examination.</p>
    <p>Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa,
    Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New
    York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 
    Wisconsin, Washington, and Wyoming.</p>
<p>17 states require either a diploma or an examination</p>    
    <p>Arkansas, Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois,
    Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Montana, 
    Nevada, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, South Dakota and Utah.</p>
<p>30 prescribe a standard of qualification in specified branches
of learning.</p>
<p>18 require an examination "satisfactory to the Board"</p>
<p>A majority of the states providing for both diploma and examination
make some provision whereby the Board of Examiners must consist of 
members of the State Dental Society.</p>
<p>The same states provide, generally, for the admission without 
examination upon the certificates of Dental Boards of such states
as admit their practitioners on like certificates - in other words
a reciprocal law.</p>
<p>The New York law is noticable as an example of the influence of 
this Society. <add>The applicant must have passed 4 years in
a High School and be a graduate of such</add>
school or its equivalent or must have received as a graduate a dental
degree or have pursued a course of dental study and hold a degree
from some dental college or Foerign Country or must have practiced 8
<pb/>
dentistry for 25 years in some state other than New York.
The State Dental Society is directly recognized and the Board appointed
from its members.</p>
<p>These conditions give much force to the suggestion that the 
laws in question are framed with the design to protect the Dental
Society from competition rather than the public. They rank with
the legislation influenced and secured by Manufacturers, Plumbers,
and dealers generally which ostensibly protect the public yet in 
truth serve more perfectly to foster monoplies and combinations.</p>
<p>It would be perfectly easy to enact laws that would really 
protect the inhabitants from quacks and unskillful practitioners and 
at the same time give to honest and competent dentists the right to 
live and practice their vocation.</p>
