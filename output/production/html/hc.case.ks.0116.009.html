because they were then under arrest. Wiley did not say they should not go out. Captain Christian advised them not to give bail Wiley then said "then they will have to go to jail," Wiley may have been a little excited but he was no more excited than Captain Christian. Wiley did not say to me "then Mr. Marshall I insist upon their going to jail" I stood within five feet of them and heard all that was said. I took them to jail by order of Commission Montgomery.

I took the plaintiff to jail about 5 or 6 o'clock PM of the 23d of November AD 1868 and took him from the jail about 9 or 10 O'clock AM on the 24th of November 1868. I did not put my hand on plaintiff nor did any person in my presence. I used him as kindly as I knew now and I saw nothing
