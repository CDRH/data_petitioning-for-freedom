    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Oscar Clark petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve his ward, Edith Uhling, from the custody of Cassius Uhling and John Doe, which was granted. Edith was described as "incompetent," and Oscar worried that she was being deprived of liberty by her son, Cassius and Sheriff Anderson of Phelps County. They had apparently taken her from a sanitarium in College View. At the hearing, Clark withdrew his petition. She was later placed in the state hospital for the insane in Hastings.</li>
