a pretended charge of murder in the
first degree.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">4th That said restraint is illegal in 
this 1st That the pretended
preliminary examination of your 
petitioner before J.W. Carpenter
a Justice of the Peace in Lincoln County
Wash. Ter. was little better than a
farce being conducted and controlled
by one J. H. Friedlander a Deputy 
Sheriff who to all intents and
purposes performed the duties of
Justice of the Peace, Prosecuting Attorney
and Deputy Sheriff.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">2nd That no charge of murder was

      <p class="tei_p">3rd That said Justice neglected to
fix any bail for your petitioner or to 
make any order affirmation or negotiate 
in relation thereto.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">4th That your petitioner has not been
committed for any alleged crime
and is now held unlawfully by 
the said John Cody Sheriff upon 
a pretended committment from
said Carpenter which does not
any where state or allege for what 
crime your petitioner is held.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">5th That your petitioner is wounded
and in such physical condition

<span class="hr"> </span>


that close confinement in jail
would be inhumane and dangerous
to his health.</p>

6th That your petitioner is ready and 
willing to give any reasonable bail
for his appearance at such
time and place and before 
such tribunal as your Honor
