    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Rachael (Ray) Cohen claims to have married Albert Rosenbloom (petitioner) on 7 April 1908 in Russia. Rosenbloom stated that he was pressured by force and threat by &#x201C;matrimonial agents&#x201D; to consent to marriage. The marriage was completed according to the Jewish rights and customs of the area and was in violation of Russian law. The petition stated that the marriage had no legally binding force and was never consummated. He paid Cohen 400 rubles soon after the ceremony and then left Russia for America. While he lived in America from that point forward, he remained a citizen of Russia. On 20 February 1910, Cohen followed Rosenbloom and filed petitions which led to his arrest in New York. He was compelled by reason of the arrest and imprisonment to pay Cohen $5/week in support. Cohen continuously harassed and annoyed Rosenbloom in his place of work, so much so that he decided to stop paying her support, left New York, and became a resident of Missouri. On 11 November 1911, Rosenbloom moved to Douglas County. On 9 December 1912, Cohen filed a complaint against Rosenbloom at the solicitation of the Jewish Society in Omaha. In the petition, she claimed to be Rosenbloom&#x2019;s wife and used the name &#x201C;Rachael Rosenbloom.&#x201D; She claimed that Albert had neglected his duties to her beginning on 1 March 1911. A warrant was issued for his arrest in Douglas County, he was taken into custody and placed in jail. On 16 December 1912, Albert Rosenbloom was sentenced to 90 days in county jail. This petition asked for a writ of habeas corpus to be issued to release him from his unlawful imprisonment, it hinged on the claim that Nebraska had no jurisdiction over the affairs of Rachael Cohen and Albert Rosenbloom as they were both Russian citizens and were residing in New York at the date listed in the complaint. Judge Leslie allowed the writ on 16 December 1912. The Appearance Docket for the case notes that the application was denied on 18 December 1912, there is no reason stated.</li>
