    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Andrew Anderson was arrested by Hudson, a policeman of Spokane, Washington, from the order of the sheriff of Spokane, charging Anderson with being a fugitive from justice of the state of Washington. He was imprisoned without any complaint for said offense or warrant being issued from Omaha. He made a petition alleging he was unlawfully deprived for vagrancy charges. It was found that the vagrancy charges were not issued in good faith but were made to subterfuge to aid the requisition from Washington. He was released and then arrested again in the courthouse corridor upon a complaint ordered by the judge of the Omaha police court for having opposed and resisted a police officer in May. C. R. Scott decided that the warrant of commitment was contrary to the state's law and was illegal. The judge, Scott, decided that Anderson was unlawfully deprived of his liberty, so Anderson was released from custody.
