    <li>Summary of Proceedings: William B. Ten Eyck filed a complaint on 5 October 1896 that Jim Smith committed the offense of &#x201C;Drunk &amp; Disorderly&#x201D; the prior day (4 October 1896). He was sentenced by Police Judge Gordon to 30 days in County Jail and to pay the $2.00 Cost and $1.00 Mittimus. The same day, William Harrington filed a complaint stating that Mr. Smith had committed the crime of Larceny on 22 September 1896. For this charge, Police Judge Gordon sentenced him to 30 days in County Jail along with a $2.50 Cost and $1.00 Mittimus. He plead &#x201C;not guilty&#x201D; to both counts.
Pas O. Hawes, the Attorney for Petitioner, submitted an application for a writ of Habeas Corpus stating that Jim Smith was unlawfully deprived of his liberty, having served both of his sentences yet still being held in the County Jail. On 9 November 1896, Judge Baker ordered that the writ be allowed. A subpoena was sent on 9 November 1896 ordering Pete Schenk (witness) to appear in court on 10 November 1896, bringing all records pertaining to Jim Smith&#x2019;s case. 
On 9 June 1898, Judge Baker signed an order re-taxing the costs of the proceeding to the County.</li>
