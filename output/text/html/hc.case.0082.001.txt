by the Mayor thereof on the 7th day of January 1887 by one G.A. Hill Justice of the
Peace of said City on the 1 day of Feb 1887.

the ordinances of said City in that the said Section one of said Ordinance under which
your petitioner was tried and sentenced provides that any one guilty of the crime
of assault shall be punished by a fine of not less than five dollars nor more than

found guilty on said pretended charge of assault contrary to said ordinance

Wherefore your petitioner pray that the writ of Habeas Corpus issue him. that the
cause of his said restraint be enquired into and upon such hearing he be discharged
