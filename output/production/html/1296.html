    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In February 1916, Max Selicow filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus on the basis that he was unlawfully restrained of his liberty by Henry W. Dunn, the Chief of Police in Omaha. The petitioner owned a "moving picture theater" and was arrested for disobeying the Health Commissioner's order mandating no children under the age of 12 gain entry to such establishments. The petitioner alleged he had no notice of the order, and any such order is unconstitutional and void as it deprives him of equal protection of the laws. Judge Day allowed the petition. The petitioner gave bail for his appearance, then voluntarily withdrew the bail and surrendered himself to the police. The District Court ruled against the defendant, and the petitioner motioned for a new trial on the grounds the ruling was contrary to law and not supported by sufficient evidence. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Nebraska, the court affirmed the ruling against the plaintiff. </li>
