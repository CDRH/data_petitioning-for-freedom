    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On November 1, 1920, Harry Becker, also known as Isic Feurht, was charged with the crime of "Investigation" and imprisoned in the Omaha City Jail. While there, no other charge was made against him. On November 4, 1920, aided by his attorneys from the firm of Jamieson and O'Sullivan, Becker petitioned for a writ of habeus corpus against chief of police Marshall Eberstein. He pointed out that "investigation" was not a crime in the state of Nebraska, and that he was being unlawfully held.  The case was dismissed upon the relator's motion at his costs on November 4, 1920, and a writ and return was filed on November 6, 1920.</li>
