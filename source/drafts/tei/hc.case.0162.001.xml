were with deceased. Have seen this 
man drunk before  He was accustomed 
to getting drunk when when he could 
obtain Liquuor He was a harmless Man 
when drunk or sober when I knew

Manner if they did not know him 
that he was a bad Man although 
he was harmeless He had a pillow 
under his head when I saw him I think
when I got there they where putting a pillow
under his head, did not notice

the Halll when pillow was put under his 
head when pillow was put under his 
head that he was laying acrass the
