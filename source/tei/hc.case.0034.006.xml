<p>Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Negro brought into court</p>
<p>Paige appears for petitioner</p>

<p>GW Sparahawk Senr sworn 
for prisoner - examines the Negro - 
and says he has known him about 
19 years - I think he could not have 
been more than 5 years - when I first 
knew him - he was then living in the 
family of Wm L Burk in this city - 
knew the Negro's mother - she passed 
for a free woman - many years - 
before the petitioner was born - 
cross exn I am certain I have known 
for 19 years - I never been absent more 
than 6 mos at a time - he has always 
passed as free</p>

<p>Captn Burke sworn - I have 
lived in St Louis more than 
50 years - examines the negro -
and says in 1839 Spring that Negro's 
mother - who was always deemed free,
wished me to take the boy and raise 
him - boy was then about 4 years 
old - I am sure it is same negro 
boy - I raised him up to about 2 
years ago - I then shipped him on a

<pb/>
boat to go to Osage River - up 
the River he and the captn of the 
boat quarrelled &amp; he quit &amp; started 
back to St Louis on the road home 
he was taken up <del/> I think about
2 years ago - and lodged in jail as 
a runaway slave - I did not 
interfere and he was sold for his 
expenses until he should become 
21 years old - I dont know how 
many times he has been sold since 
1st to Lynch next to Thompson 
then to Shibley - I think these men 
all knew the boy was not a slave 
for life - Thompson &amp; Shibley knew 
it any how - Thompson <del>sold</del> bought 
him from Lynch for $100 &amp; sold him 
to Shibly as I am informed for $100 - 
I am certain Shibley knew the boys 
time was out for I told him so - 
he however claimed the boy owed him 
$120 after his time was out - that 
John - Negro never paid him anything 
and would not give him up 
until this sum was paid - 
Shipbley sold him again to a man 
by the name of Denney - I think and 
he took him to Memphis &amp; sold him 
as a slave for life - he was to


<pb/>
serve until he arrived to the age of 
21 - he is now about 23 years 
and his time of service is out - 
The boys mother sold me his time 
until he should arrive at the age 
of 21 years - I know the Boys mother 
lives here in St Louis and has always lived here - since <del/> boys 
birth - always regarded as free 
never claimed by any person to be 
a slave - he was sold as a runaway 
- but it was known to jailor and to the purchaser as a free boy - and not a slave 
for life</p>

<p>Francis W Burke sworn-</p>

<p>I am son of the witness who has 
just been examined - About 19 years 
ago my mother brought the negro 
to our house - I have known the boy 
ever since as a free boy after he should 
become 21 years <del>All that</del> I have 
lived in my fathers house here in St 
Louis ever since and all that he has 
stated in relation to the negro boy being 
in our family - is correct to my knowledge - I know he was put up here 
to be sold so to pay expenses - I told sheriff 
before and at the sale that the boy

<fw>(4)</fw>

was free <unclear>-m</unclear> I know he is more 
than 21 yeas of age - have heard 
his mother admit to mine that the 
boy was to serve in our family 
until he became 21 years-</p>

<p>JA Denney sworn contra</p>

<p>I brought the boy from 
Captn Shipley - who said he thought 
the boy would be free at 21 years - I asked 
him how old he was - and said he had 
2 10 mos to <unclear>him</unclear> yet - he brought the 
boy to Lynch's yard and I bought him - 
he transferring to me the Shff's 
Title  - I took him to Memphis Tenn 
and sold him in the same way 
that I bought him - with the sheriff 
Title - I sold to Wm Wyatt about 3 or 
4 weeks ago - for $300 - 
He was sold by sheriff as a runaway slave - 
and as a boy of 16 years old - I sold as

him as sheriff's sale a little more 
than 2 years ago - I bought him at 
$100 - I sold him probably for $150- </p>

<pb/>
<fw>5h page</fw>
<p>I bought him as a slave for life if 
I chose to keep him as such - no conditions as to the time he was to serve contained 
in the Bill of Sale</p>

<p>The court adjudges that Petitioner 
<del>be discharged</del> is illegally restrained 
of his freedom and entitled to be discharged -</p>
