    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Sakaguchi immigrated to the U.S. from Japan to visit her husband, a resident of the U.S. for twenty-two years at the time. She was denied upon landing for contracting hookworm, and after she was treated, she was further refused admission for an accusation of becoming a public charge, that her passport was not in order, and trouble between her and her husband. Sakaguchi petitioned on the account that the accusations were false and she was refused a fair and impartial trial.
Writ was denied and proceedings were dismissed, so Sakaguchi appealed to proceed to federal circuit court. The initial order was reversed and Sakaguchi was discharged from custody.</li>
