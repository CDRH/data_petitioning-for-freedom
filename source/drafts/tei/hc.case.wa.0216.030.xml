<p>United States District Court
Western Division of Washington
Northern Division</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application 
of Ching Hing for a Writ of Habeas
Corpus } No. <del>2875.</del> 2857
Answer to Petition</p>
<p>Comes now John J. Sullivan, attorney for the Petitioner,
Ching Hing, in answer to the petition of G.P. Fishburne, Assistant
United States Attorney for the Western District of Washington, and
states, alleges and answers as follows:</p>
<p>That the matter therein set up by said G.P. Fishburne,
is outside the record and can not be reviewed or taken connisance of
by this Court, for the reason that if said Secretary of Labor did
review the record and affirm the decision of the Commissioner of Immigration,
in relation to the above entitled case on November 13, 1914,
that the same was done while this Court had jurisdiction of the subject
matter and of the petitioner herein and after a rule to show
cause had served upon Lewis F. Post, Assistant Secretary of Labor
under seal of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, Honorable
Ashley M. Gould, Justice, to show cause why he should not be directed
to make full and direct response to interrogrations propounded under a
stipulation issued by Honorable Jeremiah Neterer, Judge of this Court,
authorizing Thomas G. Lewis, Commissioner, to take said depositions;
and in further answer, Ching Hing, through his attorney, respectfully
informs the Court that no opportunity was given Counsel informing him
when said alleged hearing was had, or that he he be given permission to
appear before Honorable Secretary and present argument in behalf of
sadi alien and petitioner, Ching Hing; and that the said action of the
Secretary, if there was such an action, was arbitrary and contrary to
Law and oversteps the due procedute of this Court.</p>
<p>Wherefore, Ching Hing, through his attorney, John J.
Sullivan, respectfully prays that the petition of G.P. Fishburne,
Assistant United States Attorney, be denied, and this Court procede to
<pb/>
hear the Writ upon its merits, after the determination of the Supreme
Court in and for the District of Columbia, on the question now pending
before Honorable Justice Ashley M. Gould.</p>
