<head>JAMES HAMILTON LEWIS</head>
<p>The sudden passing of Senator James Hamilton Lewis brought regret, and a deep sense of sorrow as well, to those who knew him well during his residence in Seattle four decades ago. Senator Lewis is described by the press of today as being the most colorful member of Congress, stressing, no doubt, that his sartorial impeccability may have been largely accountable for his rise to fame. Mr. Lewis, who served that state of Illinois for an extended period of years in the senate of the United States, had something mroe than fine raiment, a Virginia background, a studied and skilled diplomacy and an oratorical appeal. He soon became a leader whose advice and assistance merited the recognition of his colleagues, who in time, became warmly attached to him, and at his death were profoundly depressed at their loss.</p>
<p>The intense strain to which the members of Congress have of late years been subjected, has taken a heavy death toll of those above the age of 65. Many have fallen under the pressure of a heart attack. Senator Lewis was able to withstand this trying or deal until he had reached a ripe old age. Probably his uniform civility and courtesy had much to do with his longevity. Anyway, he lived long enough and rose high enough to accomplish much that he planned at the very outset to do, even if the methods seemed to be somewhat bizarre. Senator Lewis' serenity was unshaken by criticism, ridicule or even ribaldry, in those early days when his political adversaries sneeringly referred to him as a dandy, or worse still, as a "dude." But, unscathed, he took little notice of what was said of him in the newspapers or on the stump, as long as it was said loud enough for all to hear.</p>
