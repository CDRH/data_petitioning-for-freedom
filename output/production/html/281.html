    <li>Summary of Proceedings: John O. Lee claimed that David Koch was unlawfully deprived of his liberty by Felix J. McShane. Koch was charged with being a fugitive from justice after he escaped Iowa State Hospital for the Insane and traveled to Nebraska. It was ordered that he be extradited back to Iowa and placed back in the care of the hospital. Lee claimed that Koch was of sound mind and placed in the institution under insufficient evidence. The writ was denied by the judge and he remained in custody. Koch then filed an appeal for a new trial for his case to be looked at by the Nebraska Supreme Court. However, it is unknown what the fate of the bound party was after the appeal. </li>
