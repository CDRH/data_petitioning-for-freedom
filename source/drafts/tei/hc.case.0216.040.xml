<p>(1) I am the Assistant Secretary of Labor. I am qualified on the 9th of
June, 1913.</p>
<p>(2) That question relates to the internal administration of the

<p>(4) Same response as to Question 2</p>

<p>(7)Same response as to Question 2.</p>
<p>(8)Same response as to Question 2.</p>
<p>(9) In so far as that applies to immigration cases the response is the

<p>(11)Same response as to Question 2.</p>
<p>(12)Same response as to Question 2.</p>

<p>Monday, November 16, 1914: Adjourned to Monday, November 23rd, 1914,
at 3 pm, pending determination of a certifiateto the Supreme Court

<p>Friday, November 27, 1914: Adjourned to Friday, December 4, 1914, at 3:30pm
Thomas G Lewis
Comissioner.</p>
<p>Personally appeared before me, Thomas G. Lewis, Notary Public
and Commissioner, pursuant to notice, Corry M. Stadden, who being produced
as witness to lawful age for and on behalfof the Petitioner,
Ching Hing, and being first duly sworn according to law, upon Interrogatories
and Cross Interrogatories, did depose and say as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Corry M. Stadden, attorney at law.</p>
<p>(2) Yes.</p>
<p>(3) I did.</p>
<p>(4) Louis F. Post, Assistant Secretary of Labor was present and on
duty in the Department of Labor on September 24th, 25th, and 26th,
1914. I am not certain whether Secretary Wilson was on duty on 
those dates or not, as I was more particular in satisfying myself
that Assistant Secretary Post was on duty, particularly on September 26th.</p>
<p>(5) I was notified on September 26th that Mr. J. B. Sensmore, as "Acting
Secretary" of Labor had affirmed the decision to deport Ching
Hing. The record will show.</p>
<p>(6) Assistant Secretary Post was on duty September 26. I visited
his office to satisfy myself that he was there on that date.</p>
<p>(7) Judge M. T. Dooling, in the U.S. District Court, sitting at San
Franciso, In re Quan Wy Chung, No. 15687, has so held.</p>
<p>(8) Quoting from a certified copy of the opinion In re Quan Wy
Chung, Judge Dooling said in part as follows:
"Whoever, therefore, challenges his right to act must
assume the burden of proving clearly, that his action was
not had in the 'Absence of the Secretary and Assistant Secretary'.
But however inconvenient it may be, if the Secretary
and Assistant are not absent, and particularly if both
are present, his performance of the duties of the Secretary
is unauthorized, either by the Statute, or the order of the
President. In the case at barit is practically conceded, and
conclusively established, that the appeal was not determined 
by the Acting Secretary in the absence of the Secretary and
<pb/>

Assistant Secretary, but that, on the contrary both were
present, and performing the duties of their office at the 
time the appeal was determined. The appellant were by law
to have their appeal heard and determined by him except as
above stated, and the determination of their appeal by another
not authorized, is neither a fair hearing, nor due 
process of law".</p>
<p>this opinion was filed by Judge Dooling with the Clerk of
his Court, October 23rd, 1914, as appears on the certified copy.</p>

<p>Answersof Mr. Stadden to Cross Interrogatories:</p>
<p>(1) I was not.But I satisfied myself that Assistant Secretary
Post was not considering the Ching Hing appeal, though on duty
in the Department.</p>
<p>(2) By seeing the word "approved" or "affirmed" and the initials
of Mr. Densmore, "J.B.D." on the memorandum prepared in the Bureau
of Immigration which recommended exclusion. I also knew personally
that Mr. Densmore was assuming to act upon this case as "Acting Secretary"
regardless of the fact that Assistant Secretary Post was 
on duty at that time.</p>
<p>Corry M. Stadden</p>
<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me,
Thomas G Lewis
Notary Public, D.C. and 
Commissioner.</p>

<p>Adjourned until further notice pending the order of the Court (Mr.
Justice Gould) upon the Rule to Show Cause, issued against the
witness, Louis F. Post, herein.
Thomas G Lewis
Commissioner.</p>

<p>June 10th, 1915: Further proceedings under this Commission hereby
suspended upon advice of Corry M. Stadden, cousel for Ching Hing
that he is informedthat the Petition of Habeas Corpus herein
has been dismissed. The Order of Mr. Justice Gould, of the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia, commanding the witness Louis F.
Post to appear and answer question, was signed this day and a true
copy is appended hereto.
