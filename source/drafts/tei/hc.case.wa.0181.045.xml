<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE UNLAWFUL
DETENTION OF MOOLA SINGH
AND SEVENTY-TWO HINDOO ALIENS</p>
<p>No. 2532.
PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>
<p>Come now the petitioners and request the Court
to grant a rehearing and further, to stay the deporta-
tion of the aliens and the signing of the final judg-
ment until the petitioners have had an opportunity to be
heard.</p>
<p>In the advance sheets for this year the latest
word on the subject has been said by the Supreme Court
of the United States in the advance sheets for January,
1913, No. 3, the case of Zakonaite vs. Wolf, decided in
December of 1912, in which the contention of the petition-
ers is apparently sustained in that the Court states in
that opinion that the facts must be adequate to support
the secretary's conclusions, which shows clearly that
there was no finality as has been contended. Also in a
case decided in June 1912, the supreme Court of the United
States lays dovn a different doctrine to that advanced
by the Government and different to that supporting the
<pb></pb>
ruling of the Honorable Court. These, with other late
cases, it is the desire of attorney for petitioners, to
call to the attention of this Honorable Court.</p>
<p>It will be noted from the attached clipping,
<figure><p>SEATTLE COURT RULING AFFECTS MANY HINDUS</p>
<p>Orientals in San Francisco Will BE Deported
Under Decision Made by 
Federal Judge in This City.</p><p>WASHINGTON, Friday, Sept. 12-
Hindues seeking admission to the United 
States through the Philippines, or any
other American possession, will not
be permitted to land, unless they pass
the examination required under the immigration laws.</p>
<p>Commissioner General of Immigration
Caminetti received word last night
from the immigration commissioner at
Seattle that the federal court there
had sustained his order deporting seventy-
three Hindus who recently arrived
from the Philippines. The 
commissioner ordered them deported "on
the ground that they were unlawfully
within the United States because at
the time of their entry to the Philippines
they were likely to become public
charges if they should come to the
mainland of the United States."</p>
<p>Twenty or more similar cases are
pending at San Francisco and the
Hindus probably will be ordered 
deported under the decision of the court.</p></figure>
<unclear></unclear>there are aliens in other portions of our country,
<unclear></unclear>lestinies are being determined by the decision of
<unclear></unclear>onorable Court and therefore, as this is the first
<unclear></unclear>case of this sort has been before the Federal 
<unclear></unclear>every precaution should be taken to have no
<unclear></unclear>committed and to have every opportunity given
<unclear></unclear>eys for petitioners and the government.</p>
<p>It will be further noted that the cases cited
<unclear></unclear> government and also by this Honorable Court, that in
each case it was either admitted by the aline or was
definitely proven that they were actual law violators,
which is not the case in issue here.</p>
<p>This petition is based on the fact that the
matter of finality of the decision of the immigration
department was but lightly touched upon in the hearing
on the application for the writ, owing to the size
of the record and the number of different phases of the
case, and further for the reason that the petitoners
believe that there is a distinction in the present case
from those cited by the Honorable Judge of the District
Court in his opinion, which the petitioners desire to call
the court's attention to. Further, petitioners believe 
that there are later decisions which would be taken as
authoritive by this Honorable Court than those cited by
<pb></pb>
counsel for the government, and further, certain matters
have been suggested by the opinion of this Honorable
Court.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE petitioners pray that they may be
given leave to present these matters to the Honorable
District Court before judgement is finally signed.</p>

Attorney for Petitioners.</p>
