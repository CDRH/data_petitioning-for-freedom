    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Marguerite Volker (also referred to as Margaret Walker) petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on October 30th, 1924. She claimed that she was being unlawfully detained in jail by M. L. Endres, Sheriff of Douglas County. She claimed that she was being held without just cause, she had no proper trial, no charges upon her, and that she had not been given a fair trial. The judge granted her petition. When M. L. Endres responded to her petition, he claimed that he was holding Marguerite by virtue of a mittimus from F. M. Dineen (Municipal Judge of the City of Omaha). Dineen requested that Marguerite be detained at the County Jail. At the Municipal Court, she had been found guilty on charges of vagrancy and prostitution. Endres insisted that because of this, the writ be denied. The case file included no additional information about this case, but the appearance docket noted that on January 25th, 1927 the writ was dismissed for want of prosecution. The fate of Marguerite is unknown.</li>
