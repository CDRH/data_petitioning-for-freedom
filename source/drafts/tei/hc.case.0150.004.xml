"A pistol shot was heard in the direction
of the Bay Window house Friday night about
midnight. Officer Gillepsie going to invest-
igate found in the open hallway a man dying
with a bullet hole in his neck and bending
over him the proprietress, Ray Raymond.
Investigations develop the facts that the
man, James Finch by name, had gone into the
house under the influence of liquor, had been
ordered away, but refusing to go to the keeper
of the disreputable place, Ray Raymond, had 
shot him. The woman says that she endeavor-
ed in a peaceable may to induce him to leave,
and that only when the man struck at her did
she resort to the pistol. About 2 o'clock 
Saturday morning the man did. The
woman was taken into custody by the officer
Saturday morning the coroner's inquest was
held, and the verdict marked that deceased
had come to his death by a show from a pis-
tol in the hands of Ray Raymond. The
matter was referred to Justice Peel, com-
plaint entered before him by Prosecuting
Attorney Hyde, and a preliminary exam-
ination commenced Tuesday. It is not
yet concluded."
