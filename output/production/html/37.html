    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In early 1912, Frank Foster and Edwin Jurgens were convicted of assault and robbery with a dangerous weapon in Douglas County, Oregon, and committed to the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem. Homer Rutherford, whose relationship to Foster is unclear, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on Foster's behalf, which was granted. After hearing the evidence, Foster was remanded to the custody of the penitentiary superintendent. After this decision, Foster appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court, but not before motioning the Marion County Circuit Court to remove Rutherford as a petitioner on the case retroactively. This appears to have been done so that Foster, as the sole petitioner, could claim poverty as a reason for not paying some of his court fees. The circuit court granted the motion. While the state supreme court records are not included in the circuit court case file, published reports indicate that the upper court upheld the decision of the lower court.</li>
