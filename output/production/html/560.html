    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On May 2nd, 1923 Anna Cohen filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of her 20 year old son, Eddie Toman. She alleged that Eddie was being unlawfully detained by Michael Dempsey (Sheriff) and Pete Dillon (Chief of Police), for the purpose of being handed over to the State Industrial School (Kearney, Nebraska). Anna wished him free. In a return, Dempsey and Dillon explained that Eddie was committed to the State Industrial School on September 10th, 1913 and that he would be held there until he was 21 years old. But, he escaped the school and they had since been holding him for, on behalf, and at the request of the Superintendent of said school. The Superintendent was present in court and was prepared to take Eddie and return him to school. On January 21st, 1924 the writ was dismissed for want of prosecution. The fate of Eddie is unknown.</li>
