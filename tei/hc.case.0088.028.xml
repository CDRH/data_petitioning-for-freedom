husband.</p>

<p>Q. Has she a good reputation in Tacoma since her husband went away? A. Reputation to that extent, that she is far better woman since her husband left <sic>thay</sic> before, that is people generally talk in that way, that her husband was to blame for her misconduct if misconduct it was.</p>

<p>Q. Dont know who lives there with her? A. No sir</p>

<p>Q. You say she is as capable and as fit a person to have the custody of this child as any woman who has been in her circumstances. Explain what you mean by that? A. Well, her financial condition is not that that would rear a child and educate a child as I would think a child should be reared and educated, of course she cannot do that.</p>

<p>Q. One of the circumstances of her condition is a life of crime that she has lived Dont you consider that one of the circumstances? A. A circumstances that is not of her own making, but that has been made against her, her unhappy domestic relations with her husband. that she is probably a better woman than her deeds make her out to be.</p>

<p>Q. Her reputation of the past has been pretty bad, has it not? A. In that way I suppose it has.</p>

<p>REDIRECT EXAMINATION:</p>

<p>Q. [Ronald] From what you know of her, then she is as competent to raise her children and educate and school them as other poor women? A. That is wha.t I mean, that is, that the same rule that would deprive her of the child would rob a great many women that are considered competent to rear their children.</p>
