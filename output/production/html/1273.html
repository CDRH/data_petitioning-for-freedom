    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Alfred Bradden, a retired US Army sergeant who was employed at the Fort Robinson post exchange, was arrested by the sheriff of Dawes County, Nebraska and charged with violating a state law against selling intoxicating liquors without a license. After making bail, Bradden petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted. He argued that he had only sold wine and beer, which was expressly permitted by federal regulations, and that the state of Nebraska lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute him. After hearing the evidence, Bradden was released from custody.</li>
