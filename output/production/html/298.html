    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On April 16th, 1921, Nick Fort was charged and arraigned for a vagrancy charge for which he plead not guilty but was found by Charles E. Foster, Police Magistrate, to be guilty for. The conviction was appealed to the District Court where Judge L. B. Day denied the appeal for want of jurisdiction by reason of defective bond on appeal. Day ordered that the remainder of the original 30-day sentence be finished. On December 30th, 1921, Fort was arrested again on a state mittimus concerning the previous charge. A petition was then filed on January 3rd, 1922, by Fort which alleged that the mittimus alleges violations of Nebraska State Laws when the original charge was concerned with a City of Omaha Ordinance. On January 4th, 1922, the response from Sheriff Clark was filed and a hearing was scheduled. Judge A. C. Troup found in favor of the petitioner and ordered Fort discharged on January 10th, 1922.</li>
