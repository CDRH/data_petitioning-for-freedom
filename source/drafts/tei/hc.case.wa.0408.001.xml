of court, officer, or body having authority in the premises to
commit; nor upon any warrant issued from the district court upon an indictment
or information; that the cause of pretence of such imprisionment
according to the best knowledge and belief of your petitioner, is
aas follows, to wit: a warrant issued outof a court of the Justice of
the Peace in Seattle Precinct in said City of Seattle, by T.H. Cann,
one of the Justices of the Peace in and for said precinct, on the 11th
day of March 1884, directed to the Sheriff or any Constable of said County,
directing and commanding him to apprehend forthwith the petitioner
which said warrant was issued upon an information filed in said Justice

J.H. Woolery, on the 10th day of March 1884 charging the peitioner
with having committed the crime of Grand Larceny on the <gap></gap>
day of <gap></gap> 1884, by feloniously stealing a horse in
<pb></pb>
in said state of Oregon. In which information it is stated that the 
complaint therein contained is made from information received by telegram,
recieved that date. That the pretended cause for the <del>future</del> <add>further</add> continuance

was issued to said J.H. McGraw, Sheriff aforesaid any commitment by
any authority of law or court authorized to issue the same or any mandate
<pb></pb>

or any examination whatever, had been wholly refused and denied

of delievering him therefrom and discharging him from custody.</p>
