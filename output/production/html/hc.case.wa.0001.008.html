 or talk with her. Refused to let <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">William[?]</span> see or talk with her - <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Ray Raymond[?]</span> present she said Frank Teller I think might have said her husband I gave her instructions before I asked her for the Revolver -- I asked her if she had a thick Revolver -- or fire arms of any kind on her person -- asked her if it was the Revolver she done the shooting out there with said she shot twice before he fell - Dont think she said anything about riding up with the gun but that she done it in self defense and under the fear that he would kill her if she had not him. She did not portend to go into a detailed statement of the affair.</p>
