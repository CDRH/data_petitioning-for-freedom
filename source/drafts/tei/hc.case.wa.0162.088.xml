The affidavit were led to find said Donaldson
by information received by them that
he had declared he was present at time
of the shooting that in said interview said
Donaldson did not know affiant that Wycoff
witnessed the killing, but on the contrary
did tell them that he occupied a position
where it would have been impossible for

<pb/>

him to have seen a part of the scuffle or
shooting or that it would not
be worth her while to see Wycoff as he
knew nothing about it and subsequently 
and about the time of the interview
at the "Bay Windows" spoken of in Donaldson 
affidavit said Donaldson himself
told affiants that said Wycoff was
gone from his hand and to Walla
Walla County somewhere harvesting
notwithstanding and as soon as he
knew of his return would inform
affiant and he never did inform affiants 
that he had so returned until
after the finding of this indictment.

Precinct said Donaldson did not tell affiants 
that he witnessed said shooting

That several days after the finding
of this indictment affiant finds
as late at the 8th day of this month that
affiants learned that said Donaldson
would be a witness
for the prosecution and that he
claimed to be an eye-witness to the
ahooting anf this was the first any of defendants 
counsel or defendant knew that he
would be a witness in this cause or
that they did not know Wycoff by sight
nor did they knowledge except Donaldson who did know him by sight
and had no means of finding him 
until after they were informed by the sheriff that
and either of affiants now and him to know him until he was 
he was on Spokane Falls which was about
the time stated in their previous affidavit
herein, that defendants counsel were well
known to all persons in attendance upon
this court and said Wycoff did not make himself 
know either to defendant or any of
her counsel although subpoenas to attend
at her behalf, that the prosecuting attorney has

<pb/>

never notified defendant or her attorneys of his
purpose to use said witnesses Donaldson
&amp; Wycoff or either of the or of what he expected
to prove by them and they only learned if at first
incidentally and inquiry disclosed the fact that
they were Donaldson was so attending
this court for said purpose. That the presence
of said Donaldson in Spokane Falls and about
the court room did not inform affiants of
any thing as his presence in Spokane Falls
was not unusual. J. Kennedy Stout
