    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On May 2nd, 1921, Mary Foley and Thomas Foley petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of their daughter, Agnes Smith. The petition revealed that in 1913 Agnes was committed to the Girls' Industrial School for a period of two years, but was detained for five years. She was then committed to the Institute for Feeble-Minded Youth against her will and without proper noticed to her parents. Mary and Thomas Foley asserted that Agnes was not feeble-minded. The Foleys named S. J. Stewart, the superintendent of the Institute for Feeble-Minded Youth, and members of the Board of Control as respondents. The petition was granted. In a return, S. J. Stewart assured the court that he was legally detaining Agnes due to a decree made by W. R. Fulton, a Fillmore county judge. The decree ordered Agnes detained to the Institute for Feeble-Minded Youth because it was what was best for her and society. On May 14th, the writ was denied and Agnes remained in custody. Judge L. W. Colby affirmed that Agnes was duly committed and a "fit and proper subject" for the Institution.</li>
