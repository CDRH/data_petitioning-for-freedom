    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Joseph Hajek, the petitioner, files a writ of Habeas Corpus in an effort to regain custody of his son, Frank Hajek, who was eight years of age in 1905. John and Mary Terry of Ravenna had custody of Frank since his mother died in 1903. They were the boy's aunt and uncle. Judge Kennedy denies the writ of habeas corpus. John and Mary Terry were found to be best able to ensure Frank's welfare, and he stayed in their custody, with Joseph never getting in touch with the boy. Joseph Hajek then petitioned again under Judge George A. Day for the custody of his son, likely because he had recently remarried. Judge Day found that Frank is unlawfully detained and Joseph Hajek was awarded custody of Frank. </li>
