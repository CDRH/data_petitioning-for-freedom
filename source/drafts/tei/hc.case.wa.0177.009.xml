<p>EXHIBIT F.</p>

<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application
of Tonka Bajlo for the Writ of 
Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>2459
No. 1328</p>

<p>AFFIDAVIT OF FRANK MILLOWAN.</p>

<p>STATE OF WASHINGTON
COUNTY OF KING ) ss. </p>

<p>Frank Millowan being first duly sworn on oath deposes
and says; that I reside at 623 King Street, Seattle, Washington;
that by occupation I am an insurance collector and work for the
Great Eastern Casualty Company with offices in the Globe Building
on First Avenue in Seattle, Washington, and have resided in the
City of Seattle about a year; that I am an Austrian by birth
and speak Austrian, Russian, Polish, Hungarian and English languages;
that I solicit insurance among people of those nations
as well as American people; that I have know Tonka Bajlo about
two months; that I first met her while soliciting insurance at
815 Charles Street, Seattle, Washington; that ever since I have
known her she was working as cook and housekeeper at 815 Charles 
Street, wherin boarded some half dozen Austrian laborers; that I
know John Skorich who lives at 815 Charles Street and that I solicited
him for insurance; that I know a man by the name of Paska Bilin,
who resides at the same place, and I became acquainted with some
three or four other Austrians who lived there through soliciting
them for insurance and became very well acquainted with them. 
That all of them stated to me during my conservations with them
when I would be visiting the place, that the woman who was there
whose name was Tonka Bajlo, was working as a cook and keeping house;
that I never heard anything except that she was a good, hard working
<pb/>
woman and never heard anyting detrimental to her character. I 
heard several of them state that her husband was cruel to her and
that she was unable to live with him because of his cruelty, and
that she was sickly and in poor health because of the cruelty
which her husband had inflicted upon her, and that she refused to
live with her husband because he had been very cruel to her and 
continually beat her and subjected her to all kinds of cruelties;
that I called at 814 Charles Street many times and became acquainted
with all of the boarders, adn acquainted with people in the immediate
neighborhood, and if Tonka Bajlo had been a woman of disreputable
character and guilty of the charge of prostitution which was made
against her, I would have had an opportunity to know of it; that 
the house which was numbered 815 Charles Street, consists of three
rooms and a kitchen; that the room which Tonka Bajlo occupied was
what was known as the front room facing the street. but there was
no outside door to it, and the room next to her was occupied by
John Skorich and another man and there was an outside entrance to
this room; that the third bedroom was occupied by three or four
men, and next to the kitchen; that the kitchen has an outside door 
entrance.</p>
<p>That I travel around many railroad camps and construction
camps among the districts of laborers of foreign nations of this
country, and this is not an unusual condition to find and is very
common, and it is customary for a man or wife or single woman to
engage to keep a boarding camp for laborers who work on the streets,
railroads and construction camps; that there is no stigma attached
to any woman who engages in such an occupation and lives in the same
way as Tonka Bajlo, when a warrant was issued for her arrest upon
the charge of being an alien, guilty of prostitution; tha ton or 
about the 2nd day of April, 1913, I was called upon to act as an
interpreter for Tonka Bajlo at her residence at 815 Charles Street.</p>
<pb/>
<fw>-2-</fw>
<p>Upon the occasion of a visit of her husband to that place when she
called upon the police for protection, her husband at that time 
having made threats that he would kill her, and she had locked
herself up in a room by herself when I arrived; that previous
to this occasion I had seen letters written by said Jack Bajlo,
her husband, in which he threatened to kill Tonka Bajlo and all
of the boarders at 815 Charles Street; that after the police had
threatened to arrest him, he begged that she let him go free from
arrest and stated that he would not bother her any more; that Tonka
Bajlo told her husband at that time that she would not live with 
him; that she had left him because he had been cruel to her and
beat her, and that she would not live with him as his wife as long
as she remained alive.</p>
<p>That from my general knowledge of the reputation of Tonka
Bajlo and from expressions I have heard from those who knew her, I 
believe her to be a good woman of virtuous character and industrious
habits. I never heard anything ill of her previous to the charge
made by the Government that she was practicing prostitution.</p>
