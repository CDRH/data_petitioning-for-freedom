    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Howard L. Rucker was arrested because of a warrant issued by the governor of Iowa, Albert B. Cummins. This was ordered because Rucker was charged with the crime of cheating by false pretenses as a fugitive from justice in Iowa. John H. Mickey, the governor of Nebraska, orders his arrest. Rucker was charged with cheating because he told J. W. Martin and P. P. Louck that a town named Morris had been laid out in the territory of Oklahoma and that it was in a flourishing condition. He told them there was a store, other buildings were in construction, the railway system had a line close to town and that the railroad into town was nearly completed. The two men purchased ten lots and later found out that all statements were false. This case stretched through three more years before &#x201C;Nolle&#x201D; was entered by order of the court. </li>
