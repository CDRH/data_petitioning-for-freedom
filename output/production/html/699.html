    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Petitioner, Ms. Gertrude Bloomfield, asserts that Chief Sigwart is unlawfully holding Pearl Proto (a five year old child). Petitioner states that she was granted custody by the mother of said child and that Pearl was forcibly taken from Ms. Bloomfield on 29 August 1896 and has since been held, unlawfully, by Chief Sigwart. This statement was sworn and signed in front of Notary Public Wilbur M. Lemon on 31 August 1896. Ms. Bloomfield and her attorney, Mr. Lee Helsley, appeared before Judge Fawcett on 31 August 1896. He stated that the writ should not be allowed to Ms. Bloomfield as it was written in her petition. Instead, he asked that Ms. Bloomfield and Sheriff Sigwart appear in court before District Court Judge Baker on 5 September 1896. A document filed on 2 June 1898 notes that this case was remanded for costs to the trial court. The motion to tax the costs of the trial to the county was filed that same day by Albyn L. Frank (Clerk for the District Court), the motion was sustained by Judge Fawcett on 14 June 1898. 
It is not clear what the conclusion of the case heard before Judge Baker was. Judge Fawcett simply states that the writ should not be allowed and lists a time and place for a further trial, there is no further information.</li>
