    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Pearl Wilson filed a habeas corpus petition on December 2, 1918, stating that Omaha police had arrested her without a warrant in her house around December 1, 1918. Wilson also stated that&#x2014;without description of why she was allegedly guilty&#x2014;she was charged with disorderly conduct and prostitution. The case file includes a vagrancy and prostitution complaint form signed by Police Magistrate C. W. Britt and City Prosecutor John M. Berger, with witnesses listed as "Various Handymen." Wilson was then tried before the Omaha Police Magistrate on December 2, 1918 and sentenced to thirty (30) days in the Douglas County jail. Wilson stated that the written sentence did not specify which offense she was being sentenced to jail for, which violated the requirements of the law. Judge William A. Reddick issued an order allowing writ of habeas corpus and commanded that Sheriff Michael L. Clark appear before the court. Clark received the writ but returned it "Not served by direction of Attorney for Defendant," which could suggest that the claim was resolved outside of court. The fate of Wilson is unknown.</li>
