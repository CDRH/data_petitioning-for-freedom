    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On July 14th, 1920, Henry Bonnemeyer was arrested under the charge of "aiding, abetting, and contributing to the delinquency" of a minor, Ruth Funnel. Upon his arrest, he went to trial, where he was tried without a jury and declared guilty by judge Willis G. Sears. Bonnemeyer and his attorneys disputed the illegality of his 90 day prison sentence by filing a petition of Habeas Corpus. Their argument was based on the fact that Bonnemeyer was an adult tried by a juvenile court and that no county attorney ever filed evidence against him. These facts were enough, they claimed, to warrant his release. After the petition hearing, it appears that their writ was dismissed; however, Bonnemeyer and his attorneys made a plea for demurrer against the respondent's evidence for Bonnemeyer's captivity. Based on the appearance docket, it seems that the judge, again, dismissed their plea and Bonnemeyer remained in captivity. </li>
