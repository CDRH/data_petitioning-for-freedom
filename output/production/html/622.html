    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Although the original petition for Writ is missing in the case file, based on the docket, Carol Williams filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against Alta Berger on December 9, 1919. On the same day, the Judge filed a writ of habeas corpus. However, included in the case file was Berger's return to writ. Her return to writ states that, on December 8, 1919, the courts prosecuted Williams on a charge of vagrancy and prostitution. She was found guilty and sentenced to thirty days in county jail. Berger claimed that she managed the Detention Hospital and that, by an Ohama ordinance, certain venereal diseases, such as "syphilis, gonorrhea, and chancroid" were "declared to be contagious, infectious, communicable and a menace to public health." She claimed that the law declared that it was unlawful for any person with such disease(s) to knowingly expose other people and required the Health Commissioner, Deputies, and Assistants to examine all persons convicted in a court for prosecution for the diseases. If said person was said to have a venereal disease, the person must be detained at the hospital. They examined Williams, and her result was positive for venereal disease, so they committed her to the Girl's Detention Home for examination and treatment. On December 13, 1919, Williams requested a continuance (it is unclear why), and the judge ordered a five-day continuance. However, on December 18, 1919, the judge dismissed the proceeding because Williams failed to appear by counsel or otherwise in court. </li>
