issued by the Clerk of said Court under
the seal thereof bearing

mitted against the law of the
United States and that he was
charged in said indictment
with having sold and given spirituous
liquors in said District to certain
Indians therein named, subsequent
to the 22nd day of June 1874 said

tinually imprisoned and restrained

ment does not charge said J.J. Johnson with any offense
against the law of the United States

time of the <unclear></unclear> thereof was
and now is illegal and void</p>

that a writ of habeas corpus

manding him to have the body

theretin to be specified, to do and
receive, what shall then and

Honor concerning him together
with the time and cause of his

that he may be restored to
his liberty.</p>
