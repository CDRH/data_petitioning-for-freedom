<ab>Terrority of Washington
3rd Judicial District
S.S.</ab>
<p>In the District Court holding terms at
Seattle in King County.
In the Matter of the Application of
Antony Hain for a Writ of 
Habeas Corpus</p>
<p>To the Hon. J.R. Lewis, Chief Justice of
Washington Terrority and Judge of the 3rd 
Judicial District therein: </p>
<ab>The petition and complaint of Anthony Han
respectfully shows:</ab>
<p>That the said Antony Hain, is unlawfully
imprisoned, detained, confined and re-
strained of his liberty by L.V. Wyckoff, the 
Sheriff of King County, at the county jail,
in county of King in the Territory of
Washington.</p>
<p>That the said imprisonment, detention,
confinement and restraint is illegal;
and that the illegality thereof consists in
this, to wit:</p>
<p>The cause or pretense of the said
imprisonment, detention, confinement
and restraint is a certain commitment
issued by me, Samuel Greene, who is or
pretends to be a Justice of the Peace in
and for said county, which commitment
commits said Antony Hain to the <add>said</add> county
jail for six months upon the sentence
of said Justice upon a trial before said
Justice of said Antony Hain upon a 
<pb></pb>
charge of petit lancery, the said Justice
having sentenced said Antony Hain to
six months imprisonment <del>of</del> as a
punishment for said allegded petit
lancery, which sentence, commitment, 
and all the proceedings thereunder are 
illegal and void because the said
Justice had no jurisdiction to pronounce
such sentence and <add>no</add> authority
or jurisdiction to enforce the same. </p>
<p>Wherefore your petitioner and complainant
prays that a Writ of Habeas 
Corpus may be granted directed
to the said L.V. Wyckoff, sheriff
as aforsaid, commanding him to 
have the body of said Anthony Hain 
before your honor at a time and place
therein to be specified to do and recieve
what shall then and there be considered
by your Honor concerning said Antony
Hain together with the time and
cause of His detention and said Writ
and that he the said Han may be restored 
to his liberty. </p>
