<p>To the Honorable Henry Dusenbury Judge of the St Louis Law Commissioner's Court St at Chambers</p>

<p>Your Petitioner James Allison Parker, a free man 
of color aged about twenty two or three years would respectfully 
represent to your Honor that he now is confined 
in the Saint Louis County Jail by Rodermann 
the keeper of said Jail, and has been so confined 
since the 11th day of the present month, September, by virtue of 
a certain warrant order or process issued by me Peter 
W Johnstone, a Justice of Saint Louis County. A full 
and complete copy of all the papers pertaining to the 
case now in the possession of said Jailor is herewith 
presented and made a part of this application</p>

<p>Your petitioner would further represent 
that said confinement is <unclear>wholly</unclear> illegal. The pretense 
under which your petitioner is held in as will 
appear from said copy of the commitment <unclear>re</unclear> is 
that he is a runaway slave whereas 
your petitioner alleges the fact to be that he 
was born and raised in the County of St 
Clair and State of Illinois - that he is therefore 
free and not a slave that his mother 
is <del>and always has been</del> a free woman 
and not a slave</p>

<p>Your petitioner therefore in view of 
the premises prays your honor that the States 
writ of Habeas Corpus may issue in his 
behalf forthwith directed to the said Rodermann 
by whom your petitioner is restrained 
of his liberty, commanding him to have 
the body of your petitioner so imprisoned together with

the cause of such imprisonment before this 
Hon Court without delay, to do and 
receive what shall then and there be considered 
touching the matters herein before 
set forth and that no application for the relief 
sought for by this petitioner has been made to and refused 
by any court officer of 
officers superior to the one to whom 
this petitioner is presented</p>

<p>James Allison Parker by Attorney</p>
