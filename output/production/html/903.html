    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On February 1st, 1924, Lee Holmes petitioned for and was given an order allowing a writ of Habeas Corpus after he had been arrested and imprisoned in Omaha Nebraska in January of that year. He had been arrested on the charge of issuing a check with insufficient funds to meet same. He was given a hearing on said charges in January where he was bound over to the district court under $1500. The Municiple court ordered his release but the bond having been filed with surety guaranteed his appearance in a district court. In his petition Holmes presented that since the time of his arrest to the release order from the Municipal court he had been held in custody by Charles H Van Deusen who refused to allow him his liberty and thus he was being imprisoned without legal authority. It was the 2nd of February that the writ was denied, and Holmes was remanded to custody.</li>
