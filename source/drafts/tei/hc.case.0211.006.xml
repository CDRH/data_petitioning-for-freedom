<p>5210</p>

<p>Filed in the United States District Court</p>
<p>Western District of Washington</p>
<p>Northern Division</p>

<p>Tx</p>

<p>Apr 6 1920</p>

<p>F.M. Harshberger, Clerk</p>
<p>By S.E. Leitch Deputy</p>

<pb/>

<p>No. 5210</p>

<p>Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Moy Share Park for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>To the Honorable Jeremiah Neterer, District Judge:</p>

<p>Comes now Moy Share Park, petitioner, by and through his attorneys, Hugh C. Todd and James V. Storey, and petitions this court to issue a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of the detention of said Moy Share Park by Hon. Henry M. White, Commissioner of Immigration at Seattle, Washington, and show to the court as follows:</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>That Moy Share Park applied for admission into the United States as a citizen thereof, being the natural son of Moy Wah How, a native born citizen of the United States, and thereby a member of the exempt class under the treaty between the Government of the United States and the Government of China and the laws of the United States, and is now detained at the United States Immigration Station at Seattle, Washington, by the said Henry M. White, commisioner of Immigration at Seattle, Washington, in the proceedings from his application to be admitted into the United States.</p>

<p>11.</p>

<p>That the said Moy Share Park is imprisoned and restrained of his liberty by the said Commissioner of Immigration at said Immigration Station; that he has not been committed and is not detained by virtue of any judgement, decree, final order or process issued by a court or judge of the United States, in a case where such courts or judges have exclusive jurisdiction under the laws of the United States, or have acquired exclusive jurisdiction by commencement of legal proceedings in such a court, nor is he detained by virtue of the final judgment or decree of a court of competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction or the final order of such a tribunal made in the special proceedings instituted for any cause except to punish him for contempt; or by virtue of an execution or other process issued upon such a judgment, decree or final order; or by virtue of a warrant issud from any court upon an indictment or information.</p>

<p>111.</p>

<p>That the cause or pretense of the imprisonment and restraint of the said Moy Share Park, according to the best knowledge and belief of your petitioner, is that the said Commissioner ruled that the said Moy Share Park was an alen person, not a member of any of the exempt classes of Chinese entitled to come into or remain in the United States, and accordingly refused him admission, from which finding an appeal was taken to the Secretary of Labor, which said appeal was thereupon denied by the Secretary of Labor on the 3rd day of April 1920.</p>

<p>1V.</p>

<p>That the decision of the above named officials denying admission, is based upon the ground and for the reason that said officials have a suspicion that the said Moy Share Park is not a citizen of the United States, which said ruling is illegal, wrongful, contrary to the laws of the United States, and in violating of the Treaty between the Government of the United States and the Government of China respecting and governing the admission and exclusion of the subjects of China into and from the United States.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p>That the facts developed by the hearings in said petitioner's case by said officials is insufficient to justify the decision that said petitioner is not of the said exempt class; that no evidence whatsoever was introduced by the immigration officials, or can be found in the record, to disprove the contention that said petitioner is not entitled to be admitted into the United States as the son of a native born citizen thereof; that said decision is arbitrary and contrary to law, and based entirely on suspicion and conjecture; that said immigration officials thereby greatly abused their discretion and did not accord said petition a fair hearing.</p>

<p>V1.</p>

<p>That the said Moy Share Park is being restrained of his liberty without due process of law, in violation of the provisions of the constitution of the United States and the laws and treaties governing such cases made and provided; that he is wrongfully, illegally and arbitrarily restrained of his liberty, and</p>

<pb/>

<p>that the said immigration officials are about to deport him, and that unless this court intervenes he will be deported forthwith.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE your petitioner prays that a writ of habeas corpus may issue directed to Hon. Henry M. White, Commissioner of Immigration, at Seattle, Wash., commanding him to have the body of the said Moy Share Park before Hon. Jeremiah Neterer, Judge of the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, Northern Division, at the Federal Court Building in Seattle, Washington, at o'clock A.M. on the <gap></gap> day of April, 1920, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered concerning the said Moy Share Park, together with the time and cause of his detention.</p>

<p>Dated April 5th, 1920.</p>

<p>ss.</p>

<p>HUGH C. TODD, being first duly sworn on oath deposes and says:</p>

<p>That he is one of the attorneys and next friend of Moy Share Park, the petitioner in the above entitled matter; that he makes this petition and verification for and on his behalf on account of and for the reason that said petitioner does not write in English; that this affiant knows the contents of said petition and believes the same to be true, and in behalf of said petitioner has full authority to sign and verify the same.</p>

<p>Hugh C Todd</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 5th day of April, 1920.</p>
