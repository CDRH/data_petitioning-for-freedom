<p>In the District Court of the United States, in and for the
Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>
<p>In the Matter of Marie Miler
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, } No. 2457</p>
<p>Reply of Marie Miller to Answer and
Return of Ellis DeBruller, Commissioner
of Immigration.</p>
<p>Comes now Marie Miler and by way of reply to the 
further and separate answer and further return of Ellis DeBruller,
Commissioner, alleges:</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Petitioner admits that she was arrested by one Thomas
M. Fisher, an Inspector of Immigration, on or about the 8th day
of January, 1913, under purported authority from the Department
of Labor of the United States, and charged with being an alien
found in the United States in violation of the Act of Congress
Feburary 20th, 1907, as amended by the Act approved March 26th,
1910, but petitioner specifically denies that she is a member
of one of the classes of aliens required to be deported under
the laws of the United States, as outlined by the said Act as
amended March 26th, 1910, and specifically denies that she was
connected with a house of prostitution and practiced prostitution
and derived therefrom after she entered the United States.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Petitioner further denies that she was duly and regularly
examined by the said Thomas M. Fisher, acting Inspector of 
Immigration stationed at Seattle, Washington, and denies that
he acted under the <del/> authority and
laws of the United States and under the rules and regulations
of the Bureau of Immigration and Department of Commerce and Labor
of the United States. Petitioner futher denies specifically
that she was informed that she might, if she wished, employ an
attorney, but alleges the fact to be that it was not until after

<pb/>

the purported examination had been held that she was informed
of her right to be represented by an attorney. Petitioner futher
denies that the said Thomas M. Fisher, and other members 
of the Department of Commerce and Labor stationed at Seattle,
Washington, endeavored to induce Roger Marchetti to present any
other or further evidence which he mightthave touching the matter of 
said deportatioon, and denies further that A.T. White, 
Inspector of said Bureau, personally delievered to said Roger
Marchetti a letter notifying him that further proceedings would
be had on March 7th, 1913, at the Detention House in Seattle,
Washington, and that <add>at</add> the close of said examination the record
would then be submitted to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor
for his decision.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Petitioner denies that Roger Marchetti informed the
Inspector that he could not take the matter up on March 7th, 
1913, but would take it up the next morning without fail. Petitioner
admits that the said Roger Marchetti did not appear in
said proceeding or produce or make any effort to produce any
other or further evidence, but specifically denies that she, the
said Marie or Mary Miler, at any time did not offer to produce
or procure any other or further evidence, but specfically alleges
that she has been ready and willing at all times to procure
further evidence to controvert the evidence introduced 
against her in this proceeding, but has been prevented from so
doing. Petitioner further denies that by reason of the premises
as set forth in Commissioner Ellis DeBruller's answer and return 
to the writ and petition herein on file, that this Court has no
jurisdiction to review the Acts of the Secretary of Commerce
and Labor, or the Acts of the Secretary of Labor who now has
charge of said matter, and therefore prays in accordance with
her petition herein now on file, and that your petitoner may
be restored to her liberty.</p>
