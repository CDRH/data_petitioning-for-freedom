    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In the autumn of 1906, William Walker, a member of the Omaha Nation, was arrested on the Omaha Reservation, charged with having repeatedly beaten his wife, Little Girl Walker, also of the Omaha Nation, and sentenced to thirty days. William was processed in the Omaha Court of Indian Offenses and held in an agency jail, both of which were established earlier that year at the request of the Omaha Nation Tribal Council "to deal with members of our tribe who are guilty of violating moral and civil codes"--specifically issues involving alcohol and domestic violence. According to Superintendent of the Omaha Agency, John Commons, this was necessary because Nebraska state authorities were loathe to enforce these laws on Omaha land. William petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, which was granted. After hearing the evidence, which was largely about the legitimacy and jurisdiction of the Court of Indian Offenses, William was released from custody.</li>
