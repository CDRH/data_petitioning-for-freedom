    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 26th, 1920, Fred Sailor was arrested and charged with vagrancy. Subsequently, he was allegedly found guilty of these charges before a police magistrate and was sentenced to 60 days in the county jail. On September 8th, 1920, Sailor filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus alleging that the plea of guilty was entered against him and that the magistrate refused to accept an appeal bond as a result of his guilty plea. Originally, the result of this writ was that Judge A. C. Troup denied the writ, ordered a new trial at the lower court with the plea of not guilty, and remanded custody to the police court. on September 9th, 1920, T. B. Murray, Attorney for the City of Omaha, filed a motion to set aside the order of the court claiming that the facts of the petition were false and that he had no notification of the proceedings the day before and thus could not represent the City. On September 10th, 1920, Judge Troup vacated their order, denied the writ, and remanded custody of Sailor to the Sheriff. It is unclear, but likely, that as a result of the Judge vacating their original order, a new trial was not granted.</li>
