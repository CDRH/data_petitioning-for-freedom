    <li>Summary of Proceedings: William H. Geary and William Williams were seamen upon the Barque Cambridge ship. On May 5, they petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus and stated that their voyage concluded at Port Townsend in 1872. After the voyage concluded, they asked to be paid and discharged from the ship. The ship captain filed a complaint to Commissioner Burns and they were charged with mutiny. They argued that the commissioner violated an act authorizing commissioners to superintend the shipping and discharge of seamen by charging them based only on the oral evidence of the captain. On May 7, Judge Orange Jacobs approved the petition. On May 9, Judge Jacobs ordered the respondent to bring Geary and Williams before the court. On May 12, the respondent replied and stated that Commissioner Burns ordered him to detain Geary and Williams until their trial date. The judge then remanded Geary and Williams into the custody of the respondent to await trial.</li>
