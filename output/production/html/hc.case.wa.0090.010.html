County and Territory.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">That the bail required of petitioner in said cause to wit $1500 is excessive unjust and oppression.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That the said N. Soderberg has in consequence of certain criminal proceedings against him in this court become disqualified to act as Justice of the Peace and is not now competent to proceed further in said cause against petitioner and is not now a Justice of the Peace.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That by reason of the premises the said N. Soderberg has lost all jursidiction over petitioner and she cannot now be legally held or imprisoned by any order of commitment issued by him</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That the illegality of said imprisonment consists in the following</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That said N. Soderberg has failed and refused to proceed in said alleged cause against petitioner, as by law directed: that he has failed and refused to give to this petitioner a trial and hearing in said cause. That petitioner has never asked for a continuance of said cause and no reason or cause has existed to prevent such <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">hearing[?]</span> within a reasonable time except a desire on the part of the said N.
