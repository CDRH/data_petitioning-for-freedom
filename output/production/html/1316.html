    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In the summer of 1919, Marie Shelton petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the Marion County Circuit Court to retrieve her daughter, referred to as both Josephine Shelton and Josephine Matlock, from Florence and Lloyd Weeks, which was granted. Marie was Josephine's "natural" mother as well as her mother "by virtue of adoption." In 1909, after divorcing Josephine's father, Clyde Maulding, Marie permitted Josephine to be adopted by Clyde's sister, meaning Josephine's aunt, Cora Matlock. Florence Weeks was Cora's daughter, making her Josephine's first cousin as well as foster sister during this time period. Then, in 1916, Cora died, and her husband, C. N., permitted Marie to adopt Josephine, which proceeding was carried out in the Multnomah County Court of Domestic Relations. The Weeks, who had become de facto guardians of Josephine after Cora's death, refused to relinquish the child to Marie. Marie accused the Weeks of holding Josephine for financial gain, making her do "house work and other drudgery" and holding out on her eventual inheritance. The Weeks accused Marie of being an unfit mother, citing her precarious finances, multiple divorces, and general character. After hearing the evidence, the court denied Marie's writ and awarded custody of Josephine to Lloyd and Florence Weeks.</li>
