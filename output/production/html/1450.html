    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Frank Kadlec&#x2019;s roommate, James Kasper, picked up a pair of glasses belonging to Kadlec. In retaliation, Kadlec took Kasper's watch and told him that he would not return it until he got his glasses back. Kasper then filed a complaint claiming Kadlec had committed grand larceny for taking the watch. Kadlec was described as being a &#x201C;foreigner, unable to read or write the English language readily&#x201D; and therefore did not have a good understanding of the law. He was the sole provider for his wife and five kids and during his incarceration one his sons died and his family is experiencing starvation and poverty. For these reasons, he wanted to be released from jail. The judge approved the writ and Kadlec was released from jail. </li>
