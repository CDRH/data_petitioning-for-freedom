<p>No. 1317</p>

<p>In the United States Circuit Court for the Western district of Washington Northern Division</p>

<p>In the matter of the petition of Earnest Hutchinson for writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Order for writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Filed in the U.S. Circuit Court. JUL 27 1905. A. Reeves Ayres, Clerk.</p>

<p>Carroll and Carroll, Attorney's for Petitioner</p>

<pb/>

<p>In the United States Circuit Court of the Ninth Circuit In and For the Western District of Washington Northern Division</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Petition of Earnest Hutchinson for Writ of Habeas Corpus. No. 1317. Order for Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>And now upon reading the verified petition of Earnest Hutchinson for a writ of habeas corpus whereby it appears that he is 
       illegally imprisoned and restrained of his liberty by L.C. Smith, the sheriff of King County, State of Washington, at the county
       jail in the City of Seattle, in said county, and stating wherein the alleged illegality consists, from which it appears that a writ of
       habeas corpus ought to issue, and the court being fully advised in the premises.</p>

<p>IT IS ORDERED that a writ of habeas corpus issue out of and under the seal of this court, directed to the said sheriff, commanding him to
       have the body of the said Earnest Hutchinson, by him imprisoned and detained, together with the cause of said imprisonment and detention
       before me, Judge of the aforesaid court, at the United States court room in the Federal building at the corner of 4th Avenue and Marion Street
       in the City of Seattle, King County, State of Washington, at 10 o'clock a.m., on the 7th day of August 1905, to do and receive what shall then
       and there be considered or ordered concerning the said Earnest Hutchinson, in purusnace of the statute in such case made and provided.</p>

<p>Dated this 27th day of July, A.D., 1905.</p>

<p>C.H. Hanford. Judge.</p>
