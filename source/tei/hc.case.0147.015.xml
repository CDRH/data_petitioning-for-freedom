for a writ of Habeas Corpus
Territory of Washington
County of Spokane}ss
To the Hon. George Turner, Judge of
the District Court of the 4th Judicial
District, holding terms at county
dept of Spokane County, Wash
Territory.
The petition of Ray Raymond
made and presiding for and on
her behalf by her attorney Thomas
C. Griffith, respectfully shows:
1. That the said Ray Raymond
is unlawfully imprisoned, de-
tained, confined and restrained
of her liberty by E.F. Whittier,
Sheriff and keeper of the jail of
Spokane County, Wash. Territory
at the County Jail of said County
at and within the city of Cheney
in said Spokane County, Territory
aforesaid.
2. That the cause and pretense of said
imprisonment, restraint, and
restraint according to the best
knowledge and belief of the ap-
plicant and affidavit herein is
as follows:
Said Whittier restrained said
Ray Raymond is prison as
aforesaid by virtue of a certain
warrant of commitment
directed to city constable and
to the keeper of the jail of Spokane 
County aforesaid from J.J.L. Paul
and Jud. J. Borge, the Justice
of the Peace of said Spokane 
County, dated July 2nd 1886, com-
manding him to to detain her
wihtout bail in the jail aforesaid
on a charge of murder in the
1st degree- the killing one
John W. Frick, at and
within Spokane County
Washington Territory, June 
26, 1886, until discharged
by due cause of law.
3. That such imprisonment and
restraint of said Ray Ray-
mond is wrongful and
illegal in this.
a. Ray Raymond is not guilty of
of the said charge in said warrant
of commitment named, nor is the charge
of ther guilt, thereof evident, nor the
presumption great.
b. That no such crime as mur-
der in 1st degree in the killing
of said John W. Frick has been
committed.
c. That said Ray Raymond
is entitled to bail on said
charge, <del>and that does not thought</del>
and bail is wrongfully denied
her thereon.
d. That the evidence addresed by the
Territory of Washington against
said Ray Raymond on said 
charge, fails to show that the
crime of murder in the 1st degree
in the killing of John W. Frick
had been committed, rather
the proof thereof was evident
or the presumption thereof
great, without Ray Raymond
had committed such crime
of murder in the 1st degree
but such evidence shows that
a less offense had been committed 
if any and that she is enti-
tled to bail on said charge.
The said Ray Raymond
is entitled to bail be admitted to rule
on the said charge, for which she is
so held and restrained by said
Whittier and said thereon is
wrongfully and unlawfully
denied her, and she asks to
have the witnesses against
her examining <del>and</del> further
purpose of admitting her
to bail thereon.
Ray Raymond is entitled
to bail on said charge further
further names that she is and
ever since June 26, 1886, has 
been subject to payment pile
of swooning and bu stria
and she has been advised
by her physician Dr. J. M.
Morgan that further con-
finement in said jail
will greatly endanger her
life, and under her malady
permanent and passably veneting in
insanity, death
sealed July 5, 1886 Ray Raymond
