    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Rose Baker was forcibly arrested when she was asleep in her room by a police officer without a warrant on June 3rd, 1912. The petition said no complaint had been filed in any court nor any warrants. The next day, Rose was taken before a judge and they filed a complaint charging her with being willfully idle, which constituted a misdemeanor under city ordinances. Baker entered a plea of guilty and asked the court to pronounce judgement, which they did not do. The petition was filed also because she was being kept without due process of law. A affidavit in forma pauperis was also filed for Rose Baker. A demurrer of respondent was also written that the petitioner "does not state facts sufficient to entitle the petitioner to have said writ of habeas issued". The fate of the writ and Rose Baker is unknown and not included in this case file.</li>
