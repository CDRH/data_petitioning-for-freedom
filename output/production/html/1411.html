    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Joseph L. Williams petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to establish custody of his son, Joseph T. Williams, which was granted. The younger Williams was being held by a man named Elmer Harris, whose wife appeared in court to surrender the boy to his father. Elmer Harris was the boy's grandfather, and his daughter, the boy's mother, had died shortly after the child's birth. Since the respondents attempted no defense, the younger Williams was released into the custody of his father.</li>
