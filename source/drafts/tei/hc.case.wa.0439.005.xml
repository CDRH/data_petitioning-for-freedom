Your petitioner Thomas Kerr would most respectfully show

building recently constructed by the said William Cochrane
and situated near the court house in the City of Seattle
in said County and Territory.</p>

<p>That the cause or pretense of the restraint according
to the best of knowledge and belief of your petitioner is

the illegality thereof consists in this that the said
Justice of the Peace N. Soderberg has no power under law
to try petitioner  for the offense described in said commitment.
A copy of said commitment is hereto attached marked,
exhibit A, and made a part of this petition.</p>

<p>That the said pretened warrant of commitment is and
arbitrary order for imprisonment of your petitioner without
any just cause therefor and that the same is wholly
null and void and is no authority to said sheriff for the
imprisonment of your petitioner.</p>

<p>Wherefor your petitioner prays that a Writ of Habeas
Corpus may be granted directed to the said William Cochrane
sheriff as aforesaid commanding him to have the body of the
said Thomas Kerr before your Honor at a time and place
therein to be specified to do and receive which shall then
and there be considered by your honor concerning said
Thomas Kerr together with the time and cause of his
detention and said writ; and that he said Kerr may be
restored to, his liberty.</p>
