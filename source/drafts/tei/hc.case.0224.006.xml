<p>ROBERT TATE
821 Campbell Ave. 
called as a witness, being first
sworn, testified as follows:</p> 
<p>QUESTIONS by MR KENNEDY:</p> 
<p>50 Q. What is your occupation? A Porter and waiter.</p> 
<p>51 Q. Do you know Lewis Johnston? A Yes sir</p> 
<p>52 Q. How long have you known him? A. A little over a year</p> 
<p>53 Q. Do you remember the 4th of June? A. I really don't know
the date, but I remember Friday, Saturday morning. I paid no
attention to the date.</p> 
<p>54 Q. How many Saturdays ago? A. Pardon me, just a minute. I
paid no attention to the date.</p>
<p>55 Q. But how many weeks ago? Would you know how many Saturdays
have intervened since then? A. The Saturday before last.</p> 
<p>56 Q. That would be the 5th. Did you see Johnston on that date
A. He came to the house where I live between four and five in
the morning</p> 
<p>57 Q. Where do you live? A. 821 Campbell Avenue</p> 
<p>58 Q. And alone? A. Yes sir I room a lone but there are other
people in the house.</p> 
<p>59 Q. Now I want you to tell us in your own words, please, with
out any prompting what conversation you had with Johnston
in connection with this charge? A. He came to the house 
between 4 and 5 in the morning - I didn't notice the time 
so much either - but he came there really early in the morning
and knocked at the back door, and the lady of the house opened
the door and he asked her for "Bob"</p> 
<p>60 Q. You are "Bob", eh? A. Yes. He said "I want to see him on 
some very important business" So she opened the door and he came
in, and he was in the kitchen when I came down, and she called
to me that Mr Johnston wanted to see me on some very important
business; and I went out there and he had a bottle of Gin and
several packages of cigarettes; and he said he came to give
me the time of my life, that he was going to the States; and
I sat down and had a drink; and he said he had come into some
money</p>
