It had been alleged that the petitioners committed an assault with intent to wound (stabbing) two individuals (referenced as Jordon and Miller). The case file indicates that the two were granted a preliminary hearing and were bound to appear before the District Court. But, as the petition details, there are no actual records of this trial happening. There is no documentation of the two appearing in court, entering pleas, or being sentenced by a trial court. 
The two were originally brought to court on this charge along with a charge for assault with intent to rob in June 1898. When those charges were brought to court, the Jury found the defendants not guilty. They have been confined in the county jail since that arrest despite the conclusion of the Jury. This petition asserts that the charge at hand (assault with intent to wound) was included in the questions assigned to the Jury in June. The Jury also found the petitioners not guilty on a general question of assault and battery. 
On 26 November 1898, Police Judge Gordon issued two separate orders to Sheriff McDonald to secure McGregor and Scott into the County Jail and keep them until they are “discharged by due course of law.” He notes that they are being held for trial in the District Court for the crime of stabbing with intent to wound on 25 June 1898. Each of their bails were set for $700.00, they were to remain in jail unless bail was posted. The petition submitted on behalf of Scott and McGregor states that the petitioners were last “arrested” around a month ago, which lines up with the date that Police Judge Gordon ordered that McDonald and Scott be held in jail until their trial before the District Court. 
On 16 December 1898, Judge Scott (District Court) ordered that the writ be allowed. Sheriff McDonald and Deputy Sheriff Stryker responded that the parties were being held for trial before the District Court, as ordered by Police Judge Gordon. Judge Scott heard the case on 19 December 1898 and decided that the parties would be remanded to custody, at the cost of the petitioners.

Pierce, filed the petition to challenge her detainment for the purpose of deportation by the United States immigration office for ""being an alien and believed to advocate the overthrow of government, [and who] disbelieved in and who opposed organized government"". 
The primary claim for her release was that her detainment was due to a failure to provide her due process. She claimed that her fifth amendment rights were violated. Her claim referred to the answers she provided to an immigration hearing after her arrest in July 1918 (warrant issued June 24) where she admitted that she was a member of the IWW and believed “in mass action and organization,” but denied taking any actual actions. Further, her petition claimed that the evidence against her was based solely on IWW literature that was not actually in her possession at her arrest. Further still, she claimed that the government refused to even turn over the transcript of the hearing or the evidence they attached to it to enable her defence.
The judge approved her writ and demanded that the US government appear to demonstrate its cause for holding her.
In February 1919, the government did appear and provide the transcript of the hearing and the evidence against Roy. The judge ruled that her detainment was lawful and could continue. Presumably, she was deported afterward, but there is no evidence to be certain.
In March 1919, the government of the United States requested that the previously introduced evidence of Roy's hearing and IWW literature be removed from the case file and letters signed by Roy's lawyer agree to that removal.",,"[null, null, null, null, null, null]",[remained in custody],"[null, ""[\""Roy, Margaret\""](hc.pers.002201)|White|[\""In the Matter of the Application of Margaret Roy, for a writ of habeas corpus\""](hc.case.wa.0203)"", null, null, null, null]","[null, ""[\""Roy, Margaret\""](hc.pers.002201)|Female|[\""In the Matter of the Application of Margaret Roy, for a writ of habeas corpus\""](hc.case.wa.0203)"", null, null, null, null]",['British'],,"[None, '[""Roy, Margaret""](hc.pers.002201)|White|[""In the Matter of the Application of Margaret Roy, for a writ of habeas corpus""](hc.case.wa.0203)', None, None, None, None]","Young, D.

He was then arrested again in Multnomah County, convicted of larceny, and returned to the state penitentiary. Houghton appealed this decision to the state supreme court and then filed a writ of habeas corpus in the Marion County Circuit Court, which was granted. Houghton argued that his detention was illegitimate since his conviction was under appeal.

Mary had been living with the Keevans for five years, the Sisters of Charity (Sisters of Providence) having placed Mary with them after Alice placed her daughter into the care of the sisters in 1882 while receiving medical treatment. Shortly after, Alice petitioned for custody of Alice. After having her initial writ denied, Alice utilized a different legal strategy in her second writ. Alice argued to Judge Roger Greene that the Keevans were unfit parents for Mary due to their Catholicism and that they were denying her visitation without reason. The Keevans argued that Alice was a drunk, immoral, abusive, and living in adultery with her neighbor Antone, ""a dark Italian."" Alice countered by claiming that the Keevans were similarly immoral, and that her previous encounters with the law were due to abuse she faced from her now estranged husband, R. G. McKay. Before the court ordered a decision in the case of Mary's custody, Alice and her daughter, Katie, abducted Mary from the Keevans' home the day after Mary's twelfth birthday in 1891. Shortly after, the court ordered Alice to return Mary to the Keevans and Judge Isaac Lichtenberg, who took the case upon the death of Judge Jones, granted custody of Mary to the Keevans. A month after the ruling, Alice and her attorneys filed evidence to the court showing of Della's purchase of alcohol and personal correspondences indicating alcohol abuse. A year after the decision, the Keevans were granted a divorce on account of ""mutual abuse.""

Lyon and H. E. Wood. The respondents were the half-sibling and in-law, respectively, of Annie Carpenter Clarke, the deceased ex-wife of the petitioner and mother of the bound party who had moved to Lancaster County with the children following the divorce in 1901. Judge Holmes granted the petition. The respondents claimed that they were appointed guardians of the bound party and given control of Annie's estate by her request after her death in 1906. They also alleged that the petitioner did not ever financially support his children after the divorce. Additionally, they claimed that he had a violent temper and was addicted to ""intoxicating liquors,"" thus not making him a suitable guardian for his children. After hearing evidence, Judge Holmes denied the writ and ordered that the children remain in custody of Lyon and Wood, but that the petitioner be able to visit them at seasonable times. In the Court's decision, they also mention that the petitioner was currently going through another divorce from his second wife. Clarke then moved for the Court to grant him a new trial, which was overruled. The appearance docket shows that the Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed the Court's decision in 1909.

Malin after it was discovered that he had secretly aided mothers of the Sac and Fox Tribe in taking their children from the American Indian Boarding School at Toledo back to the tribe's reservation. There was a previous trial in this same case which determined that Peters had been wrongfully imprisoned. The judge ruled that Malin's court appointed guardianship of the children whom Peters had taken from the school was not legal, and therefore void. The judge also ruled that the state did not have the right to interfere in the proceedings of the school, because it was a federal institution and its attendees federal wards. Furthermore, the criminal laws of the state did not apply to the Native Americans and their tribes, and would only apply if a member of the tribe was involved in an act which ""brought him within the plane of the legislative jurisdiction of the state."" It was argued that this would apply only in a small number of cases. The ruling of this retrial is unknown.

Katie was around 1.5 years older than Mary and Eddie is around 3 years older than Mary. Their mother had passed away and James was “not so situated as to be able to keep house, or suitably care for his said children.” In December of 1895, James passed away without providing any guardian for the children. He did not leave any means or property of any kind which could be used to provide for the children. He in no way revoked his commitment of the children to the care of petitioner.
Sister Mary Michael (petitioner) was in charge of Saint James’ Orphanage. The children were continuously in the care of petitioner until 11 April 1896. The petitioner was under the assumption that the children did not have any living relatives and were not provided or cared for by any person other than said petitioner. On 11 April 1896, the two older children (Katie and Eddie) were placed in the care of Dennis Kane. The petitioner was not aware that Kane was willing to take more than two of the children. Subsequently, petitioner placed Mary Plunkett in the care of the Costello family where she stayed until December of that year. Petitioner was then informed that Kane was willing and ready to take care of Mary as well, allowing all three children to be raised together. Kane and his wife stated that they would legally adopt all three Plunkett children (giving them rights of inheritance). 
Sister Mary Micheal then went to the Costello family’s home and, with their consent, took Mary back to the aforementioned orphanage. She arranged for Mary’s transportation to the Kane’s home. On 19 December 1896, Mrs. McAdo came to the orphanage and asked for Mary to stay with her and her daughter overnight. The two made an agreement that Mrs. McAdo would bring Mary to the Webster St. Depot on the following day to take the train to the Kane home. On the following day, Mrs. McAdo refused to bring Mary to the train and has, ever since, refused to allow her to go to the Kane’s home or return to the petitioner. 
Petitioner believes that Mrs. McAdo is not suitably situated to have the care and custody of said child. It would be in the best interest of Mary to allow her to be raised with her siblings by Dennis Kane and his wife who are well qualified and suited. 
Sister Mary Michael asks that a Writ of Habeas Corpus be granted so that Mary will be released to the custody of petitioner for the purpose of bringing her to Mr. Kane. Sister Mary Michael signed this petition on 12 January 1897. Judge Baker ordered that the writ be allowed, ordering that Mrs. McAdo come to the Court House with Mary Plunkett at 10:00am on 16 January 1897.
Sheriff McDonald signed a statement that the writ was received on 14 January 1897 and that it would be served to Mrs. McAdo on the same day. In a document filed 2 March 1897, Judge Baker stated that the Court found for Sister Mary Michael, stating that said petitioner was “entitled to the care and custody” of Mary Plunkett and that the best interests of the child would be served by awarding her custody to the petitioner. Albyn L. Frank (District Court Clerk) then filed a motion for the costs to be taxed to Douglas County. This motion was sustained by the Court (Judge Baker) on 9 June 1898.",,"[null, null, ""[\""Plunkett, Mary\""](hc.pers.002319)|Minor|[Application for the Writ of Habeas Corpus for Mary Plunkett](hc.case.ne.0925)"", null, null]",[released from custody],"[null, null, null, null, null]","[null, null, null, null, null]",,,"[None, None, None, None, None]","Frank, Ablyn L.

When Hubbard's lawyers went to the jail and asked what he was incarcerated for, the jailer claimed that he was arrested for vagrancy, but then changed his answer suggesting instead that he was jailed for being a “suspicious character,” which was not an offense of the law. His lawyers claimed that it was common practice for the Omaha police to throw people in jail with the goal of running them out of town. Hubbard was characterized as being a black man who had previously protested against the chief of police for throwing other black people in jail without cause and leaving them there for “indefinite lengths of time.” Therefore Hubbard believed his arrest was retaliation from the Chief.

Sykes fled from the state of Tennessee, arrested in Omaha and was being held for Tennessee authorities

Caleb says that he left Tennessee in January when there was no indictment pending when he left, nor any property delivered into his possession.

(Lincoln, NE)""]","[""Case File""]","Following the removal of the Ponca tribe from their homelands in Nebraska to poor lands in Indian Territory (Oklahoma) and the death of Standing Bear's son, Standing Bear and 29 Ponca left the Oklahoma reservation without the permission of their Indian agent. The group made their way up through Kansas and into Nebraska on foot and stopped at the Omaha Reservation. The Omaha welcomed them as they had long been allies, but orders were issued for the thirty Poncas arrest. A newspaper editor extensively published columns about the proceedings and gathered the two attorneys to make Standing Bear's case. A writ of habeas corpus was issued by Judge Elmer Dundy, and in the trial proceedings, the United States government argued that writs of habeas corpus could only be utilized by citizens of the United States or those considered ""human."" According to this argument, Standing Bear and Indigenous peoples at large were not considered human and therefore should not be able to use writs of habeas corpus to defend themselves in court. Standing Bear's attorneys argued that their clients had cut ties with the Ponca tribe in Oklahoma, had made their intentions known to the Indian agent, that their return to Nebraska was legal and they had not broken any laws. Judge Dundy found for Standing Bear and the group of thirty was to be released. Following the trial, Standing Bear's group was not immediately allowed to return to their homelands as the land had been given to the Lakota nor could they return to the Omaha Reservation for fear of further arrest.

He stated that he planned to return to Ohio within 2-3 weeks and had not left Ohio for the purpose of avoiding arrest. He was arrested 28 August 1899 and had been held for two days without a hearing and had not yet been scheduled for a hearing. Further, he states that he is not guilty of any crime in any jurisdiction. It was reported that he embezzled money from individuals in Ohio but he had not yet been found guilty. The individuals who filed that report were aware that the petitioner was leaving Ohio and intended to visit Omaha, NE. 

A complaint was filed on 11 August 1899 stating that Rose left Cuyahoga County, Ohio on or around 1 August 1899 and was a fugitive of justice for embezzlement. This document was signed by George C. Cockrell, Justice of the Peace. On 31 August 1899, the writ was allowed and Judge Baker wrote to Sheriff McDonald and asked that Rose be released to the custody of the State of Ohio. On 1 September 1899, Rose was ordered to be released from the custody of Douglas County to the custody of the State of Ohio. A supplemental petition was filed on 1 September 1899 stating that the representative of the Governor of Ohio did not have authority and, further, that Rose was not a fugitive from justice per the requisition papers from the State of Ohio and that no affidavit or indictment had been produced by the Governor of Ohio stating that Mr. E. D. Barry had authority to arrest Rose.

First, he was sent to the Oregon State Penitentiary at Salem, Oregon. Then, he was transferred to the custody of C. B. Hopkins at the Federal Penitentiary on McNeil's Island in Puget Sound, Washington. George appealed the decision, and George argued that because he had faced injustice by the hands of the judge. The case initially went to the Supreme Court of Oregon. The judge denied his writ of Habeas Corpus and ruled that a state court did not have the authority to rule in the case. The case was then sent to a US circuit court. George argued that the Supreme Court jurists had judged him as an Indian ward, and not a U.S. citizen who subject to both federal and state law (whereas an Indian ward would have been strictly subject to federal statute), and therefore should have granted his petition and heard the case. This was due to his receipt of an allotment of land by the U.S. government under the Dawes Act, which when accepted, changed his legal status to a U.S. citizen, an no longer an Indian Ward of the United States government. The case went to the United States District Court where the jury convicted him guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. George appealed, and was reportedly tried again, and was once more convicted of murder. The archives lack these documents, but the case is referenced in this case, no. 1390, in Judge Hanford’s denial and dismissal of George’s petition for wrongful imprisonment by Charles E. Hopkins at the US Penitentiary at McNeil Island. George appealed a fourth time and was dismissed.

Han Lee previously bought Seo Kim in China and believed that he was losing his property. Ah Chow denied that he was detaining Seo Kim. When ordered by the court to bring her in, he claimed that he had never held her captive nor had he any intent on selling her across the border. Even after a court order was issued, he refused to appear before Judge Orange Jacobs. The sheriff, H.G. Thornton was ordered to arrest and bring Seo Kim into custody. He brought her in but was not able to bring Ah Chow in at that time.

Elnora had been living with her mother and Moses' wife, Ella Cline, in Seattle since April 15, 1887. Moses claimed that as a single mother, Ella would be unable to maintain the best interest of Elnora and that as a caring and capable father he not only possessed a legal right to custody of his child, but that Elnora would benefit from being in his custody. In response, Ella maintained that she had a legal right to custody of Elnora and that Elnora's age required the care of her mother. While the remaining files for the case are missing following Ella's return to the writ, Elnora seems to have gone into Moses' custody for a brief period, given that Moses listed Elnora as the sole other member of his household on the 1889 Kitsap County Census.

He states that he is not a fugitive from justice but was visiting relatives in Omaha and had not left Ohio for the purpose of avoiding arrest. This file offers a restatement of the facts from the prior file; Rose was arrested wrongly, he was held without trial and no news of a trial being scheduled, he claims to have not committed any crime in Ohio and, thus, cannot be a fugitive from the law.

The form from the Justice of the Peace (George C. Cockrell) states that a complaint was submitted by Deputy Sheriff Louis Grebe on 31 August 1899 stating that on or about 1 August 1899, Rose was a fugitive from justice from Common Court in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Deputy Grebe claims that Rose stood accused of the crime of embezzlement (a sum of $300), committed in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. 

George C. Cockrell (Justice of the Peace) signed an order on 1 September 1899 to the Keeper of the Common Jail to keep Angelo Rose for “further examination,” as he had been charged with committing the offence of Fugitive from Justice. An order that the Sheriff release Rose to allow him to appear in court on 1 September 1899 was submitted on 31 August 1899 by Coblyn L. Frank (Clerk). 

Judge B. S. Baker ordered that Rose’s writ be allowed and ordered that a writ of habeas corpus be issued in favor of Angelo Rose, returnable on 1 September 1899 at 2:00pm directed to Sheriff John McDonald.

Decker petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that he was unlawfully detained by Sheriff Nicholas Ress. Judge Holmes granted the petition and allowed him bail at the sum of 300 dollars. Decker had been arrested on the charge of perjury after he falsely claimed during a divorce trial that he was a resident of Lancaster County, Nebraska. After hearing evidence, Judge Holmes ruled that Decker had not committed perjury and therefore was being illegally detained. He ordered that Decker be released from custody. However, he ordered that the County Attorney, James L. Caldwell, prosecute Decker for the charge of contempt of court and punish him accordingly. Caldwell immediately followed through in State of Nebraska vs John F. Decker where again Decker was released on bail. The outcome of this case is unknown. Weeks later, Caldwell produced a motion for a re-hearing and a new trial for Decker's habeas corpus case, which the court overruled. In 1906, Caldwell's appeal was tried in the Nebraska Supreme Court, who later dismissed his petition in error.",1.0,"[""[\""Decker, John F.\""](hc.pers.001422)|Adult|[\""In re Application of John F.

The Keevans further argued that they were financially and mentally capable of providing Mary with a moral education and superior material means.

At some point, Leona returned to her mother while Naomi remained with her father. When Joseph died in February 1898, a pair of brothers named Charles and George Shafer contrived to have custody of Naomi awarded to Charles, arguing that she had no relatives living in the state. Flora petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve Naomi, which was granted. Flora argued that she was Naomi's rightful guardian and that Charles ""only desires the custody of said minor child to gratify his own licentious designs and to accommodate the lust of his single brother George."" Charles countered that Flora was an abusive mother, that Naomi remained with the Shafers of her own volition, and that the District Court of Lancaster County, Nebraska had no jurisdiction over Red Willow County.

Police Judge Gordon issued a mittimus, stating that this 30 day sentence had been imposed at an earlier date but was suspended based on the condition that Compton leave the city and not return. The initial sentence had been imposed on 6 December 1897. The Police Judge asserts that he failed to comply with these terms; leading to his arrest in Omaha on the charge of vagrancy, and was placed in the County Jail to complete his initial sentence. On 21 April 1898, a writ for the offense of vagrancy was submitted by Police Judge Gordon and signed by Sheriff McDonald and Deputy Sheriff Lewis detailing these claims. 
The case was heard by the District Court (Judge Slabaugh) on 6 May 1898. During this trial, Judge Slabaugh determined that no offense had been committed, that Compton was unlawfully being deprived of his liberty, and that Sheriff McDonald should release him from custody. On 7 May 1898, Judge Slabaugh signed an Order to Discharge the Prisoner on Writ of Habeas Corpus.

When he did not pay the fine, Hull was placed in the custody of the King County Sherriff at the King County Jail. Hull filed a writ of habeas corpus arguing that he should be entitled to bail and was being illegally kept without a set bail. Judge Greene granted the writ and set a bail amount of $500 to go into effect on July 1, 1884, the first day of the Supreme Court of Washington Territory's new session. In Olympia, WA, he could be let out of jail before the territorial Supreme Court with a payment of $500. Hull's fate following the April 25, 1884 ruling is unknown.

On January 6, 1886, Barnes and his lawyers filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to Judge Roger S.

Greene granted the petition and the writ of Habeas Corpus was filed, however, the case files following the writ are missing.

The defendants argued that Can-ah-couqua had signed an agreement with the school in 1883-when her son was five years old- to relinquish her parental custody for a period of five years. They argued that it was for the well being and education of the boy, Con-ca-bach, that he remain in the school and not be allowed to return to his ""uncivilized"" mother. Can-ah-couqua argued that she had never been presented any sort of contract or verbally agreed to give- up custody of her son to the school. She further asserted that Con-ca-dach was suffering physically from the poor conditions of the school building, overworked, and unfed. He was also frequent physically and verbally abused by teachers and other staff members of the school. Furthermore, she had not been able to see her son in three years, since he had been taken from her. As part of the petitioner's evidence, Can-ah-couqua;'s attorney submitted a letter that had been written by Con-ca-dach to the governor of Alaska, A. P. Swineford, saying that he wished to be taken out of the school, and returned to his mother. Judge Dawson ruled in favor of the defendants, writing that Can-ah-couqua had relinquished custody for five years in her ""agreement"" with the school, and it was in the best interest of the child to continue to receive a proper education. Can-ah-couqua was, however, allowed to occasionally visit Con-ca-dach at the school, provided that the there was adequate supervisor by school officials.

She and her sister initially immigrated to New York in October of 1916, where they worked as housekeepers. They then head to Chicago where they find work in bindery for the newly formed Industrial Workers of the World.​​ In October 1918 the Roy sisters moved to Seattle, Washington despite investigation into their ties to the IWW. The are arrested shortly after. The sisters are held in custody by Henry M. White, the sheriff and US Commissioner of immigration for Seattle. The case is heard by judge Jeremiah Neterer in the US District Court for Washington. While temporarily out on bond and while awaiting deportation, Janet marries Ian Valentine Mackay, a fellow Scottish immigrant who believes he is a naturalized citizen. The court dismissed his claim of citizenship and the marriage did not certify Janet a citizen who cannot be deported. Mackay's attorney repeatedly asks about the fairness of the case-in part because of the relationship between Judge Neterer and defendant White.

Bell appeared in court on 4 April 1898 and Judge Slambaugh signed an order releasing him on that same day stating, “it is therefore ordered that said Henry Bell be discharged from the custody of John McDonald Sheriff and from said unlawful detention.""

Shortly thereafter, Menard gave Aspasia to his daughter and son-in-law, Bernice and Francois Chouteau, who brought her to St. Louis. Late in 1827, Aspasia petitioned for the right to sue as a poor person and to have her freedom determined by the court. She charged Francois Chouteau and Pierre Menard with assault, battery, and false imprisonment and asked for $1,000 in damages.

Austin. Taik's mother was said to have died around March 1885, and one Anna Vine became the parent- appointed guardian of the child. The story was that after the death of Hitch- sah- See, Taik's mother, Vine came in March 1885 to take Taik from the school to her home in Victoria, British Columbia, the school administrators, including Jackson and Austin refused to grant the release. When her complaints for release went unanswered, Hitch- sah- See filed for a writ of habeas corpus with her husband, Don- ah- Clah, against Jackson, Austin, and a woman referred to as ""Mrs. McFarland."" After the case was filed it was discovered that Taik's mother had not actually died, but was still alive, as was her father, Don-ah-clah. The case was transferred to them, and they became the new petitioners. The defendants argued that they had made a verbal agreement to enroll Taik for a period of 5 years in the school with her parents. With this alleged verbal agreement, the defendants claimed to be the legal guardians of Taik.  Judge Ward McAllister ruled against the defendant, in favor of Hitch- sah- see and Don-ah-clah. He wrote that the school officials had no authority to make ""contracts with Indians"" under the provisions of the federal government. Additionally, administrators could not take Native children from their parents, and were required to return them if that's what parents wished.

The Helmses did not formally adopt Harry and Herbert, whom they put to work in their traveling minstrel show. After hearing the evidence, Harry and Herbert were released back into the custody of the Home for the Friendless. The judge ordered that Samuel could retrieve his children once he demonstrated that he could properly care for them and after he paid off his debt to the state.
