<p>Gahres</p>
<p>v</p>
<p>Barett</p>

<p>Habeas Corpus:</p>

<p>The complaint herein 1 alleges that: Plaintiff is mother of a minor child by former huband and is the natural and lawful Guardian therof and entitled to the custody of said child.</p>

<p>2 That she obtained a decree of divorce in the circuit court of Oregon from her former husband in 1869. Whereby the custody of the child was awarded her. </p>

<p>3 That the child is within the jurisdiction of this court </p>

<p>4 That since decree she was lawfully <unclear/> with Gahres </p>

<p>5 That she and her husband have ample means of supporting  and schooling the child </p>

<p>6 That she is in custody of defendants and that her education is neglected and that Defendants wrongfully retain custody of said child. 

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.027.002"/>

the defendant in obedience of the writ issued <unclear>correct</unclear> with <unclear>court</unclear> with the child who is of the age of 7 yrs. and pleads that this matter is readjudicated &#8212; issue is <unclear>taken tressure</unclear> and it appears from the <unclear>screening</unclear> of this court <unclear>setting</unclear> of Chambers That.</p>

<p>June 30 1871 Plffs filed in this court a petition against defats for a writ for the child in question. <unclear>seeking out</unclear></p>

<p>1 That they are legal parents and named guardians of child in question. </p>

<p>2 That in 1869 the marriage was dissolved and child given to Pltt by the Circuit Court of Oregon and that since divorce Plff has <unclear>submitted</unclear></p>

<p>3 That the child is <unclear>unlawfully</unclear> detained by defendants and that Plaitiffs are entiltled to the custody of 

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.027.003"/>

the child.</p>

<p>The answer made issue as to these <del>to</del> allegations and <unclear>preseeding</unclear> others.</p>

<p>The cause was heard before the Judge of this court who <unclear>remandered</unclear> the child to the custody of Defendants.</p>

<p>I filed the transcript of decree of divorce on the files as Evidence on the trial of this cause.</p>

<p>Looking at the whole record I am satisfied that the same issues are presented to this court.  That were presented and determined before his Honor Judge <unclear>Bruredy </unclear>. Are of which the <unclear>pressure</unclear>upon. and while the Judges may from time to time be <unclear></unclear> this court is at all times the source. </p>

<p>In the case of the Teritory <unclear>this</unclear> Matter decided at December term 1873 the supreme court says</p>

<p><unclear>It were</unclear> better

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.027.004"/>

that we follow the settled adjudications of the court whatever charges be made in the <unclear>members</unclear> thereof</p>

<p><del>Were</del></p>

<p>In order to settle a matter rejudicated there must be a concurrence of four conditions to wit</p>
<p>1 Identity in the <unclear/> <unclear>source</unclear> for </p>
<p>2 Identity of the cause of action </p>
<p>3 Identity of persons and parties </p>
<p>4 Identity of the quality in the persons for or against where the claim is made. </p>

<p><unclear>Bound for</unclear> <unclear/> <unclear>rrs Jurisdiction</unclear> But in the case of Habeas Corpus is this former order adjudication a for to this proceeding</p>

<p>It is said in <unclear/> on Habeaus Corpus That the only has no where been adjudged Res adjudicated Exept for so long as the <unclear>maternal excuses Sterias</unclear> existing of the home of

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.027.005"/>

the order remains unchanged</p>

<p><unclear/> H.Corpus 463 </p>

<p>In the <unclear/> is the people it was held. That an adjudication of a writ of record or of an effect having authority to act in the matter. on the question of the custody of one <unclear>infant</unclear> child. brought up on Habeas Corpus. May be pleaded res adjudication and is <unclear>evidence</unclear> upon the same parties . in all future <unclear>authorities restoring</unclear> to the same mother. and upon the same state of funds. </p>

<p>25 March 63 Paige <unclear>Section</unclear> says in his opinion in that case </p>

<p>The former preceedings were a for to any remanderings how of any matter which occured before his first order of a first adjudication on Habeas Corpus or <unclear>nober</unclear> the <unclear/> writ be <unclear>able</unclear> such <unclear/> controversies may endure until the enters <unclear/>

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.027.006"/>

or the death of the parties. Under further continuance <unclear>impracticable</unclear> and his  <unclear>favore</unclear> writ of liberty <del>will</del> will become an enquire of oppression </p>
<p>25 March of page 99</p>

<p>This case was decided by the court of <unclear>Eners </unclear> in 1840. in 1842 the case <del>as</del> was again before Supreme Court. in the case issued by counsel. in 3 All 399 and the court further as they are bound to the decision in 25 <unclear>meredery</unclear> holding judgement on Habeas Corpus a <unclear/> as to funds existing on the <unclear/> of the judgement. </p>

<p>In the case in 25 March of page 94 the <unclear> Chancellor </unclear> says</p>

<p>The <del>proceeding on Habeas Corpus</del> principle of res adjudication is applicable to proceedings on Habeas Corpus and that it now make no difference 

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.027.007"/>

in the application <del>that the</del> whether the writ was returnable before a court or Judge. for in neither case ought the party to be prosecuted to proceed <del></del> adjudication before the same court or officer. to <unclear/> the former decision while the <unclear/> remained the same.</p>

<p>A different view of the law is taken in 2 <unclear></unclear> 429. holding the doctrine such applicable on habeas corpus</p>

<p>but the court in that case say on page 430.</p>

<p>"<unclear>How</unclear> for judges will go in <unclear>that</unclear> execution after a case has once been determined is a question which must rest in that <unclear>over forms</unclear> judgment</p>

<p>I am <unclear>endured</unclear> to think that <unclear>that vote the recurse</unclear> reasonable and at all made. I think the result would be evil. Were I to reverse a decision made by a former Judge of this court which is clearly res adjudication.

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.027.008"/>

if new facts or issues are prescribed the case is exactly the same in all aspects.</p>

<p>I am of opinion also that on Habeas Corpus in a case with the facts as in this case <unclear>of law</unclear>  The judge can only determine who is legally entitled to the custody of this child</p>

<p>That is on wherin thus the law. bestowed the child</p>

<p>True as counsel say where a court renders a decree of divorce that court may force time to time change its <unclear/> <unclear/> as the facts may <unclear/> but no such charge has been made in fact as the child is without the jurisdiction of the Oregon Courts. it is <unclear/> <unclear/> any order of that court would be of any validity but it is not now necessary to determine the

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.027.009"/>

I am of opinion also that this court has no original jurisdiction in matters of guardianship. that is conferred on the court of Probate which has ample power to appoint and remove guardians for any and all minors within the Territory on a proper case made and from such orders are <unclear>opposed</unclear> to this court. </p>

<p><unclear>Truothly</unclear></p>

<p><unclear></unclear> 617 of our statute declares that no ward or Judge shall require <unclear>with the legality</unclear> any judgement or process whereby a party is in custody upon any process issued on any prior judgement of a court of <unclear>lawprotent</unclear> jurisdiction </p>

<p>and <unclear></unclear> 628 applies this provision to suits relative to minors</p>

<p>We have seen that the judge in Habeas Corpus has the process of a court</p>

<p>Wherefore looking 

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.027.010"/>

at the whole case I am of opinion that the judgement of his Honor Judge Kennedy awarding the child to the defendants is a <unclear>for</unclear> to this proceeding </p>

<p>The plea is therefore sufficient and the writ will be dismissed</p>
