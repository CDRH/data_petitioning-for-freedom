<p>The Petition of

lawfully married to her in the City and 
County of St Louis on the 8th day of June 
1865. That the said Rosa has since 
the 6th day of September 1865 and now is 
unlawfully detained and kept in custody 
by George Wolbrecht at his dwelling 
on the north east corner of Fourth and 
Elm Streets in the city of S Louis in 
said county</p>
<p>Your petitioner 
further states that the said Rosa on 
or about the said <del/> sixth day of
Sept. 1865. was induced <del/> as your  
petitioner believes by certain false &amp; unfounded statements of said Wolbrecht &amp; 
members of his family and by the use of 
improper means and <del/> artifices on their 
part, to desert the house of your petitioner 
and was <unclear>invighted</unclear> by them into the house 
of said Wolbrecht where she has ever since 
been and now is being there unlawfully 



detained <del>by</del> as aforesaid that your  
petitioner though he has applied at said 
house and to the persons in charge thereof 
for an interview with his said wife was 
denied access to her presence and was 
forcibly prevented from seeing her.</p>
<p>Your petitioner 
further states that the detention &amp; restraint 
of said Rosa is illegal in this that your 
petitioner being the lawful husband 
of said Rosa is legally entitled to the 
<unclear>society</unclear> care &amp; custody of his said wife 
&amp; that said Wolbrecht has no legal right 
to the custody of said Rosa &amp; <unclear/> 
to detain her from your petitioner or to 
restrain her of her liberty.</p>
<p>Your petitioner there
fore prays Your Honor to issue a writ of 
Habeas Corpus directed to said George

body of the said Rosa Teusel so detained by him before you at such time 
&amp; place as may be named to do &amp; receive 
what shall then &amp; there be considered 
concerning the premises and that if 
on a hearing on the return of this writ it shall 
appear that your petitioner said Rosa Teusel is unlawfully detained 
from your petitioner by said George 
Wolbrecht &amp; is restrained of her liberty 
that she be discharged from such restraint &amp; detention.</p>
