<p>And now come <unclear>Sistend S. Hillson, Merchant. Charles H. Jackson, Merchant<unclear/> Pastor Presby Church, Joseph H. Baker <unclear/> Bozeman <unclear/> Real Estate <unclear/></unclear> <!--Signed-->and being severally duly sworn, upon their corporal oath, doth depose and say, each for himself, and not one for another, that he is and has been for more than ten years last past a resident of Boseman, Gallstin County, Montana. That he knows the Chinaman Tom Sing and his wife Na Lay, who, during a large portion of said period of time have resided in said Boseman; that when they first came to Boseman, they were reputed to be husband and wife, and lived and cohabited together as such. That after residing in said City some time, they adopted the habits of western civilization as to dress, abandoned the religion generally believed and practised by theire countrymen, and became members in good standing of the Presbyterian Church, which membership they now maintain. That they are persons of exceptional intelligence and propriety of demeanor, the Mother speaking the English language with a fluency and propriety equal to that of almost any native born American. That when they joined said church, in confirmation of their status of husband and wife, they were married according to the form sof the Presbyterian Church, having, as it was reputed, been theretofore married in the Empire of China. That the said Tom Sing is a credible witness, whose reputation for truth and veracity entitles him to be believed.</p>
<p>That his statement, with that of his said wife, as to the place and circumstances of the birth of said Ham Hung Wah, <unclear>conports</unclear> with what we know of it by reputation, and we believe teh same to be true, and that if an opportunity shall be afforded to take the testimony of producable witnesses, anad have it examined judicially, it will be made to appear that the said Ham Hung Wah was born in Montana, subject to the jurisdiction of, and a citizen of the United Statesw, and that in the matter of the attempted entry of him the said Ham Hung Wah, no attempt is being made to impose upon the authorities or to obtain an unlawful entry of a Chinese person within the United States.</p>
<p>And further affiants say not.</p>
