To the Honorable Frank Allyn, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and Judge of the 2d. District, W.T</p>
      <p class="tei_p">
The petetion of Gus Bendjus, Robert Stranglauet, Ben Fredricson, Frank Nelso, Andrue Johnson, Leander Brown, John Thompson,
Alex Green and Thomas Jacobs, respectfully show to your Honor that they and each of them are now prisoners, confined in the custody of
William Billings, Sheriff of Thurston County, in the County jail at Olympia Washington Territory and within the second judicial district, for a supposed
criminal offense, to wit: Riot and also Malicious Mischief. And your petetioners also show that such confinment is by virtue of certain Warrants issued 
from the District court holding terms at Montesano, directed to the Sheriff of Chehalis County, upon certain alleged indictments which were found by
a Grand Jury of said Chehalis County at its Sept, seession 1887, and it is further shown that petetioners were never held to answer to said Grand
Jury, and that they were arrested upon said Warrants by said Sheriff of Chehalis County on the 17th. day of September 1887, and were by reason
of the court adjourning on the 16th. of said Month, not permitted to have a speedy trial as guaranteed by the law. That said alleged Indictments were
or are marked filed in said court by the clerk thereof on the 15th. day of Sept. 1887. That by reason of the foregoing, they have not been arrainged, 
and that they have had no oportunyty to be heard in any manner whatever, respecting the validity of said indictments or the irregularity of the manner
in which they were found by said Grand Jury. And we further show your Honor that none of the indictments
<span class="hr"> </span>

upon which said Warrants are said to have issued, are valid in law, but that the same are insufficent to rightfully deprive petetioners of their liberty,
and are void for the following reasons to wit:-</p>
      <p class="tei_p">1. They are not signed by the "foreman of the Grand-Jury".</p>
      <p class="tei_p">2.- The names of all witnesses examined before said Grand Jury are not endorsed thereon.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">3.- That they were not presented <del>of</del> marked filed as required by law.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">4.- That said Grand Jury was not selected, drawn, summoned, empannelled or sworn as the law directs</p>
      <p class="tei_p">5.- That each of said indictments fail to state facts sufficent to constitue any offense under our law, and that 
each of said indictments does not state any offense against thes petetioners.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">6.- That none of them comply with the requirements of the Code.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">
And your petetioners aver that they nor none of them are confined or committed by virtue of anyother process, than that as herein before set forth, and that
they are unable to get a copy of the Warrants upon which they were arrested and are now held. And your petetioners are informed by their counsel, that 
said imprisonment is illegal, and that said illegality consists in the particulars as above setforth oppostie the figures from 1 to 6 inclusive on this page.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">
Wherefore your petetioners pray that a Writ of Habeas corpus issue here in, to the end that they may be discharged from custody, and for such other order as may be just.</p>
