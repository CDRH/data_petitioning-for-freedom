      <p class="tei_p">To the Hon Law Commissioner Court</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner Frank W <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Burk[?]</span> respectfully shows to your Honor 
that one John Bellamy a free man 
of color is detained in custody 
&amp; illegally restrained of his liberty
by one <del>Corbin Thompson</del> R.F. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Logan[?]</span> Jailor of St Louis County 
in &amp;  <del>upon the premises of said Thompson</del> 
on sixth street between Market &amp; <del>Wal</del> 
Chessnut streets in the City of St Louis. That 
said <del>Thompson</del> Jailor holds said John 
Bellamy, alleging he is a runaway slave. That said restraint 
is illegal in as much as said 
John is and has always been 
free. Your petitioner further states 
he has made no other 
application for a writ of Habeas 
Corpus in this cause. He therefore 
prays your Honor to issue your 
writ of Habeas Corpus commanding said <del>Thompson</del> jailor to bring the 
body of said John before your 
Honor at such time and place 
as your honor may direct to do and

receive what may then &amp; there be 
ordered, and as in duly bound 
your petitioner &amp;</p>

this 30th day of June 1858,</p>
