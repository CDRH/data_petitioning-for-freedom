LEWIS FOR PRESIDENT

Seattle has a full-fledged James Hamilton Lewis for President club.

Just how much of a figure will Lewis cut at the national convention? Were it almost anybody else the answer would be easy. Illinois would cast its 38 votes for him for a while, and then he would drop out of sight. But the career of James Hamilton Lewis has been phenomenal. He has landed before when his case seemed hopeless. He is one of the mose unique figures in public life.

Few Democrats are really satisfied with any of the aspirants. Many have gone to Roosevelt not because they wanted him, but because there was no other candidate in sight who appeared to have strength enough to make the grade. The governor of New York is the bandwagon candidate. With that condition anything may happen, and many believe that something startling will really occur.

William Jennings Bryan won his first nomination for the presidency by his eloquence. He had nothing else. Before his death many come to the conclusion that he was not overly intelligent. James Hamilton Lewis is at least equally as eloquent. Nobody had ever denied that he has brains. Added to this, he is already a national character. Bryan was practically unknown.
