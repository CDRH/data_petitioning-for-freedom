    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Blanche Powers was the wife of Walter Powers, a man who had been arrested on April 20th, 1920, for allegedly committing grand larceny in Kansas and being a fugitive from justice. Mrs. Powers filed a petition for Habeas Corpus, claiming that her husband had been arrested without any pretense as no affidavit had been filed against him, and he was charged with no evidence for his crime. She also cited her inability to provide for herself and that her husband's restraint placed her in dire need. Her petition was granted, and the judge was set to hear her case on April 27th, 1920. Unfortunately, no documents were filed that reveal the petition's final outcome. </li>
