    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Ray Rickard petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve his daughter, Dorothy Rickard, from the custody of Catherine Kleeman and Martha Peer, which was granted. Martha responded that although her mother, Catherine, had Dorothy, who was her granddaughter, in her possession, neither woman claimed custody of the girl. Margaret had apparently left Dorothy with her mother on June 7, 1915. Apparently, Ray and Catherine made up over the month of June, since Catherine was apparently living with Ray in Kansas when he filed the petition.  After hearing the evidence, the judge ordered that Catherine either deliver Dorothy to her father or demonstrate in court why she should not have to do so. A few months later, Ray withdrew his petition, suggesting he had secured custody of Dorothy.  This is confirmed by the 1930 census, which shows that Margaret and Ray were still together with Dorothy in their custody. </li>
