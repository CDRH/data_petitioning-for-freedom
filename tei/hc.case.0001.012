it was <unclear>considerably</unclear> bloody on the side from 6 to 8 inches   Near one edge in patches as though forced in to the <unclear></unclear> about 1 in wide and four long and <unclear></unclear> the other side some blood did not notice anything but blood in it one spot blood <unclear></unclear> say 1/2 <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> in would make it <unclear></unclear>  other smaller <unclear></unclear> me <unclear></unclear> the door step - could not tell around how long there from appearance could not have been there near set <unclear></unclear> was there next morning <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> as night before deceased had <unclear></unclear> been <unclear>dest</unclear> red and brown <unclear></unclear> blood spots there. <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> John Haynes and Rudolph Staltz I think was there <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> was there - I was ordered to make an <unclear>examine</unclear> by <unclear></unclear>  Done to - the coroner and I was <unclear>engadgec</unclear> together the both took hold of him and rolled him over on his back then we <unclear></unclear> to get clothes I got <unclear></unclear> and coroner cut the clothing in front and stripped him <unclear></unclear> <del></del> <unclear>In</unclear> was a mark about two inches below the left nipple ran <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> from bruise simply destroying the testicle <unclear>seeds</unclear> as I have seen frequently made by a spear bullet say 3/4 of <unclear>in</unclear> such of a <unclear></unclear> and <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> color  I did not examine the clothing there was another mark about <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> of the other in the <unclear>shoulder</unclear> just below the collar bone about <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> I examined his mouth and throat on the throat large patches of blood <unclear></unclear> the skin <unclear></unclear> about half way in color dark similar to clodded blood just such marks as in often seen on dead people when blood settles under the skin   skin was not apparently <unclear></unclear> Next mark left ear <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> and immediately above and to <unclear></unclear> a scalp could scalp cut through as by a knife about 3/4 inch long <del></del>  could cut it for the day two inches each way and I examined it show <unclear></unclear> - says looks just like the one <unclear></unclear> stitch - that is the stitch did not <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> immediately under the wound cut by coroner no other <unclear></unclear> mark of violence scalp cut no other way  skull <unclear>above</unclear> and back of this wound was and the whole skull <unclear>above</unclear> this mark was all broken and the other side was worse broken than the side above the cut - simply pronounced it comminuted which means broken

a little peices to remove to <unclear></unclear> they might be <unclear></unclear> - one thing <unclear></unclear> right side of the head had no scalp hand was <unclear>undeniably</unclear> the <unclear>dep</unclear> <unclear>should</unclear> <unclear></unclear> to 1/2 or 3/4 inch <unclear></unclear> and  was badly <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear>  shown pronounced cause of feath Frank Teller produced by blows on the head with some blunt instrument - the blows on either side of the head would produce death - should say that death ensured <unclear>confidently</unclear> death would be from concussions of the <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> in the head would not produce death one in <unclear></unclear> nearly <unclear></unclear></p>

<p>When I saw deceased <unclear></unclear> in Spokane County about a mile and half in Washington Territory - I do not know whether defendant had occupied the house <unclear></unclear> up to the time of the killing or not</p>
X
<p>Each wound near the head on the shoulder could <unclear></unclear> been made by <unclear></unclear> by <unclear></unclear> - the wound on the left side of head could have been produced by corner of the board  There might be concussion of the  <unclear></unclear> without <unclear></unclear> of the skull  I dont think there might in a <unclear></unclear> on one side of the skull which  <unclear>slows</unclear> <unclear></unclear> one side</p>
X
<p><unclear>Mutilated</unclear> of left ear would probably have been made at time cut <unclear></unclear> made - did not observe wound on right side of neck blood had settled but no <unclear>abrussion</unclear> of the <unclear></unclear> by witness was wound on left <unclear>head</unclear> first fingers broken - no <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> of violence (sculp around) on right side thick blows might be  <unclear></unclear> if broken and comminuted <unclear>produce</unclear> and skull <unclear></unclear> <del></del> no <unclear></unclear> of sculp moved </p>

<p><unclear>Name</unclear> I do not think <unclear>comminuted</unclear> could be produced by one blow on left  side on right side it might have been produced by one single blow <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> club</p>


<p>Re X</p>
<p><unclear>arrange</unclear> thickness human skull rau and for 1/8 to 1/2 inch  3/8 inch would be the <unclear></unclear> the <unclear></unclear> according <unclear></unclear> - thickness of skull does vary in <unclear>measurements</unclear></p>
