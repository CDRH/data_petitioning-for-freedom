commits said Anthony Han to the <add>said</add> county
jail for six months upon the sentence
of said Justice upon a trial before said
Justice of said Anthony Han when a 
<pb></pb>
charge of petit lancery, the said Justice
having sentenced said Anthony Han to
six months imprisonment <del>of</del> as a
punishment for said allegded petit
lancery, which sentence, commitment, 
and all the proceedings thereafter are 
illegal and said because the said
Justice had no jurisdistiction to pronounce
such sentence and <add>no</add> authority
or jurisdiction to enforce the same. </p>
<p>Wherefore your petition complaint
prays that a Writ of Habeas 
Corpus may be granted directed
to the said L.V. Wycroff, sheriff
as aforsaid, commanding him to 
have the body of said Anthony Han 
before at a time and place
therein to be specified to do and recieve
what shall then and there be considered
by your Honor concerning said Anthony
Han together witht the time and
course of His detention and said this
and that he the said Han may be restrained 
to his liberty. </p>
