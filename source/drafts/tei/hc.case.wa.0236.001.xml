and the Secretary of Labor of the United States upon appeal,
have adjudged the petitioner to be a contract laborer and
to be seeking entry into the united States in violation of
the Act of Congress in reference to contract laborers; that it
appears in and by the record of this petitioner's examination
in the Immigration office, that he is a clerk and not a laborer, 
and that in order that the cause of this petitioner's detention
mat be fully inquired into and adjudged, it is necessary that
the record made by the Immigration office at Seattle be re-
turned into this court, together with the testimony taken 
upon the examination of this petitioner.</p> 
<p>WHEREFORE, your petitioner prays that a writ of habeas
corpus may issue directed to the said Henry M. White, Commiss-</p> 
<pb></pb> 
<p>inoer of Immigration of the United States at Seattle, command-
ing him that he do produce the body of your petitioner before
