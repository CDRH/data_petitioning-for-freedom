That on the first January 1831 she was by him 
sold to Dr Noah S. Webb of the same State of 
Mississippi whose property she continued 
until his death in the year 1841 when she 
was emancipated by the will of said Webb 
and has been free ever since.</p>

and imprisoned prays that a writ of Habeas 
Corpus may <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> directed to the said John
