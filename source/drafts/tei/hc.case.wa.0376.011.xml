<p>NORTHERN DIVISION</p>

<p>No. 6617</p>

<p>RETURN</p>

<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION 
OF JUNICHI YAMAMOTO
FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS</p>

<p>To the Honorable JEREMIAH NETERER, Judge of the District Court
of the United States
for the Western District of Washington:</p>

<p>Now comes the respondent, Luther Weedin, United States
Commissioner of Immigration for the District of Washington, with
his office at the port of Seattle, Washington, and for answer
and return to the order to show cause herein requiring the said
respondent to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus should not
be granted herein, says that he here produces the body of
JUNICHI YAMAMOTO, the person named in the petition for said
writ and said order, in obedience to the command and direction
of the said order to show cause;</p>

<p>And for further answer and return to said order avers
that he is detaining in his custody the said JUNICHI YAMAMOTO
for deportation from the United States as an alien Japanese
person not entitled to admission under the laws of the United
States and subject to deportation under the laws of the United 
States, the said JUNICHI YAMAMOTO having been heretofore
arrested and detained by this respondent under a warrant of
arrest issued by the Secretary of Labor of the United States,
and thereafter having been ordered deported by said Secretary
of Labor; said order to this respondent being in the form of a</p>

<p>1</p>

<pb/>

<p>warrant of deportation dated February 25, 1922, said warrant of
deportation being in the words and figures following, to wit:</p>

<p>"WARRANT - DEPORTATION OF ALIEN</p>

<p>Bureau of
Immigration</p>
<p>Form &amp; B</p>

<p>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>
<p>Department of Labor</p>
<p>WASHINGTON</p>

<p>No. 55221/6</p>

<p>TO COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, Seattle, Wash., 
Or the any Officer or Employee of the U.S.Immigration
Service.</p>

<p>WHEREAS, from proofs submitted to me, after due hearing
before Immigrant Inspector Arthur J. Kahl, held at Seattle,
Wash., I have become satisfied that the alien JUNICHI
YAMAMOTO, alias JUNICHI HIROSHI, who landed at the port of
Seattle, Wash., ex SS "Taiyo Maru", on the 9th day of
September, 1917, has been found in the United States in
violation of the immigration act of February 5, 1917, to
wit:</p>

<p>That he entered in violation of rule 11 of the
immigration rules; and that he was a person likely to
become a public charge at the time of his entry,</p>

<p>and may be deported in accordance therewith:</p>

<p>I, E.J.HENNING, Assistant Secretary of Labor, by virtue 
of the power and authority vested in me by the laws of the
United States, do hereby command you to return the said
alien to Japan the country whence he came, at the expense
of the appropriation: "Expenses of Regulating Immigration,
1922". You are directed to purchase transportation for the
alien from Seattle, Wash., to his home in Japan at the
lowest available rate, payable from the above-named appro-
priation. Execution of this warrant will serve to cancel
the bond furnished in his behalf.</p>

<p>For so doing, this shall be your sufficient warrant.</p>

<p>Witness my hand and seal this 25th day of February 1922.</p>

<p>E. J. HENNING</p>

<p>Assistant Secretary of Labor."</p>

<p>Respondent hereto attaches the original record,
order, decision and exhibits, both on the hearing before the
Immigrant Inspector at Seattle, Washington,and the record of
the submission of said hearing to the Secretary of Labor,
which papers are hereby made a part and parcel of this return
the same as if copied herein in full.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE respondent prays that said writ of habeas
corpus be denied.</p>

and says: That he is United States Commissioner of Immigration,
named in the foregoing return; that he has read the said return
and knows the contents thereof, and that he believes the same to 
be true.</p>
