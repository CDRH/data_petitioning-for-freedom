<p>In the District Court of Columbia County Washington
Territory holding terms at Dayton</p>

<p>In the matter of the application of

<p>That at and during all the times herein after mentioned
he was and now is the duly acting and qualified Sheriff
of Columbia County Washington Territory and by virtue
of said office is the keeper of the County jail of said
County</p>

<p>That on the 9th day of May 1888 the aforesaid S.M
McFarland was duly brought before W H Kuhn
one of the Justices of the Peace in and for said Columbia
County Washington Territory upon the sworn complaint
of M Cross charging that the said S.M. McFarland
on the 24th day of April AD 1888 within said County and
Territory unlawfully did remove from the County of
Columbia in said Territory into the Counties of Whitman
and Lincoln therein certain personal property
towit: One brown mule about seven years old
One brown mule about seven years old One set of
team harness and one 3 1/2 inch Steel Skein Barn
Wagon which said personal property he the
said S.M. McFarland had therefore towit on May 10th
1886 duly mortgaged by a certain chattel mortgage
beginning date on that day to M Cross to secure
the payment of a certain promissory note therein
set forth which said property was at the date
of said mortgage situated in said Columbia

<pb/>

County Washington Territory and that said mortgage
had not been released and said property was
so removed without the consent in writing or
otherwise of said mortgage M Cross,
and that on the examination of said complaint
the said Justice of the Peace then and
there found that the said offence had been
committed and that there was probable cause
for charging the <del>defend</del> said SM McFarland
with the same. Whereupon it was then and
there ordered by said Justice of the Peace
that the said SM McFarland enter into a 
recognizance to the Territory of Washington
in the sum of Three hundred dollars for
his appearance at the next regular term of the
District Court of Columbia County Washington
Territory holding terms at Dayton there to
answer said charge.</p>

<p>That the said SM McFarland did not enter
into such recognizance whereupon the
said Justice of the Peace committed the said
SM McFarland into my custody as Sheriff
and Keeper of the County Jail of said County
by his commitment in writing duly issued
a true copy of which is hereunto annexed
marked Exhibit "A" and made a part of this return</p>

<p>That the restraint complained of by the
said SM McFarland is the restaint in which
I hold him by virtue of said commitment</p>

<p>N R Marquiss being duly sworn
says he is the person who makes the foregoing
return. That he has heard the same
read knows the contents thereof and believes
