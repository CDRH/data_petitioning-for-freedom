JOHN AND TACOMA.
---
The amount of time and energy expended by the people of Tacoma in the exclusion of Chinese appears almost ridiculous. Public indignation meetings have been held against the employment by Mr. Riggs of Chinese servants, and the chamber of commerce have coldly, calmly and dispassionately discussed the awful crisis at several well attended meeting.

Tacoma will be victorious over these two poor friendless heathens, and they will have to "vamoose."

This should be one of the proudest days in Tacoma's history. The heart of every true Tacomaite should swell with pride for his native town where forty thousand valiant men, and women, armed to the teeth, have put to route two poor, inoffensive heathens. 

Does it not seem strange, when you come to think about it, that ever since the Chinese were driven by main force from Tacoma, that city, which apparently had everything to its advantage, should have steadily made progress backward, while Seattle, where the leading citizens rose up and prevented this outrage, should have gone the other way with equal rapidity? 

The Argus has no special love for a Chinaman. But it does believe in giving every human being, no matter how lowly their station, all of the rights which are accorded them by law.
