<p> To the Hon Judge of the Law Commissioners Court within &amp; for the County of St Louis. </p>

<p> The undersigend respectfully requests that a writ of Habeas Corpus may be issued by your Honor, to bring before you the person of one Miles Guba, a negro man now unlawfully (as the undersigned believes) detained &amp; confined by the Sheriff of the said County, within the county Jail situated in said Co of St Louis </p>

<p> The said Miles was committed to said jail in the month of <strike> January </strike> March AD 1857 &amp; has there been confined ever since, on the pretence that he is a runaway slave </p>

<p> The circumstances under which he was arrested and committed are as follows. </p>

<p> In January 1857 sd Miles got on board a steamboat at Cairo, Illinois for the purpose of coming up river, that on the way up the clerk of the boat asked him for his fare &amp; he told sd clerk that he had not any money, that the Clerk then asked him if he had free papers &amp; he told him no, but that he was &amp; always had been a free man </p>

<p> That in the arrival of the boat at St Louis the Clerk of the boat took him up to the said jail &amp; then he was put into sd jail by Lewis Musick, the Deputy keeper therof &amp; has ever since been there confined. </p>

<p> The says that the arrest &amp; confinement of sd Miles is unlawful for these reasons </p>


<p>1 That the Sheriff of sd County claims to hold him under the provissions of Chapter 150 of the Revised Statues of Missouir &amp; that the provissions of that chapter <unclear> refute </unclear> wholly to slaves whose masters are residents of the State of Missouri &amp; that the facts of this case about <strike> the </strike> any presumption that said Miles is a slave, is owned by any citizen of Missouri </p>

<p> 2 That said Sheriff has never published the notices required by said Statute in case of the correct <unclear></unclear> runaway slave, though the time has long since elapsed in which such notices should have been given </p>

<p> 3 That a fugitive slave, whose owner resides in another state than Mo, can only be arrested under the provisions of Chapt 70 of the Revised Statute of Mo, or the laws of the United States in such use, made &amp; provided &amp; the said Miles was not arrested or confined according to the provisions of said laws </p>

<p> 4 that all presumptions of law are in favor of freedom &amp; that in the statute such presumptions <unclear> me </unclear> <strike> only if </strike> required to be refutted by some <unclear> forth </unclear> <unclear></unclear> ten to show that the <unclear></unclear> has been held &amp; claimed as a slave, before he can be required to prove that he is a freeman <strike> in order to </strike> that in this case there are no such facts </p>


<p> The undersigned says he has made application to Jail <strike> Louis </strike> Musick, the Deputy Jailor (in whose custody are the wards of committments to sd jail) for a copy of the order upon which said Miles was committed to Jail, that said Musick has declined &amp; refused to let him have a copy, or <unclear></unclear> to him the original. </p>

<p> No application to the knowledge or belief of the undersigned <strike> has </strike> for the relief sought for by this petition has been made to &amp; refused by any Court, officer or officers, superior to the Hon Court to whom this petition is presented </p>
