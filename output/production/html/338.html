    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Annie Dodd and Benjamin F. Dodd gave away 4 of their 9 children, Clara, Marvel, Rosa, and Minnie Dodd, to the Nebraska Children's Home Society. Annie and Benjamin claimed that Annie was in bad health and could not properly take care of their children at the time. They filed a writ of habeas corpus after they claimed that the Nebraska Children's Home Society refused to tell them where their children were and had placed them each under the custody of different people. The counties kids ended up in included Webster, Harlan, and Washington. Annie and Benjamin claimed to have been misled and were under the impression that would be able to get their children back anytime they wanted to. However, the Nebraska Home Society claimed that Annie and Benjamin knew exactly what they had agreed to and had given full consent to waive their rights as parents. Along with this, many witnesses testified that Benjamin was an alcoholic, the children lived in destitute conditions, and they profited off of one of their disabled children as entertainment to make money. The petition was granted for Annie and Benjamin's case against the Nebraska Home Society moved to court for a trial.</li>
