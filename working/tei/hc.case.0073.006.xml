<p>In the District Court holding terms at Seattle, King County,
Washington Territory.</p>

<p>In the matter of the application
of AH SAM and AH WHO for a writ of
Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>On reading and filing the petition of Ah Sam and Ah Who duly
signed and verified whereby it appears that they and each of them
are illegally imprisoned and restrained of their liberty by John
H. McGraw sheriff of King County, Washington Territory and stating
wherein the illegality consists, from which it appears to me that 
a writ of habeas corpus should issue. It is ordered that a writ
of habeas corpus issue directed to said John H. McGraw sheriff of 
said King County commanding him to have the body of said Ah Sam
and Ah Who before me at my chambers at the Court house of the 
District Court, at the City of Seattle, King County, Washington
territory, on the 21st day of February 1885, at the 
hour of four o'clock p.M. on that day to do and receive 
what shall then and there be considered concerning said Ah Sam 
and Ah Who, together with the time and cause of their detention
and that he then and there have the said writ.</p>

<p>Dated the 21st day of February
1885 at Seattle, W. T.</p>
