<p>United States District Court</p>
<p>Western District of Washington</p>
<p>Northern Division</p>

<p>No. 6323</p>

<p>Return</p>

<p>In the matter of the application of MOY HING HUN for a writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>To the Honorable Edward E. Cushman, Judge of the District Court of the United States, for the Western District of Washington:</p>

<p>Now comes the respondent, Henry M. White, United States Commissioner of Immigration, for the District of Washington, with headquarters at the port of Seattle, Washington, and for answer to the writ of habeas corpus in the above entitled matter, says that he here produces the said Moy Hing Hun, the person named in the petition for said writ, in obedience to the command and direction thereof; and for further return and answer to said writ avers that he is detaining in his custody the said Moy Hing Hun for deportation from the United States, as an alien Chinese person not entitled to admission under the laws of the United States, under and by virtue of an order of the Secretary of Labor of the United States, issued to him, said respondent, said order being in the words and figures following, to-wit:</p>

<p>Page 1.</p>

<pb/>

<p>No. 55125/150.</p>

<p>September 28, 1921.</p>

<p>In re Moy Hing Hun.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY:</p>

<p>The citizenship of the alleged father of the above-named applicant is established. The board of special inquiry not being satisfied from the evidence presented that the relationship has been established, has voted to exclude, this appeal resulting.</p>

<p>The only prior mention of a person of the applicant's name and date of birth is contained in a record of the admission of an alleged brother, in February of this year. Possibility of paternity also appears to be reasonably shown. The excluding decision, as will be noted by reference to the summary of the chairman of the Board, at marker, page 30, is based upon the fact that there are numerous material discrepancies between the statements of the interested persons. Counsel, apparently conceding the substantial correctness of the summary, have "submitted the case on the record."</p>

<p>The Bureau has read the testimony in the record, and finds that the discrepancies pointed out by the chairman are correctly set forth, and in view of the fact that their existence is conceded by counsel, it is not deemed necessary to again enumerate them here.</p>

<p>The testimony is along the usual lines and does not overcome the unfavorable force of the discrepancies, as noted by the chairman of the Board. It is recommended that the appeal be dismissed.</p>

<p>(Sgd) Alfred Hampton</p>
<p>Assistant Commissioner-General</p>

<p>So ordered:</p>
<p>(Sgd) E.J. Henning</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary</p>

<p>(Dedicant being a code word its translation is follows: Secretary has affirmed excluding decision case of following named alien and directs deportation).</p>

<p>Page 3</p>

<pb/>

<p>Respondent attaches hereto the original record, decision, and exhibits, both on the hearing before the board of special inquiry at Seattle, Washington, and the hearing on appeal to the Secretary of Labor, which papers constitute a part of this return.</p>

<p>And now the respondent having fully answered, prays that said writ may be discharged.</p>
