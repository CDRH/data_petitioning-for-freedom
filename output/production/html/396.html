    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Mack Dwyer filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against sheriff Michael L. Clark on August 29, 1919. Dwyer's petition stated that he was charged with vagrancy on August 28, 1919. The Police magistrate found Dwyer guilty, fined him $100, and committed him to the Omaha County Jail until the judgment was complied with. Dwyer's petition stated that the law that he was charged under&#x2014;Section 290 of the Criminal Code of the State of Nebraska&#x2014;mandated that the fine for the offense should not exceed $50. Thus, Dwyer stated that the judgment was null, void, and illegal. On August 29, 1919, Judge William A. Redick commanded that Clark bring the body of Dwyer before the court for a hearing on August 30, 1919. Dwyer's application was granted. The appearance docket stated that Dwyer remained in jail but would be discharged upon payment of a $50 fine, suggesting that the judge voided the $100 fine and reduced it to $50.</li>
