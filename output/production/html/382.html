    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On July 7th, 1918, the bound party, Madge Weeks, was arrested for keeping an ill-governed house. The case was tried in police court by James F. Fitzgerald who ordered that Weeks be jailed for twenty days. On July 11th, Weeks appealed to the district court for a bond, which was approved. It is then alleged by the bound party that the Chief of Police refused to acknowledge the bond and was held in custody beyond the remainder of her sentence. On July 30th, a writ of Habeas Corpus was filed and said writ was granted and called for the discharge of the bound party on August 1st.</li>
