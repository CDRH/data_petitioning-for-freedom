    <li>Summary of Proceedings: William Lemke petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve his nine-year-old son, Paul Lemke, from the custody of Anna Guthmann, which was granted. The 1920 U.S. federal census indicates that William was a widower and that Paul was Anna's great-nephew (presumably, Anna was the aunt of William's late wife and Paul's late mother). After hearing the evidence, the district court awarded custody of Paul to his father. Anna successfully appealed the case to the state supreme court, which overturned the ruling of the district court and returned Paul to the custody of his great-aunt.</li>
