    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Arthur Treichel was born on Christmas Day, 1917, to Maude P. and August Treichel. Census records indicate that he had an older brother named Julius, but we know even less about his fate than we do about Arthur's. He was born into a fractured family: Although his parents were still married, they lived separately. A few years after his son's birth, in May 1919, August left his wife and children for "parts unknown." In that same month, Maud gave Arthur to his aunt and uncle, Adolph and Marie Holz, and set off for California. Both were immigrants from Germany. But little Arthur's troubles didn't end there: In February 1919, Adolph Holz fell ill, confined to his bed and unable to work. As census records indicate the family survived off of odd jobs Adolph did around the neighborhood, this must have plunged the family into desperation. Feeling that she could no longer support the chlid, Marie surrendered her nephew to the Child's Saving Institute. However, when Adolph recovered, Marie went to ask for her ward back, but the officials at the Institute refused. Time and again, Marie returned, but each time they refused, giving a different reason each time. Finally, on October 4, 1919, the couple filed a writ of habeus corpus, demanding that the Institute and its leaders produce Treichel in court on October 6. The Douglas County sheriff and his deputy went to the Institute, but there was no Arthur Treichel to be found, and so the case was dismissed&#x2014;to add insult to injury, the Holzes also had to pay the court costs. </li>
