      <p class="tei_p">My dear 
parents it is under very disagreeable 
circumstances that I now write these few lines 
hoping that you will see the immediate necessity 
of either sending me my free papers or something 
to prove who I am for I am now in 
Jail <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">with[?]</span> no prospect of getting out without my 
proving myself free please write as soon 
as possible. I shall direct this to Frederick at 
the Broadway hotel for I do not know where 
you live at.. you must excuse this I have 
to write on my knee.. I have been in jail 
now for more than a week and have not 
had an opportunity of writing before.. 
give my love to mother, sister, Frederick, Gardnor 
Jones and all enquiring friends no more 
But remain your <del>undifect</del> undutiful 
son</p>

      <p class="tei_p">George W. Turley</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Direct yours to the care of Mr. Jas <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">M[?]</span>
