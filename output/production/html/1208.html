    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Stella Williams petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve her son, Horace Godden, from the custody of Charles and Frances Pollard, which was granted. The Pollards were Horace's aunt and uncle, as Frances was the sister of Horace's deceased father. They had assumed custody of Horace after his father's death, with Stella signing a contract allowing the Pollards' custody and education of her son. Stella had now remarried and said she had a comfortable home for her son. After hearing the evidence, Godden was remanded to the custody of the Pollards and Williams ordered to pay the court costs, although Horace was to be allowed to visit his mother every summer. </li>
