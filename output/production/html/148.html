    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On June 28, 1918, John Murray filed for habeas against Julia A. McCaustland over the custody of his 10-year-old son, Harry. Murray charged that McCaustland had taken the child after the death of his wife, the mother of the child, and that McCaustland does not provide proper care for the child, even alleging that she abuses the child. McCausland accused John being an alcoholic and having threatened to kill her if she didn't surrender the boy. She also said that Murray had no home of his own and would give the boy to his sister to raise. A writ was issued and on return McCaustland provided support that she and her husband had raised the child since 5 weeks old and had adopted at 10 months, and that John Murray had abandoned the child after the death of his wife. On August 29, Judge Estelle ruled for the writ to be dismissed and the care of Harry remain with Mrs. McCausland.</li>
