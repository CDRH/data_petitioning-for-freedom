    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Petitioner, George Gumm, stated that he was unlawfully deprived of his liberty by Douglas County Sheriff F. J. McShane. On 8 May 1916, a complaint was filed against Gumm, charging him with Vagrancy. He was then tried before the Omaha Police Magistrate and was sentenced to serve 90 days in the Douglas County Jail. The Police Magistrate is not named in the petition, but Charles E. Foster was serving as the Police Judge during this time period (1912-1917). This petition stated that the Police Magistrate did not have jurisdiction to try and sentence Gumm. The complaint filed by City Prosecutor T. J. McGuire referenced &#x201C;Dope&#x201D; and &#x201C;Opium&#x201D; and the Vagrant Complaint which lists Rick &amp; Pszauowski (first names not listed) as Witnesses for the State has a note which says &#x201C;Peddling Dope.&#x201D; Judge Willis G. Sears ordered that the writ be issued, returnable on 24 June 1916. An Amended Petition was filed on 28 June 1916. This petition stated that the aforementioned conviction was obtained without a trial by jury and was therefore void. This petition also stated that on 3 June 1916, a pardon was issued by the Mayor of Omaha, &#x201C;remitting the penalty and costs imposed upon him by said Police Magistrate, and ordering his release from custody.&#x201D; Daniel Horrigan, Gumm&#x2019;s attorney, stated that this petition was presented to Sheriff McShane but McShane refused to release Gumm from custody. Thus, this amended petition asked for a Writ of Habeas Corpus to be issued such that McShane abides by the Mayor&#x2019;s pardon. The outcome of this amended petition is not noted. </li>
