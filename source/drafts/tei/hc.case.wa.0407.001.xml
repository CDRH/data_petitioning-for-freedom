<pb/>
<ab>Territory of Washington,
Third Judicial District,
County of King,| ss.</ab>
<ab>In the District Court Holding terms at Seattle.</ab>
<ab>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</ab>
<ab>x No.
In the matter of the application <del>of</del>
of William Spears, and James <del>M</del>
McGough for a writ of habeas x
corpus
x Petition</ab>
<ab>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</ab>
<ab>To Hon. Roger S. Greene, Judge of the above entitled 
Court:
Come now the plaintiffs above named, by their attorney
and complaining allege and show as follows:</ab>
<p>1. That said plaintiffs, and each of them, are now illegally imprisoned and restrained of their liberty by <del>John H. McGraw, Sheriff</del> <add>H. G. Thornton Constable of King County, Washington Territory <del>in the
jail of said King County</del></add></p>
<p>2. That the cause, or pretense of the said restraint according
to the best knowledge and belief of the said plaintiffs,
is that on the 9th day of November, 1883, at said King
County one T.H. Cann, one of the Justices of the Peace in and
for said King County, made an order requiring the said plaintiffs,
and each of them, to enter into recognizance before
him with sureties, in the sum of one Hundred dollars.
conditioned for <del>the said plaintiffs, and each of them,</del> the
appearance of the said plaintiffs, and each of them, before
this Court on the <del>n</del> first day of the next regular term thereof,
and from day to day and term to term thereafter, to answer
to a charge alleged to have been made against the said
plaintiffs of the crime of obtaining money under false pretenses,
in violation of the Statutes of this Territory. And
in default of such recognizance, the said Justice of the Peace
issued a committment directed to him, the said <del>Sheriff</del> <add>Constable</add>
whereby the said plaintiffs, and each of them, were committed
to the said jail, and to the custody of said <del>Sheriff</del> <add>Constable</add> until
they, the said plaintiffs, should be discharged according to
law, and plaintiffs <del>were, and</del> and each of them, were, on the
said 9th day of November, 1883, under pretense of said writ
and not otherwise, taken into custody by said <del>Sheriff</del> <add>Constable</add> <del>and</del>
imprisoned <del>in the said jail</del>, and the said <del>Sheriff</del> <add>Constable</add> now imprisions
said plaintiffs, and each of them, as aforesaid, under
pretense of the said committment, and not otherwise.</p>
<p>3. That the said restraint and imprisionment is illegal
<pb></pb>
and that the illegality thereof, consists in this: 1st. That
the said plaintiffs, and each of them, are not guilty of obtaining
money under false pretenses, or any crime whatever,
and there is no probable cause for an accusation against said
plaintiffs, or wither of them, of said crime, or any crime
whatever; and there is no evidence whereby it can be made to 
appear that such probable cause exists. 2d. That the complaint
on which the proceedings against said plaintiffs hereinbefore
mentioned are founded does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a crime or misdemeanor, and said complaint
is untrue. 3d. No complaint on oath has been made
charging said plaintiffs, or either of them, with the commission
of said crime of obtaining money under false pretenses,
or any crime whatever.</p>
<p>Wherefore, plaintiffs pray that they may be forthwith delievered
from said imprisonment, <del>and for <unclear></unclear> against said 
Sheriff for costs,</del> and for such other relief in the premises
as to the Court shall seem meet.</p>
<ab>C.H. Hanford
Attorney for Plaintiffs.</ab>
