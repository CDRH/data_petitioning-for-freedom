    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Caleb Sykes was charged with fraudulent breach of trust and larceny 
and was a fugitive from justice from the state of Tennessee. 
They said he stole from the three men (Cassleburry, Borum, Roberts) things of the value of three hundred dollars of the proper goods and chattels with the intent to convert to the same to his own use. 
Sykes fled from the state of Tennessee, arrested in Omaha and was being held for Tennessee authorities

Caleb says that he left Tennessee in January when there was no indictment pending when he left, nor any property delivered into his possession. He says he is a resident of Nebraska and married with three children. Rumors were circulating that he had an intimate relationship with a woman in Memphis and then some threats were made against him. They then came to his house and tried to break in so he left because he thought his life was in danger. 

Sykes presented all of this information to court and writ was allowed and he was released.
