    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On December 1, 1923, the petitioner J.C.A Houselighter, Helen Victoria, May Young, and seven other people were arrested at Houselighter's residence. Houselighter was charged with keeping a disorderly house, while the others arrested were charged with being inmates of a disorderly house. On December 3 Houselighter, Victoria, and Young were fined $10.00 each while the others arrested were released, and Houselighter paid $37.50 as fines on their behalfs. Houselighter was released, but Victoria and Young were sent back to jail to perform blood tests as part of an examination for venereal diseases. After being detained for three weeks without any examination, Houselighter filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus on behalf of Victoria, his stepdaughter, and Young, his friend. The writ was denied, Helen Victoria and Mary Young were remanded to the custody of the respondents. </li>
