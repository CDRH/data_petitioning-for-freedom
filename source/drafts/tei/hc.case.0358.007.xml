<p>COMES now the respondent, <del>Henry M. White</del> John H Sargent, United states Acting Commissioner of Immigration for the <add>Western</add> District of Washington, and produces the body of GEORGE KOTROS, in obedience to the command and direction of the writ of habeas corpus in the above entitled matter, being the person named in the petition of said writ.</p>

<p>For answer and return to said writ, respondent avers that he detained in his custody the body of George Kotros for deportation from the United States as an alien person not entitled to admission under the laws of the United States, under and by virtue of an order of the Secretary of Labor of the United States, issued to him, the said respondent, said order being in the words and figures following, to wit:</p>

<p>U.S. Department of Labor</p>

<p>In Answering Refer to No.54848/86</p>

<p>Commissioner of Immigration,</p>
<p>Seattle, Wash.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>The Bureau acknowledges the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, No. 37012/561, transmitting record of hearing accorded the alien GEORGEOS KOTROZIS, alias GEORGE KOTROS, who entered at the port of Sumas, Wash., on May 23, 1920.</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>" After a careful examination of the evidence submitted in this case, the Department is of opinion that the alien is in the United States in violation of law. You are therefore directed to cause him to be taken into custody and conveyed to New York, N.Y., for deportation, the expense incident to such conveyence, including the employment of an attendant to assist in delivery, if necessary, at a nominal compensation of $1.00 and expenses both ways, being authorized, payable from the appropriation "Expenses of Regulating Immigration, 1921."</p>

<p>The alien's conveyance to New York, N.Y., in connection with a party, should be deferred until definite arrangements have been made with the Ellis Island Office for his return to Greece and sailing dates furnished you by that office.</p>

<p>TRespectfully, "ALFRED HAMPTON"</p>

<p>Approved:</p>

<p>Assistant Commissioner General</p>

<p>Assistant Secretary.</p>
<p>Inclose W.D.No. 3248.</p>

<p>Respondent attaches hereto the record, decisions and exhibits, both on the hearing before him as Commissioner of Immigration, and the hearing on appeal of the Secretary of Labor, which constitute a part of this return.</p>

<p>And now the respondent having fully answered, he prays the said writ may be discharged.</p>

<p>John M Sargent</p>

<p>United States of America</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 7th day of February, 1921.</p>
