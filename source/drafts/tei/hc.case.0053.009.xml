<p>State of Ohio County of Erie ss } Portland Township</p>

<p>I, Gurden Gekrey being duly 
sworn do depose and say that I 
was born in the Town of <unclear>Lisbon</unclear> 
County of Windham and State 
of Connecticut and shall be 
sixty five years of age on the fourth 
day of August Eighteen hundred 
and fifty eight - I resided in the 
said State of Connecticut until 
I was twenty six years and 
then removed to Scipio Township 
Cayuga County, State of New York 
where I remained about six years 
and then removed to what is 
now Scipio Township, Seneca 
County State of Ohio where I 
remained about ten years and 
removed to Portland Township Erie 
County State of Ohio where I have 
since continued to reside and still 
reside - I was married when I 
was twenty one years of age and on the 
last day of November of that year. I 
remember it was Thanksgiving Day 
and was in Trenton New London County 
State of Connecticut to Betsy Pierce 
who was brought in near by and was

in the Town of Exeter State of Rhode 
Island as I was always informed and 
believe - Louisa Gekrey was my 
daughter by my said wife Betsy 
and was born in the said Town of 
Preston in January Eighteen hundred 
and sixteen - She lived with me 
until she was married to John 
Schooner which was in said Seneca 
County, Ohio when she was about sixteen 
years old. I was present at their 
marriage, Elihu Schooner was the 
child of said Louisa and John Schooner 
above named and was born in Reed 
Township in said Seneca County 
Ohion within a year after they were 
married as above stated - Said John 
Schooner died about four years after 
they were married and the said Louisa 
died about five years after her said 
marriage - John died in the State of New 
York and Louisa died at 
<unclear>....ville</unclear> Seneca County Ohio, 
I have known said Elihu since his 
birth and he is my grandson, He 
will be twenty-six years old next 
November or December - He is and 
always has been a free man and 
never a slave. The said Elihu 
has a scar in his under lip, holes in his 
ears for rings, has burley hair and

same appearance of Indian which he gets from his 
Father who was a half Indian. He 
was married about Eighteen hundred 
fifty and his wife died with Cholera 
in Eighteen hundred fifty five leaving 
one child which now lived 
in this County </p>
