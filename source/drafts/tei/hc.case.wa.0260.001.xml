confinement and restraint are illegal and
that the illegality thereof consists in this towit -</p>

<p>That on or about the 13th day of April 1878

Olympia in said County and Territory, upon
a warrant sworn out by one I.V. Morsman,
charging him with the crime of murder,
committed in the town of Olympia in the
year 1874. That on the 19th and 20th days
of April 1878 a preliminary hearing was had
before one A.R. Elder, a committing magistrate

said County, and at the close of said hearing
your petitioner was committed by said Elder
to answer the said charge, before the next
Grand Jury in and for said County.</p>

crime charged. That the next Grand Jury
will not meet until December next, some eight
months from this time, and that your petitioner
will, unless your Honor grant his petition, be

time to his great detriment both of body and

may have a hearing before your Honor and
that your Honor will review the known
testimony upon which he was committed.</p>

<p>Wherefore your Petitioner prays that

body of your Petitioner before your Honor,
