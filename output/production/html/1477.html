    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Daniel Doodey petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that he was being unlawfully deprived of his liberty by Sheriff Trompen after he was judged insane by a commission the day previous. Judge Tuttle granted the petition. After hearing evidence, Tuttle allowed the writ and ordered that Doodey be released from custody. The next day, Doodey filed for divorce from his wife, Mary Ann Doodey, claiming that she gave false testimony that resulted in him being institutionalized in an insane asylum. The Judge granted the divorce, but sided with Mary Ann and granted her custody of their children.</li>
