In the District Court, holding terms at Seattle in King County, Washington Territory.

#4882

In the matter of the application of Yu Gum and Yu Hung for a Writ of Habeas Corpus:
No 4882

It appearing by the petition of Yu Gum and Yu Hung (Chinawomen) that they the said
Yu Gum and Yu Hung are unlawfully restrained of their liberty by one Charles Henry,
Deputy U.S. Marshall of Washington Territory in the County jail of King County, Washington
Territory, which petition states wherein said illegality of their restraint consists,
and from which it appears that a writ of habeas corpus ought to issue.

It is by me, Roger S. Greene, Judge of the above-entitiled Court, ordered that a writ
of Habeas Corpus, under the seal of said Court, issue, directed to the said Charles
Henry, Deputy Marshall as aforesaid, commanding him to have the bodies of said Yu
Gum and Yu Hung before me in the Court Room of said Court, on the 11th day of May,
A.D. 1886, at the hour of 2 o'clock P.M. of that day, to do and receive what shall
then and there be considered concerning the said Yu Gum and Yu Hung, together with
the time and cause of their detention, and that he have then and there said writ.

Dated at Seattle, W.T. May 8th 1886.
Greene
Judge
