Remarkably, the 10 year-old girl escaped, but she was then found by King S. Woolsey, a renowned Indian killer, who was leading an anti-Apache and gold-scouting expedition in the vicinity <a href="/stories/lucia-martinez">[...]</a></p>

        <p>On January 26, 1887, Katherine (Katie) Marie Dora Yaeger married Franklin Pierce Mayes in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Between the years of 1888 and 1901, Katie and Franklin had four sons: John, George, Leroy, and Leslie. They eventually moved to Lincoln and then separated. Despite outlining different reasons for their separation, the couple agreed that they had been separated for several years prior to Katie’s petition <a href="/stories/katie-mayes">[...]</a></p>
