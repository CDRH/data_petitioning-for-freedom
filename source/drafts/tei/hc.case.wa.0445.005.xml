Territory of Washington,
    County of King,     ss.
</p>
<p>
I, H. F. Jones, being first duly sworn on my oath depose and say:
    That I am over the age of twenty one years, that I am an Attorney and counsellor at law, duly authorized to practice in the courts of Washington Territory.
</p>
<p>
    That one O. D. Butterfield, at present acting as chief of police and keeper 
of the jail of the city of Seattle unlawfully imprisones, detains, and retrains 
and confines one Howard McMillan. That the said 
Howard McMillan Did on the ninth day of May 1889,
send for this affiant, that said message was intrusted to an officer
under the said Buterfield as thes affiant verily beleives that the same 
was not delivered, that on the tenth day of May affiant acting as an 
attorney and in no other capacity visited said jail; but was refused
admission thereto by the jailer acting, as this affiant is informed
and beleives under the direction of the said Buterfield.
That this affiant applied to the said Buterfield for permission to see 
the said Howard McMillen in the capacity of an attorney, and 
that after four hours of persistent effort was allowed to see the said...
 Howard McMillen That this affiant is a Notary Public, 
in and for Washington Territory, and that as such Notary Public this affiant 
swore the said Howard McMillen to the petition hereunto 
attached, after having read the same to the said Howard McMillen. 
That this affiant asked the said Howard McMillen to sign the 
same when the said Buterfield with two assistants took hold of this affiant 
and forceable removed him therefrom and forthwith confined the said 
Howard McMillen in a cell and refused to allow him the said 
Howard McMillen to sign the same.
                H. F. Jones
Subscribed and sworn to before me this 11th day of May 1889
    <unclear>Richard Osborn</unclear>
Notary Public, in and for Washington Territory.
