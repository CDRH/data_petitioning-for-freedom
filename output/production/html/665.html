    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In early August 1913, Edward Blackfish was arrested and charged with assaulting Lydia Chief on the Winnebago Reservation. Both Blackfish and Chief were members of the Winnebago nation who had accepted land allotments under the Dawes Act. The U.S. District Court for the Omaha Division of the District of Nebraska set his bail at $2,000 and placed him in the Douglas County jail. Blackfish petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that he was a citizen of Nebraska and could only be tried in state court. The respondents demurred, arguing the federal jurisdiction applied. After hearing the evidence, the court sustained the demurrer and remanded Blackfish to the custody of his jailer.</li>
