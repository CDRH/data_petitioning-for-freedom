<p>In the District Court holding
terms at Seattle
King County ss</p>

<p>In the matter of the 
application of Qui (a
Chinaman) for a writ of
habeas corpus</p>

<p>To the 
Hon. Roger S Greene Judge 
of said court</p>

<p>The petition of Qui a 
Chinaman, respectfully shows</p>

<p>1.
That he is unlawfully imprisoned, 
detained, confined and restrained 
of his liberty by John H McGraw Sheriff
of King County, Washington Territory.</p>

<p>2. 
That said imprisonment, detention
confinement and restraint are
illegal; and that said illegality consists in this to wit:</p>

<p>That in the 17th day of November 
1884 at Port Madison in Kitsap County
before Henry C Hale a Justice of the Peace
in and for Port Madison Precinct in 
Kitsap County a sworn complaint was 
<del>filed</del> made before said Justice, by some 
<pb/>
person to your petitioner unknown
whereby your petitioner was charged 
with the alleged offense of smoking and 
inhaling opium on said County on the 
_ day of November 1884</p>

<p>That upon said complaint a 
warrant was issued by said Justice 
upon which warrant your petitioner
was arrested and brought before said 
Justice; that then after such proceedings 
were had in said complaint that on the said 
17 day of November your petitioner was 
tried before said Justice for said 
alleged offense and after such trial 
your petitioner was found guilty of said
alleged offense and was by the Judgment 
of said Court sentenced to imprisonment, 
for the period of sixteen days</p>

<p>That thereupon said Justice Court 
issued its warrant of commitment, 
a true copy of which is annexed to this
petition marked Exhibit "A" and intending to act under such warrant of 
Commitment, the Sheriff of Kitsap County 
brought your petitioner to the County Jail
of King County and then on the said 17th 
day of November 1884 delivered him unto 
the custody of the said John H McGraw Sheriff
of King County, who now detain him in 
<pb/>
custody and restrains him from his 
liberty, having an other authority or 
pretext <unclear>san</unclear> and expecting said writ
of Commitment</p>

<p>That said trial and commitment 
were had by virtue of Section 2073 of the
Code of Washington; that said Section is 
unconstitutional and void and that 
said arrest commitment and trial 
are without authority of law; that the 
said complaint prepared against your
petitioner charges no offense; and said 
Justice had no power or jurisdiction 
to render said judgment of imprisonment</p>

<p>Wherefor your petitioner prays,
that a writ of habeas corpus may
issue directed to said John H McGraw
Sheriff of King County, commanding 
him to have the body of your petitioner 
before your Honor at a time and place 
therein to be specified, to do and receive 
what shall then and there be ordered 
concerning him, together with the time and
cause of his detention and said writ 
and that your petitioner may be 
restored of his liberty</p>

<p>Dated Nov 18, 1884

Steve Harris + M Micken
Attys for petitioner</p>
