<p> To the Hon J.R. Lewis Judge of the District Court for the 3rd judicial district of Washington Territory the petition and complaint of <gap></gap> Matthews <gap></gap> Lewis and Thomas Wright respectfully shows, </p>

<p> That they are each unlawfully imprisoned detained, confined, and restrained of their liberty by J.J. A. VanBokkelen, Sheriff of Jefferson County Washington Territory, at the jail of said county at Port Townsend. </p>

<p> That the cause or pretense of said restraint is, a commitment issued by Wm. H.

in the second degree, said alleged crime being charged as the killing of a Hydah Indian named <gap></gap> on or about the 2nd day of May 1895. at Port Ludlow in said Jefferson County </p>

<p> That the illegality of said restraint consists in this, that there is no evidence against your petitioners to warrant the accusation made against them. </p>

<p> Wherefore your petitioners pray that a writ of Habeas Corpus may be granted, directed to said J.J. H. VanBokkelen commanding him to have the bodies of the said petitioners to wit John Matthews, Joseph Lewis and Thomas Wright before your Honor at a time and place therein specified to do and receive what shall then and there be considered by your Honor concerning them and that said J.J. H VanBokkelen may then and there be required to make return of said writ together with thetime when your petitioners were placed in his custody and the cause of their detention, and that they may be restored to their liberty. </p>
