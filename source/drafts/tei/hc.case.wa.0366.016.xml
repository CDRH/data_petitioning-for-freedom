<p>Province of Saskatchewan</p>

<p>THE KING vs. FLETCHER DECKER.</p>

<p>THE DEPOSITION of CHARLES BURDETTE ROBINSON, taken this 25th day of July A.D. 1921 before she undersigned Alexander Joseph Gordon MacEchen, a Justice of the Peace in and for the Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada, in the matter of Fletcher Decker who is charged upon oath for that he on or about the 15th day of November in the year of our Lord One thousand nine hundred and fifteen near Wiwa Hill Post Office in the Province of Saskatchewan aforesaid did steal about 300 bushels of flax the property of Claude Ficklin and was thereby guilty of theft.</p>

<p>Now the said CHARLES BURDETTE ROBINSON on his oath saith as follows:</p>

<p>I am a brother of Cassius M. Olay Robinson, and am a farmer residing on the North-West quarter of Section Ten (10), Township Fourteen (14), Range Five (5), West of the Third Meridian in the Province of Saskatchewan in the Domion of Canada, and have been living on the said land since the spring of 1913.</p>

<pb/>

<p>This quarter on which I have been living is approximately five miles from Wiwa Hill Post Office in the Province of Saskatchewan. I have known Fletcher Decker for about fourteen years. I know him in Idaho, one of the United States of America, before he came to Canada. He lived there in Coeur D'Alene City. He came to Canada before I did. In the year 1915 Fletcher Decker was living about three miles south of my place in the Province of Saskatchewan. In the fall of 1915 I heard in Gravelbourg in the said Province of Saskatchewan that Claude Ficklin had had some flax stolen, and that it had been traced to Fletcher Decker. My brother Cassius M. Clay Robinson was living in the vicinity at that time. I told him what I had heard about Fletcher Decker. I knew that my said brother had business dealing with Fletcher Decker. I was at my said brother's place the morning after I had told him what I had heard about Fletcher Decker. While I was at my brother's place on the said morning Fletcher Decker came up to get a team of horses from my brother. My said brother Cassius had a conversation that morning with Fletcher Decker in my presence. My said brother asked Fletcher Decker how much flax he had taken from Ficklin. Fletcher Decker first denied having taken any flax. My brother continued to accuse him of the theft of Ficklin's flax, and Fletcher Decker at last owned up that he did take it. To the best of my recollection</p>

<pb/>

<p>-3-</p>

<p>Decker said that he took about four hundred bushels. My brother told Fletcher Decker that he thought Decker was likely to be arrested, and asked him what was to be done about his, that is, my brother's, horses. There was some discussion about this. Fletcher Decker first saying he did not know what could be done about the horses, and that at last agreeing that if he was arrested the horses would be turned over to me.</p>

<p>Fletcher Decker is no longer in my vicinity in the Province of Saskatchewan. I understand that he is at present in the United States of America. He was arrested for the theft of the flax already mentioned and let out on bail, and skipped his bail. I have not seen him since he skipped his bail. He was arrested in the Province of Saskatchewan. My said  brother Cassius and I had arranged the night I told him about what I had heard concetning the theft of Ficklin's flax, that when Fletcher Decker came to his place the next morning he would question him about it to find out whether he had stolen Ficklin's flax.</p>

<p>(Signed) Charles Burdette Robinson</p>
