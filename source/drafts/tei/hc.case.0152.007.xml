<p>That from my best inform-
ation the alleged facts re-
lating to the formidible out
of which said action grew,
are not generally known
to the people of said pre-
cinct ad that they generally
have not formed an opin-
ion as to the guilt or in-
nocence of said defendant,
and that the people of said 
precinct are not prejudiced
against said Ray Raymond
applicant further said that
there are about four hun-
dred people living in said
Peone precinct and that
applicant verily believes that
a large number of good
unprejudiced and loyally
qualified jurors can be
summoned and because

as jurors in said action.
An further applicant
saith not.
