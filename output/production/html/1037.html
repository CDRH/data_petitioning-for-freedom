    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Ike Payne is also present in the database in a set of cases from 1918. Payne filed another petition for a writ of habeas corpus against Sheriff Michael L. Clark on January 31, 1919. On October 10, 1918, the police magistrate had found Ike Payne guilty of a complaint alleging that he had possessed intoxicating liquor (Payne's second offense) and transported intoxicating liquor. Payne was sentenced to a fine of $100 and detention in jail until the fine was paid. Payne's petition argued that the complaint did not charge Payne with an offense under Nebraska law, that the police magistrate had no power to impose fines or to try Payne for what he was accused of, and that the finding of the Court was invalid because it did not specify which of the two alleged crimes Payne was being found guilty and sentenced for. Judge Arthur Wakely issued a writ commanding that Payne come before the Court and justify his detention of Payne; a hearing was held and Judge William A. Redick denied his application. A motion for a new trial arguing that the judge had erred in denying the habeas petition is also included in the case file. Payne was remanded to custody of the sheriff with supersedeas bond fixed at $200. Payne was released on recognizance on February 19, 1919, with Peter Lafagis as surety. </li>
