    <li>Summary of Proceedings: George McBride, the father of Margarie McBride (3 yo), lost custody of Margarie after a divorce proceeding by Lillian McBride, her mother, on the grounds of cruelty and nonsupport. Judge Estelle denied the divorce, but Lillian did succeed in separating herself from George. George McBride argues that he has a pleasant home with his parents, Robert McBride and Mary McBride. The court ruled that Lillian McBride, as the mother, is most capable of raising Margarie. This decision is informed by Sarah McPerrin, the mother of Lillian, who was aware of the cruelty of George and is capable of providing for the child. George McBride was allowed to see the child once a week, care for her once a month, and purchase clothing and necessities for the child. George was also ordered to conduct himself peacefully and to not interfere with or molest Lillian McBride during his visits. However, by 1910 George and Lillian had made up and were living together in Omaha, according to the census that year. </li>
