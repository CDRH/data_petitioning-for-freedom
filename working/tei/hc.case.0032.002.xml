<p> The petition of Joseph Adams Respectfully showeth </p>

<p> That on the Eleveneth of (11) day of May AD. 1854. your petitioner was arrested and upon the oath of two polic officers named Barry &amp; Beecher was committed by Justice Johnston to the Jail of St. Louis Co. kept by one James Castello, where he has been detained ever since, and where he is now detained. The charge exhibited against your sd. petitioner is, that he is A fugitive from labour, and A slave: To which charge your petitioner humbly says, that he is a free man, and always has been free, except for and during a term of years when he was bound as an apprentice to a certain Dr. Richard Barrett of the City and county of St. Louis, all of which he is ready to verify, your petitioner alleges that he is illegally held in imprisonment by the sd. James Castello, and who refused to release your sd. petitioners, he therefore prays your Honor to grant him the benefit of A writ of Habeas Corpus directed to the sd. James Castello requiring him to produce the body of your petitioner before your Honor together with the cause of his detention, and he will abide the decision of your Honor in the premises and for which he will ever pray. </p>
