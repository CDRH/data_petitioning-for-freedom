<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT,
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON,
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>In re application of 
CHIN QUOCK WAH 
and 
CHING HIN
for Writ of Habeas Corpus. ) 
#2857
MEMORANDUM BRIEF.</p>

<p>Practically the same points are raised in both of 
these cases, and a brief on one can be considered as 
controlling the other.</p>
<p>In the Chin Quock Wah case it is objected that the 
petitioner was not allowed counsel, and he was not appraised
of his right to have witnesses to appear for and in his 
behalf, and that he was denied the right to face his 
witnesses.</p>
<p>Covering this point the law is found in the Chinese
Exclusion Act, on page 38, in the following language:</p>
    <p>"(b) The said examination shall be separate and apart 
    from the public, in the presence of Government officials 
    and such other persons only as the officer in charge
    shall permit. All witnesses appearing on behalf of any 
    applicant shall be fully heard."</p>
<p>Under this act, in the case of United States v. 
Williams, 190 Fed. 898, it was held that an immigrant in 
such cases was not entitled to be represented by counsel, 
and the court on page 899, uses the following language:</p>
    <p>"There is nothing in the statute which calls for the 
    presence of counsel at the examination of aliens 
    preliminary to admission; nothing to indicate that it was 
    the intent of Congress that these investigations in 
    hundreds of thousands of cases touching the qualifications
    of an alien seeking to enter were to be conducted as
    trials in court, with counsel present to represent the 
    alien, witnesses called to testify, and elaborate 
    examination and cross-examination of them."</p>
<fw>-1-</fw>
<pb/>
<p>The next point raised by both cases will be found 
in paragraphs 3 and 4, pages 2, 3 and 4 of the petition, 
where it is in effect alleged that the appeal of the 
petitioner was not properly heard heard because J. B. Densmore,
the Solicitor of the Department of Labor, made the 
finding while the Secretary and Assistant Secretary of 
Labor were present, contrary to the law in such cases 
provided. The point in the brief is that when an appeal is 
made to the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Labor 
and his Assistant are in the office, no one but these two 
officers has the power to review the appeal. The attorneys 
for the petitioner try to sustain their position by citing 
Section 177, 178 and 179 Revised Statutes, 3 Fed. St. Ann.
61,62. The first of these provisions is to the effect that 
in case of death, resignation, absence or sickness of the 
head of any Department, the first or sole assistant thereof
shall perform the duties of such thereof shall perform the 
duties of such head until a successor is appointed or until 
such absence or sickness shall cease.. This section and the 
two succeeding sections are emergency measure, meant to 
take care of the office on the occurence of such exigencies
as the statute sets forth. It might be that if the Secretary
was absent because no one was in the office with his authority
the office would cease to perform its duties, but this 
is not meant to limit the authority of the Assistant of the 
Secretary and his Chief while they are in the office, because
a contingency of their absence is covered by the statute
this does not mean that this same statute gives a rule as to 
the conduct of the office when they are present.</p>
<fw>-2-</fw>
<pb/>
<p>The phase of the law covering the conduct of the 
office when the officers are present is found at 3 Fed. St.
Ann. 58, Sec. 161 R.S., in the following language:</p>
    <p>"Sec. 161. (Departmental Regulations) The head of 
    each Department is authorized to prescrive regulations, 
    not inconsistent with law, for the Government of his 
    Department, the conduct of its officers and clerks, 
    the distribution and performance of its business, 
    and the custody, use, and preservation of the records, 
    papers, and property appertaining to it."</p>
<p>This statute clearly gives the Secretary the power 
to get a subordinate to run through the record and for him 
to approve or disapprove of his findings. He has a clerk 
to assist him in any way that may seem to him proper and 
not in the manner that may be dictated by the attorneys for 
various petitioners whose cases come before him.</p>
<p>There is another reason this position of the attorney
for petitioner is untenable. The statute provides as 
follows: 100 Fed. 390:</p>
    <p>"In every case where an alien is excluded from 
    admission into the United States under any law or 
    treaty now existing, or hereafter made, the decision
    of the appropriate customs or immigration officer, if 
    adverse to the admission of such alien, shall be 
    final, unless reversed on appeal to the secretary of 
    the treasury. 28 Stat. 390."</p>
<p>Under this statute it was held in the case of United 
States v. Gin Fung, 100 Fed. 389, that,</p>
    <p>"The circuit court has no jurisdiction of habeas corpus
    proceedings brought by an alien excluded by the collector
    of the port to determine his right to land, since the 
    collector's determination is not reviewable by the 
    courts, buy only on appeal to the secretary of the 
    treasury."</p>
<p>Again the supreme court passed on same point in 
the case of Lee Jung v. Patterson, 46 L. Ed. 1108-10, 186
U. S. 169, 175, in which case the court, at page 175, uses 
the following language:</p>
    <p>"Under the doctrine of these cases, it is immaterial, 
    so far as the jurisdiction of this court is concerned, 
    <add>Supreme Court did not express an opinion
    but quoted from In Re Lee Jung 102 Fed 132</add>
<fw>-3-</fw>
<pb/>
    whether the petitioner's appeal to the Secretary of 
    the Treasury is heard by the Secretary in person or 
    by a subordinate official in his department, or is 
    heard at all."</p>
<p><del>Again the same point was passed on in teh case 
In Re Jem Yuen, 188 Fed. 550, 354</del></p>

<p>Again the same point was raised In Re Lee Lung, 102
Fed. 132, 134:</p>
    <p>"Under the doctrine of these cases, it is immaterial,
    so far as the jurisdiction of this court is concerned, 
    whether the petitioner's appeal to the secretary of 
    the treasury is heard by the secretary in person, or 
    by a subordinate official in his department, or is 
    heard at all. The petition for the writ is dismissed."</p>
<p>Even if there were anything in the contention of the 
attorney, the record in our opinion does not show that the 
Secretary did not pass on the case, thus, see the case of 
In Re Jem Yuen, 188 Fed. 350, 354:</p>
    <p>"Nor do I think that the memorandum <del>or</del> can be considered
    as indicating in any way that the officer whose duty it 
    was to hear and determine the appeal did not hear and
    determine it himself. It cannot be said that the head 
    or the acting head of a department, charged with such a 
    duty, is forbidden to have a subordinate make a 
    preliminary report on it for his guidance.
    Lastly, it is complained that the Secretary of Commerce
    and Labor is not shown by the record to have heard and 
    decided the appeal. I must regard the record as 
    sufficiently showing, in the absence of any evidence to the 
    contrary, that the appeal was heard and decided by the 
    acting secretary. That being the case, I am justified in 
    assuming, until the contrary appears, that the acting 
    secretary was at the time lawfully exercising the 
    secretary's powers. Rev. St. Secs. 177, 178, (U.S.Comp.St.
    1901, p.90); Keyser v. Hitz, 133 U.S. 138, 145, 10 Sup.
    Ct. 290, 33 L. Ed. 531."</p>
