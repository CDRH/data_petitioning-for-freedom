<unclear></unclear> to <unclear></unclear> and examine closely for bullet wounds <unclear>supposing</unclear> he had been shot examine for the benefit of the jury and a <unclear></unclear> found no bullet holes any where in the body lowest mark of violence on the chest near the heart about size <unclear></unclear> peices dark blue looked like he had been struck with something <unclear></unclear> - <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> I could not tell whether made by pistol or not shown pistol - not a <unclear></unclear> in jury dont think <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> him down - <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> think somewhere about the shoulder  <unclear></unclear> with not so regular nothing serious did not examine for bullet hole in clothing found small holes just behind right ear about midway first glancing supposed it to be bullet hole - both knife <unclear>I made</unclear> <unclear></unclear> one <unclear></unclear> wound up one <unclear></unclear> look his two <unclear>of lap</unclear> and decided there up &amp; back <unclear></unclear> and back so that we might examine the skull found no trace of bullet when the skull <unclear></unclear> smooth and intact - <del></del> Wound evidently had been made by that slat and the ear had suffered from that <unclear>blow</unclear> that was the only mark - Examined skull and formed <unclear>throughout</unclear> <unclear></unclear> by that I mean broken in small pieces <unclear></unclear> say past upon the left side large indication could almost put the back of <unclear>your hands</unclear> on left side no other mark of violence - examined nostril mouth and eye for bullet but not mark of any whether

X 2 wounds on body might have been made by a spent bullet  Never had experience with this <unclear>hit</unclear> in that location on the heart my opinion is expertly spoken does not think of clothing on and hit sufficient to cause this mark think it would knock him down - average thickness of an adult mans skull would say from my experience say 1/4 or 3/8 and 1/2 inch - The skull varies in thickness on there is different in thickness in skull of different people</p>

<p>Re X

It would depend somewhat on the weight and momentum - supposing a man was struck sufficiently with and in as much wighing 1/2 an ounce to produce the <unclear></unclear> described would it knock him down - I think not it might knock him down - Death results from fracture of the skull producing both concussion and compression of the brain</p>
