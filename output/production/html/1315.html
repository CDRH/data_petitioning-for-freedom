    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Rose Dodson filed a petition after claiming that her husband George Dodson unlawfully entered the home of her parents and "forcibly and with great violence" took their daughter, Louisa Dodson from her. Rose claimed that she was sick and was in need of her mother's care and that is why she had went to her parents house. However, George Dodson claimed that Rose unlawfully took the child from their home and was conspiring with her parents to keep Louisa away from him. He also refers to Rose as being of &#x201C;fiery temper without provocation and in fits of anger she [had] frequently beaten the infant child brutally and unremorsefully.&#x201D; The writ was originally approved, but then both George and Rose amicably decided they wanted the writ dismissed. It is unknown what the end result of the custody agreement. </li>
