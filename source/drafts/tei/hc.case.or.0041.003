the mother of said children reamined at the residence
of this Respondent, till the spring of 1850, but not controlled
as a slave.</p>
<p>That about the first of March 1850 the said Robin

<p>HABEAS CORPUS</p>
<p>Robin Homes the petitioner in this case respectfully
shows and states to the Court the following answer to
said Respondents return to said writ of Habeas Corpus
to wit. That some time in the year 1841, Said petitioner
and his wife Polly were the slaves of Mayor Whitman a 
Paymaster in the United States Army in Howard County
Missouri and has been the slaves of said Whitman for
the space of twelve years next proceeding said last mentioned
date. That some time in the year 1841 said petitioner
 and his wife Polly were taken on a writ of execution
by said Respondents, who was then sheriff of said
Howard County, and sold at public vender by said
Respondent to satisfy certain debts of said Whitmans. That 
said petitioner and his wife Polly were bid off and purchased
at said sale by a merchant then resident of said
Howard County whose name is not now rembered by
your petitioner. That the next morning after said sale
Respondent sent your petitioner to the house of said
purchaser to procure a waggon to take your petitioner and
his family to the residence of said purchaser. That 
when your petitioner arrived at the house of said purchaser
he was informed by the wife of said purchaser
that he had gone away to purchase goods, and that she
knew nothing about aforesaid purchase of your petitioner
and wife Polly. Your petitioner then returned to the
house of said Respondent, and informed him of what had
transpired at the house of said purchaser, that said Respondent,
replied to your petitioner that the respondent </p>
<pb/>
<p>had made an arrangement to keep him and his wife Polly
 and to remain with him. That your petitioner and his
wife Polly remained in the service of said Respondent
in Howard County aforesaid until the spring of 1844,
but does not know positively whether he and his said
wife were the property and slaves of the said Respondent
or not, but believed at the time that he and his family
were the property of Respondent, but now believes from
what he has heard respondent say since that they were
not the slaves of said Respondent.</p>
<p>That in the spring of 1844, Respondent became very
much embarrased in his pecuniary circumstances, and
determined to emigrate to Oregon. That Respondent
solicited your petitioner and his wife Polly to go with
him to Oregon, and represented to your petitioner that
Oregon was a free country, that slavery did not exist
there, and he did not think it ever would. That Respondent
would take your petitioner and his wife Polly
to Oregon if your petitioner and his said wife would on
Respondents arrival in Oregon, assist said Respondent
to open a farm, and that when your petitioner and wife
had assisted said Respondent as aforesaid your petitioner
and wife Polly and family should be liberated and discharged
absolutely from the service or control of said
Respondent. That your petitioner agreed to proposal of
Respondent as aforesaid and in pursuance of said agreement
came with his wife and said Jenny to Oregon with
said Respondent in the year 1844. That your petitioner
and family continued in the service of Respondent until
the spring of 1849 a period of five years, when your
petitioner requested to be discharged from the service of
said Respondent. That said Respondent desired your
petitioner to go to the Gold mines in California and dig
gold for Respondent, with Respondent's son, Mark Ford,
who was then in California. And that upon the return
of your petitioner, Respondent would comply with his
agreement aforesaid as made in the State of Missouri
and discharge and liberate your petitioner and family
from the service and control of said Respondent, and
further that said Respondent would give your petitioner
a share of the gold that he might dig in California.</p>
<p>That your petitioner desirous of obtaining his family
without difficulty with Respondent, consented to the
proposition of Respondent, and in pursuance of the same</p>
<pb/>
<p>did go to California in the spring of the year 1849 and
 worked in the Gold mines for said Respondent under the
 control and discretion of Mark Ford, aforesaid, until the
 spring of 1850, when he returned to the house of Re
 spondent in Oregon Territory. That during the time
 your petitioner was in California aforesaid, he was in
 formed by said Mark Ford that he your petitioner had
 dug and placed in his (Mark Ford's) for Respondent,
 about the sum of Nine Hundred Dollars in Gold dust.
 That when your petitioner returned in the spring of
 1850 as aforesaid Respondent refused to liberate the
 said Jenny or Mary Jane, Roxanna and James, children
 of your petitioner and his wife Polly, but permitted your
 petitioner and his wife and one infant child of your pe
 titioner to leave the service of said Respondent.
 That your petitioner did not at that or any other
 time make an agreement with said Respondent or any
 one for him, by which said Respondent was to keep said
 minor children and be entitled to their services until they
 became of age or for any period of time, but on the con
 trary claimed that they should be then liberated and de
 livered to your petitioner, and has ever since sought to
 obtain the custody and control of said children.
 Your petitioner further ansers [sic] and says that Re
 spondent has no legal or equitable right to the service or
 control of said minor children. That your petitioner
 does not know whether said Respondent has ever been
 advised to take your petitioner and his family back to
 Missouri and sell them into slavery or not, but he does
 know and states the fact to be that Respondent has often
 threatened so to do, for the purpose of deterring your
 petitioner from seeking to obtain the custody and con
 trol of said children as your petitioner believes.
 That your petitioner is as well able in a pecuniary
 point of view to take care of said and raise said children
 as Respondent, and denies that he is unfit by reason of
 his poverty and ignorance to have the care and custody
 of his own children, but on the contrary avers that his
 character for honesty, society and industry is good, and
 this he prays may be inquired of by the Court.

 Relation of Robin Holmes 
vs.
 Nathaniel Ford 
 Respondent }
Supreme Court
HABEAS CORPUS
 Washington County ss. Nathaniel Ford the respon
 dent in said writ makes the following return thereto to
 wit, That he has the bodies of the said children described
 in said writ in his care and possession and under his con
 trol to wit, in the County of Polk in said Territory.
 That the father and mother of the said children are
 of the African or negro race and were the slaves of and
 owned by the Respondent, for many years in the State
 of Missouri, where the right to hold slaves exists by the
 laws of that State. That the said Jenny, who is now</p>
<pb/>
<p>about twelve years of age, was born in said State of
 Missouri, and whilst the said father and mother were
 the property of this Respondent, and hence the said
 Jenny was the property of this Respondent-That in the
 year 1844 this Respondent brought the said slaves
 father, mother and child, to this territory as his servants
 and property
 That the said James was born in this Territory, in
 February 1845, and the said Roxanna somewhere about
 February 1847-and the said parents of the said children
 were till after the birth of the last mentioned child in
 the possession of this Respondent as his servants and
 slaves, and so continued till in or about the year 1849
 That about the spring of the year 1849 the said Robin
 Holmes the father of the said children left this Terri
 tory and went to California-and the mother of said
 children remained at the residence of this Respondent,
 till the spring of the year 1850, but not controlled as a
 slave.
 That about the first of March 1850 the said Robin
 having returned from California, and his said wife hav
 ing given birth to another child, an agreement was en
 tered into between the said Robin and this Respondent,
 to the effect following, to wit:
 That the said Robin and his wife were to be and
 remain henceforth free-that they were to take their
 youngest child and keep it-And that this Respondent
 was to keep all the rest of the said children (together
 with one which has since died, and which was the oldest
 of the said family of children) and to hold them until
 they respectively became of age according to the laws
 of this Territory, to wit, the males twenty one years of
 age and the females eighteen years of age-to hold them
 not as slaves but as wards.
 That this Respondent has kept the said children at
 a heavy expense while they were young and their service
 of little or no value-A..nd now, since they have arrived
 at an age when their services will be of some benefit the
 Respondent insists that he has a right to retain the said
 children during their minority, as a part compensation
 and remuneration for the expenditures made by him in
 their behalf.
 That this Respondent was advised after it became
 settled that the people would not be permitted to hold</p>
<pb/>
<p>slaves in this territory, to take the said Robin and his
 wife and said children back to Missouri, and there sell
 them-and he might have done so, but chose not to-and
 that from this fact, together with the fact that said
 children have always lived with him this Respondent, he
 the Respondent had reason to believe and did believe that
 the said Relation, Robin, would have abided by his said
 agreement, and left said children with this Respondent
 until they should have become of age as aforesaid.
 And the Respondent insists that he has, not only a
 legal and an equitable right to retain the said children
 in his possession but also that it would be far better for
 said children to be so retained by him the Respondent
 than placed in the hands of the said Robin who is poor
 and ignorant and unfit to have the care and custody and
 bringing up of said children.
 And this Respondent further says that the said chil
 dren have always been well and kindly treated and used
 by the Respondent and his family-But that the said
 Robin is somewhat harsh and his wife is very cruel to
 their children.
 And this Respondent further says he holds said chil
 dren by no other authority than that above set forth.
 And this Respondent further says that proceeding on
 H-abeas Corpus in the above matter was heretofore com
 menced in the District Court for the County of Polk
 wherein the Honorable M. P. Dady and A. G. P. Wood
 Eso. were counsel for the Relation, and the Honorable
 Cyrus Olney and James Malabin were counsel for this
 Respondent and that at the last terms of said District
 Court an issue of fact was formed in said proceeding
 Aind an order was made in said matter by said District
 Court continuing said cause for the purpose of taking
 testimony upon the issue therein raised- And this Re
 spondent then expected that said testimony would have
 been taken and said matter have been decided before this
 time without subjecting him to the additional expense
 ox another similar proceeding.
 And this Respondent further says that he intended
 to have brought the said writ in this cause served on
 him with him to return the same to this Honorable Court,
 and had the same together with other papers which he
 wanted to use at the Surveyor Generals office in his coat
 pocket, but in changing coats he forgot to take out the</p>
<pb/>
<p> said papers and they were thus unintentionally all left at
 the Respondents residence in Polk County aforesaid
 But Respondent believes that the copy of said writ, be
 among the return of B. F. Nichols Sheriff, and is now
 on file in this C-ourt is a true copy of said writ. And the
 Respondent consents that the said copy be in all things
 treated as the original writ.
 And this Respondent further states that it is some
 sixty miles from here to his the Respondents place of
 Residence that the distance was so great and the expense
 which would follow the bringing of said children to this
 place so heavy that the same would have been a great
 hardship upon the Respondent, and the same is the only
 reason why they were not brought here. Anid this Re

 Territory, or even out of said Polk County (unless by

 them (unless by order of the Court) but that they will
 at all times be free at his place of abode aforesaid, unless
 removed without his knowledge or consent, and against
 his will.

 The said Robin Holmes makes solemn oath and says,
 that at the April term of the U. S. District Court within
 and for the County of Polk and Territory of Oregon A.
 D. 1852 a Writ of Habeas Corpus was at that time from
 said Court issued, and made returnable at the next term
 of said Court, commanding one Nathaniel Ford to have
 before said Court on the return day of said Writ, de
 ponents children, Mary Jane, James and Roxanna Holmes
 who were at that time and now are illegally detained and
 restrained of their liberties by said Ford. And deponent
 further says that from causes unknown to him the term
 of said Court last mentioned was never held, and that no
 return was made by said Ford to said writ till April
 term A. D. 1853 of said Court, at which time the cause
 was heard before the Hon. Thos. Nelson, Judge of said
 Court. And deponent further says that the said Thos.
Nelson, after having said cause fully tried refused to give</p>
<pb/>
<p> an opinion or make an order in the case, but said that
 at some future day, not to exceed five weeks, he would
 make an order in the case, which the parties agreed to
 abide. And deponent further says that said order has
 never been made and that the said Nelson has refused
 to make the same. Deponent has been informed and
 verrily believes that said Nelson sent word to deponents
 attorney that he would make no order in the case, but
 would turn it over to his successor to do. Deponent
 further says that neither him nor his wife, the mother
 of said children, are allowed to visit them or hold any
 intercourse whatever with said children, and that al
 though residing within five miles of said Ford, the
 mother of said children has not exchanged a word with,
 nor even seen them for the last two years. Deponent
 further says that he has been informed and verrily be
 lieves, that said For d ill treats Deponent's children, that
 he does nlot furnish them with sufficient mneat, drink or
 apparel and that Deponent is fearful that unless said
 children are placed in a situation that they may be pro
 vided for by their parents, that the treatment that they
 now receive will materially injure their health, and even
 tually cause their death, or be the cause of their enduring
 great suffering. And Denonent further says that he has
 good reasons for believing that it is the intention of said
 Ford to leave this Territory, thalt it is his intention to
 run said children out of the Territory and sell them into
 perpetual slavery, and Deponent verrily believes that
 the furthier detention of said children by said Ford will
 put inn ieopardy their life, liberty and happiness. De
 ponent flherefore asks that h-is said children be put in the
 charge of t3he sheriff of Polk cou.ty, or of some other
 proper person, untill judgment be given on the Writ.

 Mary Jane Holmes, James Holmes, and Roxanna Holmes,
 minors, who are under the age of twenty one years, to
 wit, Mary Jane being about the age of eleven years,
 James about the age of nine years, and Roxanna about
 the age of seven years; that said minors are now im
 prisoned and restrained of their liberties in the county
 of Polk and Territory aforesaid, by one Nathaniel Ford,
 or by some other person, or persons, under the command
 and controll and by the authority of the said Nathaniel
 Ford, against the will and without the consent of the
 said Mary Jane, James, and Roxanna Holmes, as well
 as of your petitioner, that the restraint held over said
 minors by the said Nathaniel Ford is illegal it being
 without the authority of law or the process of any court.
 That your petitioner believes said miinors are imprisoned
 and restrained of their liberties under the pretence that
 slavery is tolerated by the laws of this Territory, and
 that they th;le said Ma,1ry Jane, James and Roxanna are
 the slaves of the said Nathaniiel Ford. Tlhat th-e said
 Nathaniel Ford has for a long series of years held said
 minors under a maost galling and degrading servitude,
 has, and still claims them as his chattles, and that your
 petitioner has been informed and verrily believes that
 the said Nathaniel Ford intends ere long to depart this

 it is the intention of the said Nathaniel Ford to take
 along with him the said minors for the purpose of selling
 them into perpetual slavery in counties beyond the iuri's
 diction of the Courts of this Territory thereby forever
 debarring your petitioner from the pleasure of their so
 ciety, and the benefit to be derived from their services,
 which rightfully belong to him. That your petitioner
 has often made application to the said Nathaniel Ford
 to have the said Mary Jane, James and Roxanna give-n
 up to him, which the said Nathaniel Ford has as o-ten
 refused to do. Wherefore your petitioner prays that
 a writ of Habeas Corpus may be issued to have the bodies</p>

 Holmes, so as aforesaid; and otherwise to do and receive
 what to law and justice doth appertain, and that the

 Robin Holmes
 vs. 
 Nathaniel Ford}
In the matter of a writ of Habeas
Corpus. District Court of the
County of Polk at Chambers.
 Robin Holmes the petitioner in this case respectfully
 shows and states to the Court the following answer to
 said Respondents return to said writ of Habeas Corpus,
 to wit: That sometime in the year 1841, said petitioner
 and his wife Polly were the slaves of Major Whitmore a
 Paymaster as petitioner was informed, in the United
 States Army in Howard County, Missouri, and had been
 the slaves of said Whitmore for the space of twelve years,
 next proceeding said last mentioned date. That some
 time in the year 1841, said petitioner and his wife Polly
 were taken on a writ of execution by said Respondent
 who was then Sheriff of said Howard County, and sold
 at public vender by said Respondent, to satisfy certain
 debts of said Whitmores. That said petitioner and his
 wife Polly were bid off and purchased at said sale by a
 merchant, then resident of said Howard County, whose
 name is not now remembered by your petitioner. That
 the next morning after said sale, Respondent sent your
 petitioner to the house of said purchaser to procure a</p>
<pb/> 
<p>  wagon to take your petitioner and his family to the
 residence of said purchaser. That when your petitioner
 arrived at the house of said purchaser, he was informed
 by the wife of said purchaser that he had gone away to
 purchase goods, and that she knew nothing about the
 aforesaid purchase of your petitioner and wife Polly,
 your petitioner then returned to the house of said Re
 spondent, and informed him of what had transpired at
 the house of said purchaser. That said respondent re
 plied to your petitionier that he, respo-ndent had made
 arn arrangement to keep him and his wife Polly, and to
 rematin with him. That your petitioner and his wife
 Polly serving in the service of said Respondent in How
 ard County aforesaid until the sprilng of 1844, but does
 not know positively whether he and his said wife were
 the property of and slaves of said Respondent or not, but
 believing at the timre that he and his family were the
 property of Respondent, but now believes from what he
 has heard respondent say since, that they were not the
 slaves of said Respondent. That in the spring of 1844,
 Respondent becanme very much embarrased in his pecun
 iary circhumstances aund determined to emigrate to Ore
 gon, that respondent solicited your petitioner and his
 wife Pol,y to go withl him to Oregon, an.d represented to
 your petitioner that Oregon was a free country, that
 slavery did not exist there, and he did not think it ever
 would. That Respondent would take your petitioner
 and his wife Polly to Oregon if your petitioner and his
 said wife would on Respondent's arrival in Oregon assist
 said Resnondent to open a farm and that when your
 petito-ner and wife had assisted said Respo-ndent as
 aforesaid your petitiorner and wifLe Polly and family
 should be liberated and discharged absolutely from the
 service and controll of said Respondent. That your
 petitioner agreed to oroposal of Respondent as aforesaid,
 and in pursuance of said agreement came with his wife
 and said Mary Jane to Oregon, wirth said Respondent in
 the year 1844. Thcat your petitioner and family con
 tinued in the service of Respondent until the spring of
 1849, a period of five years, when your petitioner request
 ed to be discharged from the service of said Respondent.
 that said Respondent refused to let your petitioner and
 family go Lree, but dlesired your petitioner to go to the
 Gold mines in California and dig gold for Respondent</p>
<pb/>
<p>with Respondents son, Mark Ford, who was then in
 California, and that upon the return of your petitioner,
 Respondent would comply with his agreement aforesaid
 as made in Missouri and discharge and liberate your
 petitioner and family from the service and control of
 said Respondent, and further that said respondent would
 give your petitioner a portion of the gold that he might
 dig in California. That your petitioner desirous of ob
 taining his family without difficulty with Respondent
 consented to the proposition of Respondent's and in pur
 suance of the same did go to California in the spring of
 the year 1849 and worked in the gold mines for said
 Respondent under the control and authority, or direction,
 of Mark Ford aforesaid until the spring of 1850, when
 he returned to the house of Respondent in Oregon Ter
 ritory, That during the time your petitioner was in
 California aforesaid, he was informed by said Mark
 Ford, that he your petitioner had dug and placed in his
 Mark Ford's hands, for Respondent about the sum of
 Nine hundred dollars in gold dust, besides cooking for
 the mess to which he your petitioner belonged.
 That when your petitioner returned in the spring of
 1850, as aforesaid, Respondent in violation of good con
 science and the contract as afore said, refused to liberate
 the said Mary Jane, Roxanna, and James, children of
 your petitioner and his wife Polly, but permitted your
 petitioner and his wife and one infant child of your
 petitiorner to leave the service of said Respondent, that
 your petitioner did not at that or any other time make
 an agreement with said Responderit or any one for him,
 by which said Respondent was to keep said minor chil
 dren and be entitled to their service until they became of
 age, or for any period of time, but on the contrary
 claimed that they should be then liberated and delivered
 to your petitionner, and has ever since sought to obtain
 the custody and control of said children.
 Your petitioner further answers and says. that said
 Respondent, has no legal or equitable right to the service
 or control of said minor children. That your petitioner
 does not know whether said Respondent has ever been
 advised to take your petitiorner and his family back to
 Missouri and sell them into slavery or not, but he does
 know and states the fact to be that Respondent has often
 threatened to so do, for the purpose of detering your</p>
<pb/>
<p>petitioner from seeking to obtain the custody and control
 of said children, as your petitioner believes.
 That your petitioner is as well able in a pecuniary
 point of view to take care of and raise said children as
 Respondent, and denies that he is unfit by reason of his
 poverty and ignorance to have the care and custody of
 his own children and further denies that he is harsh, or
 that his wife Polly is cruel to their children, but on the
 contrary avers that his and his wife's reputation for
 kindness and parental care for their children is such
 that he can safely ask the Court to enquire thereof, and
 that his character for honesty sobriety and industry is
 good as petitioner believes, and this he prays may be in
 quired of by the Court.
