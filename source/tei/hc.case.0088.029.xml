<p>Q. Have you known her pretty intimately the last two or three years, or since she and her husband separated? A. Yes, I have been better acquainted since then than I was before.</p>

<p>Q. What has been her general conduct, her general demeanor and her business since she and her husband separate? A. Well I have been past there---I have some land near there, and have been down there to see that several times in the last year. I found her washing and ironing and sewing, around <sic>thehouse</sic>.</p>

<p>Q. Is she an industrious or lazy woman? A. She is industrious woman, a hard working woman.</p>

<p>Q. Always seems busy? A. Yes sir.</p>

<p>Q. How do they appear, do they appear to be well dressed, well kept? A. Yes sir.</p>

<p>Q. They are comfortably dressed, not rich but comfortably cloathed.</p>

<p>Q. Do you think from what you know of her, do you consider her a fit and proper person to take care of her own children.</p>

<p>A. I do, to take care of her own.</p>

<p>Q. You would consider her a proper person and morally fit person, would you not to care for and instruct and take care of her own children? A. I consider her as good as the average woman in her <del/> circumstances.</p>

<p>Q. What do you mean by her circumstances? A. Poor and have but little money--working and making a good living.</p>

<p>Q. That is the only draw back that you consider against her? A. That is all.</p>

<p>Q. Is she living an honest upright life? A. I dont know, only what I see.</p>

<p>Q. Is that the appearances she presents to you and is that the reputation she bears now? A. Well, both appearances and reputation that I get abroad.</p>

<p>Q. That she is leading an honest and industrious life? A. Yes sir. Much better now than when living with McKay.</p>

<p>Q. Is it not a fact that her husband caused her to do what she did do? A. That is what I supposed, I was not at the house a great deal then, but I heard it

said from others that he was the cause of it.</p>

<p>Q. Did you ever hear her charged with living in adultery with any man?? A. No.</p>

<p>Q. From what you know of her do you believe that she would do that?</p>

<p>GILMAN. We object.</p>

<p>A. I have no reason to believe she would any more than any other woman.</p>

<p>Q. You dont believe that she would be guilty of that from what you know of her and see her? A. I do not.</p>

<p>The COURT: How close do you live to her? A. I live two miles and a half. I have some land that I go down occasionally to sell lots from.</p>

<p>CROSS-EXAMINATION:</p>

<p>Q. [Gilman] How frequently do you see her? A. Oh, I see her some six or eight times a year.</p>

<p>Q. She might have been drunk five times a month and you not know it? A. She might have been drunk out of my sight and I not know it.</p>

<p>Q. She might have been living in adultery with a man and you not know it? A. Of course.</p>

<p>Q. Who did you ever <del/> hear say that she lead an honest upright life?</p>

<p>A. I have heard several speak of her since McKay left.</p>

<p>Q. Is not this what was said, that she had done better since McKay left? A. Yes that is it.</p>
