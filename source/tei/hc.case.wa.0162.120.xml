hallway and some one leaning
over him    I ran down to the star

</p>

<p>
I was in the Bar room in the
California I House standing
close to the side door a the
west when I heard the shot
</p>

<p>
Then I ran <unclear>diagonill</unclear> across
the street and was within 20
feet when I saw the light in
the star building  I spoke to
some one in the California house
as I ran out    when I saw
the light in the star building and
not see any one coming seems
to me I did see some one on
the street but do not know who it
was   saw no one ahead of me
some one behind me   Door
was entirely ajar when I saw the
light in the star building the door
of the <add>building</add> <del>man</del> was entirely ajar the Mans
Body would prevent it from closing
</p>

<p>When I first saw the door ajar
saw the same person was leaning
over him as when I arrived at

<pb/>


at the door    It was the defendant
something less than a minute elapsed
after I heard the shot until I got there
The deft was asking some one to
bring watter or why they did not bring
water   She seemed in the act of
trying to give relief to the man
she was excited and was <unclear>wringing</unclear>
her hands and asked me if he was
hurt and said she had shot at him
but did not think she had hurt him
</p>

<p>
She adressed me first and asked
him afterwards a couple of minutes
afterwards when I told her she had
shot him she told me she did not
intend to shoot him she was trying
get some one to give him some whiskey
so as to revive him  Shortly after
I got there I think one of the Girls
from the House brought some water the
first thing after I got there I asked
her what was the trouble and she
replied that she shot at him or the
man <unclear>I can not share whether she said</unclear>
him or the man – His head laying the
outer N. E. corner, on his back with his
face up his head pressed forward <unclear>by</unclear>
the wall one of his legs one way &amp; one doubled
up – <unclear>Bureau Set</unclear>
</p>

<p>
She said after told her she had
shot the man O. My God have I
shot him  She showed considerable
feeling


<pb/>


threw up her hands and began
crying going from one room to
the other – all she had to do was
to go from <del>one room</del> <add>the hall</add> to the <del>other</del> <add>adjoining room</add> to get
whiskey   I followed nearly all the
time she did not try to get away
she was very much excited and <unclear/>
did not make any effort to escape
was about 2 to 4 minutes – before I
got <del>to do</del> the Revolver The First thing
I <unclear>and been</unclear> <del>to do</del> <add>look</add> to see if the man
was hurt when I got up from the man
I asked for the Revolver   She was
standing just on the inside of the door
in the middle Parlor I asked  her for
the Revolver she says here it is and
took it from somewhere in her dress
</p>

<p>I was on the left side of the body
when I got up to get the Revolver – she
could see me in a the body of the
man  This occupied only a few
minutes   She told me this a few
minutes after, she told me she asked
him to get out he replied he would
not go out, Did not at that or
any other time <add>before the coroner inquest</add> tell me that he said 
he be D–D if he would go out
</p>

<p>
I did not swear before the coroner
Jury that she told me that she told
told him to go out and he said he be D–D
if he would go out  I am trying


<pb/>

to give her exact words <del>and there if</del>
I told him to go out were all the
words I informed it was the outside
door that was referred to <add>that she was inside the door </add> She has said
he struck at her from what I
understood he only struck at her once
before she got the revolver</p>

<p>I did not swer before the Grand
Jury that she said he struck at her
twice before she got the revolver,
she
said she got the revolver from
a drawer in her <add>bureau in her</add> room she said
she came back and ordered him out
again he then struck at her and
she then raised the revolver and
fired did not say he struck her
 on the right shoulder did not swear
so before coroner jury
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
No one arrived
at the scene with me some one
came in about a minute I think Mr
Lynch helped me to open his shirt
and examine the wound and was
inside the vestibule with me he <add>Lynch</add> was
a small man with dark moustache
I tried to keep people out I did
not close the outer door, after the
door was closed I tried to keep
People out say <unclear>5 or less</unclear> minutes
When I got there I saw no one but
Ray in the Hall saw one of the
Girls think it was Ruby Stanley
in the middle parlor door.
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
had seen the man that was killed
before about Mr Barnes place at the door going in or in about
half our before Barnes place is a saloon at that time I was
<del>going into B</del> coming out of Banres
he was going in I noticed he 
was a stranger in the place paid
no particular attention to him
</p>

<p>
He was not drinking when I
saw him but had the appearance
of having been drinking acted
as though he had a little aboard
</p>

<p>
I saw him on the street just before
dark was in a crowd some three <unclear>but</unclear>
did not know them, know Johnny
Maybiss by sight Do not know
whether he had been with the man
before he was murdered <unclear></unclear> heard
he was  I <unclear>subpoenaed</unclear> him 
to appear at this examination on the
part of the Territory the same
</p>

<p>
I have told all as far as I <unclear>remember</unclear>
about the case
</p>

<p>
ReDirect
</p>

<p>
The mans coat was new the front clean
did not see the back    should Judge the overalls
&amp; shirt had been worn some time and
were soiled   I was the first man that
reached the house after I heard the shot
I saw at the house Defedant and
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
Ruby Stanley Defendant mentioned the Girl
and herself said there were two Gentlemen
in the middle parlor drinking together
</p>

<p>
Pub hall <add>about</add> 4 feet Deft
Body extended nearly to the outer door
foot to inner door body nearly in hall</p>

<p>When I first got there she was
<del>wringing</del> swinging her hands over him after
I told her the man was shot she manifested
considerable feeling  Her demeanor
was after the manner of one very much
excited She related circumstances four
times   I stated an first examination twice
varied such time added to each
time she told it    I believe that the
last couple of times she told <add>it</add> she was more cool about did not cry cannot tell
what new facts she told except it
was little different than before    Hall
was lighted when I looked down after the 
shot    Believe the south <add>hall</add> is the customary
entrance but they use both
</p>

<p>ReCross</p>
<p>
I know the character of the House
House is a house of public character
one that gentlemen frequent at all
times of the night      Suppose they ask
for permission to enter if door is
closed they cannot enter without asking
when I go I ring the bell each time
she told a little more <add>that is added a little more to the story</add> she swooned
that night, third &amp; fourth recital after
swooning     after I got there saw
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
Ruby Stanley &amp; Ray only</p>

<p>I told her when the man was 
dead these accounts were told by
her before I told her man was dead
</p>

<p>ReDirect</p>

<p>
She was swooning about three minutes
she threw up her hands <unclear>gave way</unclear>
and did not seem to have conciousness
when she came to she came to she went from room
to room     She swooned after I told
her I must arrest her some 5 minutes
she swooned on the Road to Mr Glispies
<del>and</del>
</p>

<p>ReCross</p>

<p>
<del>I dont know</del> Dont know the
immediate cause of swooning, aid
was given her to recover from a swoon
by putting water in her face
</p>

<p>ReDirect</p>

<p>
Saw the body of the man after he
was dead and know he was dead
Transactions I have described took
place –  Spokane Falls, <add>Spokane County</add> Wash TY
</p>

<p>
I would say the man
when I saw him before this occurance
was under the influence of liquor
seemed to be very quiet and peacable
</p>

<p>
Think there is a Bell on the door at the
North Hall
</p>

<p>ReCross</p>

<p>
No one called my attention to
the man in the afternoon</p>
