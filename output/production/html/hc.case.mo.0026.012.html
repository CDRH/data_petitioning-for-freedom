      <p class="tei_p">Hannah Lee being duly sworn on her oath saith—that some day 
last week Mrs Placket told her that whenever the girl now present made her angry 
she threw her on the fire and would do so again—that she saw 
Mr Placket take a broom handle and beat the said girl over the head 
&amp; that she also saw Mrs Placket do the same at a different time—that she saw 
the girl with a rope round her neck and Mrs Placket pulling her 
down stairs--</p>
