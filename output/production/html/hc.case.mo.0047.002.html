Missouri</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your Petitioner Joseph W Loan respectfully represents that he is and for a long time past has 
been the owner of a slave named Eleck Loan

County Gaol on or about the 25th day of October 
A.D. 1856 by the commitment of Peter W Johnstone 
a Justice of the Peace as a Runaway slave, in 
the information of one Hugh L White, that said 
slave is now held in confinement against his 
will and the will of your petitioner by one <del> John </del> Robert 
F Logan keeper of the said County Gaol of 
Saint Louis County, Missouri. Your Petitioner 
states that he is a resident of Platte County 
in the state of Missouri, and that his said 
slave Eleck Loan is not a runaway slave 
but that his said slave Eleck had full and legal

to the City of Saint Louis Missouri. Your petitioner 
therefore prays that a writ of Habeas Corpus may 
be issued by your Honourable Court returnable 
forthwith requiring said <del> John </del> Robert F Logan keeper 
of the Saint Louis County Gaol to appear 
before your Honorable Court with the 
person of the said Eleck Loan, to inquire 
into the cause of the detention of the said 
Eleck Loan, slave as aforesaid and belonging 
to your Petitioner and to grant the said Eleck 
Loan his discharge and his delivery to your 
Petitioner according to Law</p>

the above petition and the matters therein as 
stated are true</p>
