    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Frank O'Neill, Dave Gillinsky, A.F. Pirson, Art Williams, and William Larsen, were arrested for reportedly breaking and entering into the home of Katherine C. Allisen and her daughter, Grace Allisen on 410 S. 39th St. on December 5, 1919 around 2 AM. They were taken into custody, held on bonds of $2,000 each, the same day at the Electric Garage on 40th and Farnam, where they stopped to repair their car. Upon searching their car, police officer Fred H. Peterson found three loaded guns and a crowbar. The men claimed that none of the guns were theirs and that the crowbar was only in the car to aid in changing tires. The men claimed that they were on their way to Benson, an Omaha neighborhood, to play cards with a friend of Dave Gillinsky's. On that same morning, the five men were taken back to the Allisens' house, but Katherine was unable to positively identify any of them, and she in fact said that one of the policemen bore a stronger similarity to the man she saw than any of the accused men.  A preliminary hearing occurred on December 6 in front of police magistrate Charles E. Foster. In this trial, all of the men claimed alibis for the night of Thursday, December 4 and Friday, December 5. All of the men were out drinking in downtown Omaha, and several witnesses, including friends of theirs and employees of establishments they visited, testified that the men were with them that night. Notably, it came out in the trial that William Earl Adams, the Allisens' neighbor, had heard someone yell "Harold" during the robbery&#x2014;none of the men were named Harold. In addition, the mens' lawyer, John Battin, pointed out that the short coat that was the most recognizable attribute of the man that Mrs. Allisen saw was in fact a coat that had been issued to every man honorably discharged from the navy, and thus would have been a common sight only a year after WWI. Thus, the men filed a habeus corpus petition on December 18, 1919, which was allowed. A hearing on the petition occured on December 19, but it was denied on the 22nd. This is perhaps because another habeus corpus petition the men filed, also against Michael L. Clark, had succeeded, allowing all of the men except Larson, for an unknown reason, to be freed. A return to writ was filed on December 27, 1919. An Omaha Daily Bee article indicates that Frank O'Neill was arrested for another robbery on January 24, 1920, and that somehow, the men were tried again and found guilty for the the Allison robbery on March 29, 1920. This was reversed and remanded, however, by the Nebraska Supreme Court on March 26, 1921. </li>
