<p>In the matter of the application of George

<p>To the Hon. C. H. Hanford, chief justice of the Territory of Washington; and Judge of the District Court of the Third Judicial District: The petitioner, George W. Anderson, respectfully shows:</p>

<p>That the said imprisonment, detention, confinement and restraint are illegal, and that the illegality therof consists in this, to wit: That the said imprisonment, detention, confinement and restraint are without due process of law.</p>

<p>That your petitioner was arrsted on or about the 1st day of October, 1889, upon an informattion alleging that he was in this Territory, and charged with the commission of a crime in the state of Oregon, and he was arrested by virtue of a warrant making the same allegations, said information being sword to by said J.

Miller, Esq., a Justice of the Peace in and for the precinct of Seaettle in said county of King, a prelimi-</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>mary hearing was had, based on said <del></del> information and warrant and afrest of your petitioner therunder; that at such hearing your petitioner was held by the said Justice of the Peace, and in default of bail committed to the custody of said J. C.</p>

<p>Mitchell and said John H. McGraw, and confined under said committment, in the county jail of said King County. That the said commitment of the said Justice of the Peace was illegal and void in this: That it was issued pursuant to the judgment of said Justice of the Peace of said preliminary hearing, which said judgment was based solely on testimony wholly incompetent and inadmissible in law, being hearsay testimony only, being statements contained in telegrams sent to the Chief of Police of the City of Seattle, by the Chief of Police of the City of Portland, in the State of Oregon; that there was no other testimony offered whatsoever: and that further the testimony of said J.C. Mitchell, said Chief of Police of the said City of Seattle, who made the complaint upon which the said warrant for the arrest of your petitioner was issued as aforesaid was that he had no personal knowledge of the facts alleged in the same complaint; and that said complaint was based solely upon the receipt by him of telegrams as aforesaid, from the said Chief of Police of the said City of Portland.</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays that a writ of habeas corpus may be directed to the said J. C. Mitchell and John H. McGraw, commanding them to have the body of your petitioner before your honor at the time and place therein to be specified, and which time <del>and place</del> your petitioner prays may be forthwith, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered by your honor concerning him, together with the time and <del>place</del></p>
<pb></pb>

<p>cause of his detention under said writ; and that he may be restored to his liberty.</p>

<p>And your petitioner further prays that a writ of certiorari may issue out of said District Court for the Third Judical District of Washington Territory, to the said John F. Miller, said Justice of the Peace, commanding him to forthwith transmit to the Clerk of said District Court, the record of the proceedings on said hearing herein, had as aforesaid on the said 2nd day of October, 1889.</p>
