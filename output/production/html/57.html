    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Hugo Peters submitted this petition stating that he was being unlawfully deprived of his liberty by John J. Ryder, Henry W. Dunn, and Michael Dempsey. His petition stated that on 26 August 1913, Peters was &#x201C;forcibly brought&#x201D; before Samuel L. O&#x2019;Brien. The petition claimed that O&#x2019;Brien was pretending to hold Police Court and was claiming to be the Magistrate of said Court. Petitioner was then forcibly subjected to a &#x201C;pretended trial in said pretended Police Court.&#x201D; Peters stated that Fred W. Anheuser, the City Prosecutor, appeared and conducted a &#x201C;pretended prosecution&#x201D; for the pretended charges of carrying concealed weapons and using profane language over a phone. O&#x2019;Brien then sentenced Peters to 30 days in City Jail for each of the two charges. The petition stated that no complaint was ever filed in either of the &#x201C;pretended&#x201D; prosecutions charging Peters with any crimes or misdemeanors under Nebraska State Laws or Omaha City Ordinances. The word &#x201C;pretended&#x201D; is used because no complaint was ever filed for either charge. Because of this, the aforementioned parties had no authority to charge Peters with either crime or detain him to City Jail. The Appearance Docket stated that the writ was dismissed on 24 December 1913.</li>
