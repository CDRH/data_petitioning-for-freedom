<head>WANTS TO QUIT</head>
<p>Senator J. Hamilton Lewis, in whom Seattle holds an interest because it was here that he set out upon his political journey, would like to quit his job. he says he wants to resign to devote more time to his family and his private affairs but that loyalty to the President may keep him on the job until 1940, three years before his term as senator from Illinois expires. For more than forty years Senator Lewis has been actively engaged in political activities at the national capital, and it is no wonder that he now wishes to quit. But even so, this sort of impulse is unique. The U.S. senator, as a rule, hangs on until Father Time comes along. Senator Lewis is to be congratulated for having served so long without a breakdown, in the midst of the turmoil and turbulence of the situation. He must still be blessed with a remakrably well balanced disposition even in his old age.</p>
