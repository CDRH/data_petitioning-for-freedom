<p>In the District Court of Washington
Territory and for the Fourth Judicial District
thereof holding terms at Spokane Falls.</p>

<p>The Territory of Washington
vs.
Ray Raymond
Territory of Washington
County of Spokane}ss</p>

<p>N.T. Caton being first
duly sworn deposes and says that he
is an attorney as stated pacticing as
such at Spokane Falls and has
been employed by defendant as
one of her attorneys in the trial of
the above entitled case. That
he came to reside in said Spokane 
Falls in the latter part of June lest
that upon his arrival at said place
he heard numerous persons and
many of them, men of business and
prominence express themselves in
strong terms of disapprotation of
defendant in relation to the offense
wiht which she stands charged
that expressions were used that lead
applicant to believe that scarcely
a citizen can be found in said

<pb/>

city but was ready to condemn
said defendant for the offense
of which she was accused.
Applicant says it is impossible
to give the precise language 
used ot the times that be
heard the same that the accusations
were so frequent that from the time
he arrived here and continued
down to the day of election
Nov. 2, 1886 and the persons
so expressing themselves so
numerous it would be impossible
to state either the one or the 
other, and applicant says
he firmly believes and
respecting by states the same
that forms the disaster of these
expressions and the frequency
of their repetition and from
the state of prejudice and
excitement they evidence that
defendant cannot have a
fair and impartial trial of
her said cause in Spokane 
County.</p>
