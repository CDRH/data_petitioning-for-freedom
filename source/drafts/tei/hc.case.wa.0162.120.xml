close to the side door a the
west when I heard the shot
</p>

<p>
Then I ran <unclear>downhill</unclear> across
the street and was with 20
feet when I saw the light in
the slut building  I spoke to
some one in the California house
as I ran out    when I saw
the light in the slut building and
not see any one coming seem
to me I did see some one on
the street but do not know who it
was   saw no one ahead of seen
some one behind me   Door
was entirely ajar when I saw the
light in the slut building the door
of the <add>body</add> <del>man</del> was entirely ajar the Mans
Body would prevent it from doing
</p>

<p>When I first saw the door ajar
saw the same person was leaning
over him as when I arrived at</p>

<pb/>

<p>
at the door    It was the defendant
something less than a minute <unclear>spared</unclear>
after I heard the shot until I got there
The deft was asking some one to
bring watter or why the did not bring
water   She seemedin the act of
trying to give relief to the man
she was excited and was <unclear>laughing</unclear>
her head and asked me of he was
hurt and said she had shot at him
but did not think she had hurt him
</p>

<p>
She adressed me first and asked
him of towards a couple of minutes
afterwords when I told hershe had
shot him she told me she did not
instead to shoot him she was trying
get some one to give him some whiskey
so as to revive him  Shortly after
I got there I think one of the Girls
from the House brought some water the
first thing after I got there I asked
her what was the trouble and she
replied that she shot at him or the
man <unclear>I seen not shot what the she said</unclear>
him or the man - His head laying the
only N. E. corner, on his back with his
face up his ehad pressed forward <unclear></unclear>

<p>
She said after stated her she had
shot the man O. My God have I
shot him  She showed considerable
feeling
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
threw up her hands and began
crying going from one room to
the other - all she had to do was
to go from <del>one room</del> <add>the hall</add> to the <del>other</del> <add>adjourning room</add> to get
whiskey   I followed near all the
time she did not by to get any

got <del>to do</del> the Revolver The First thing
I and been <del>to do</del> <add>look</add> to see if the man
was hurt when I got up from the man
I asked for the Revolver   She was
standing just on the inside of the door
in the middle Parlor I asked  her for
the Revolver she says here it is and
took it from somewhere in her dress
</p>

<p>
I was on the left side of the body
when I got up to get the Revolver- she
could see me in an a the body of the
man  This occupied only a few
minutes   She told me this a few
minutes after, she told me she asked
him to get out he replied he would
not go out, did not at that or
any other time <add>before the coroner <unclear></unclear> </add> tell me that he said 
he be <unclear>dead</unclear> if he would go out
</p>
<p>
I did not swear before the coroner
Jury that she told me that she had
told him to go out and he said he be <unclear>dead</unclear>
if he would go out  I am trying
</p>

<pb/>
<p>

I told him to go out were all their
words I referred it was the outside
door that was referred to <add>that she was inside the door </add> She has said
he struck at her from what I
understood he only struck at her
 and before she got the revolver, she
said she got the revolver from
a drawer in her <add>Burnam in her</add> hand she said
she came back and ordered him out
again he then struck at her and
she then raised the revolver and
fired did not say he struck her
 on the right shoulder did not swear
