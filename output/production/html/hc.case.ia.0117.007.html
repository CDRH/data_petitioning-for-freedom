      <p class="tei_p">Toledo, Iowa, Nov 25th 1899.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">HON,-Judge Shiras Des Moines IOWA,-</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Kind Sir,-</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Mr Wilcox of Montour in this county has already consulted with you in regard to the enclosed matter, Now if you shall be detained at Des Moines long enough, I prefer you shall fix the return and hearing at the Federal Court room at Des Moines Iowa if not at Cedar-Rapids. In regard to the confined petitioner, LELAH-PUC-KA-CHEE, you suggested she need not be braught before you at the time of hearing, but really Judge I prefer you make the order that she be braught, because I shall want her testimony as to her treatment and also her marriage, and cannot get her attendance very well in any other manner. You notice I have prepared the enclosed petition asking for a preliminary writ instead of the ordinary writ because I believe the facts alleged justify the former, if however you think otherwise then issue simply the ordinary writ, I suggest Mr Healy U,S, Marshall of Cedar-Rapids, be named by you in your order to serve the writ.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">YOURS VERY RESPECTFULLY</p>
