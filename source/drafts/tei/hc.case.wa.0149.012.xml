<ab>IN THE <del>DISTRICT</del> Circuit COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
IN AND FOR THE <add>Ninth Circuit</add> <del>DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON,</del>
NORTHERN DIVISION.</ab>

<ab>In the Matter of the Application
of Lee Fong for a Writ 
of Habeas Corpus.</ab>

<ab>No. 2333</ab>

<ab>BRIEF of Respondent,</ab>

<p>In this case, Lee Fong is charged with having violated
Section 6 of Ordinance No. 710 of the City of Seattle, 
entitled "An ordinance regulating the establishment and 
maintenance of public laundries and public wash-houses within
the limites of the City of Seattle," Sections 2, 3 and 6
of said ordinance reasing as follows:</p>

<p>"Sec.2. It shall be unlawful for any person or 
persons to conduct or maintain a public laundry or washhouse 
within the city of Seattle without having first obtained 
a certificate signed by the health officer of the
City of Seattle that the premises are properly and sufficiently
drained and that all proper arrangements for carrying on
the business without injury to the sanitary condition of the
neighborhood have been complied with, also a certificate
signed by the chief of the fire department of the City of
Seattle that the stoves, washing and drying apparatus and 
the applicances for heating smoothing irons are in good condition,
and that their use is not dangerous to the surrounding
property from fire, and that all proper precautions have
been taken to comply with the provisions of the ordinances
of the city then in force making regulations concerning the
erection and use of buildings and for the protection of property</p>

<pb/>

<p>from injury or destruction by fire.</p>

<p>"Sec.3. It shall be the duty of the health officer, 
also of the chief of the fire department, respectively,
upon application from any person or persons proposing to
open or conduct the business of a public laundry within the 
City of Seattle to inspect the premises in which it is proposed 
to carry on said business, or in which said business
is being carried on, with a view to ascertain whether the
said premises are provided with proper drainage and sanitary 
appliances, also whether the provisions of the ordinances of
the city then in force making regulations concerning the
erection and use of building and for the protection of 
property from injury or destruction by fire, have been complied 
with, and if found in all respects satisfactory, then
to issue to such person or persons the certificates provided
for in section 2 of this ordinance. No charge whatever
shall be made or compensation or fee collected or received 
for the performance of any of the services required by the
provisions of this ordinance in the inspection of premises
or the issuance of a certificate, but all such services 
shall be performed free of charge."</p>

<p>"Sec. 6. It shall be unlawful, from and after 
the passage of this ordinance, for any person or persons to
establish, maintain or carry on a laundry within the corporate
limits of the City of Seattle, without having first
obtained the consent of the common council, except the same
be located in a building constructed either of brick or 
stone and covered with a metal roof."</p>

<p><del>And</del> The complaint upon which the defendant is held is based
upon Section 6 of said ordinances, the charges part of which 
reads as follows:</p>

<pb/>
<p>"Then and there being the said defendant, Lee
Fong, did wilfully and unlawfully, at Number 1410 Fir 
Street,in said City of Seattle, establish, maintain and
carry on a laundry within the corporate limits of the said 
City of Seattle and at said place, without first obtaining
the consent of the City Council of said City, the said laundry
not being located in a building constructed either of 
brick, stone, nor covered with a metal roof."</p>

<p>Our position in this matter is, that these 
sections should be, and necessarily are, construed together, 
and that, when so construed and understood, this case is taken
entirely out of the question of arbitrary power as laid 
down in the case of Yick Wo v. Hopkins 118 U.S. 356.
The City Council, after investigating the reports of the
Chief of the Fire Department and the Health Officers, will,
in all cases, grant a permit to conduct a laundry if the reports 
are correct, and if the conduct of the laundry under
all the circumstances is not dangerous to the public health
or to surrounding property. This is not a mere arbitrary
power, but the Council takes its recommendation from the
Chief of the Fire Department and the Health Officer and uses
in a discretionary power as to granting the permit, rather
than an arbitrary power referred to in the case above. "Regulations
respecting the pursuit of lawful trades and businesses 
are of very frequent occurrence in the various cities 
of the country, and what such regulations shall be, and to
what particular trade, business, or occupation they shall
apply, are questions for the State to determine, and their
determination comes within the proper exercise of the police
power of the State, and unless the regulations are so utterly</p>

<pb/>

<p>unreasonable and extravagant in their nature and purpose that
the property and personal rights of the citizen are unnecessarily,
and in a manner wholly arbitrary, interfered with or 
destroyed without due process of law, they do not extend beyond 
the power of the State to pass, and they form no subject
for Federal interference." This rules is laid down and promulgated
in the case of Harry Gundling vs. The City of Chicago 177
U.S. Page 633. This is a case relating to persons selling cigarettes.
A portion of Section 1 of the ordinance of Chicago reads as 
follows:</p>

<p>"Any person, firm or corporation desiring a license
to sell cigarettes shall make written application for
that purpose to the commissioner of health, in which shall
be described the location at which such sales are proposed 
to be made. Said application shall be accompanied by evidence
that the applicant, if a single individual, all the members
of the firms, if a copartnership, and person or persons in
charge of the business, if a corporation, is or are persons
of good character and reputation. The commissioner of health
shall thereupon submit to the mayor the said application
with the evidence aforesaid, with his opinion as to the propriety
of granting such license, and if the mayor shall be
satisifed that the persons before mentioned are of good
character and reputation, and are suitable persons to be intrusted 
with the sale of cigarettes, he shall issue a license 
in accordance with such application."</p>

<p>The ordinance in the case at bar does not grant to 
the City Council of the City of Seattle any more arbitrary
power than is granted in this ordinance, when our ordinance
is properly construed with Sections 2 and 3. In the Chicago
case, the Court said that "the ordinance in question here</p>

<pb/>
<p>does not grant to the mayor arbitrary power such as is described
in the above-mentioned laundry case, but the provisions
is similar to that mentioned in the foregoing extract
from the opinion in that case. In the case at bar, the license 
is to be issued if the mayor is satisified that the person
applying is of good character and reputation and a suitable 
person to be intrusted with the sale of cigarettes."</p>

<p>In this case at bar, the permit is to be granted 
if the City Council finds that all suitable arrangements have
been made for conducting a laundry, but not otherwise. </p>

<p>While this is not the language of Section 6 under 
which the defendant is being prosecuted, it is the clear and 
evident intention when the ordinance is construed as a whole. 
We see, in the first place, that a permit must be had from
the Chief of the Fire Department as well as the Health Officer
of the City, <add>in all cases,</add> but this is not sufficient in cases where
laundries are to be erected and operated in buildings not of 
brick or stone nor metal roofs. In <del>all other</del> these cases, the certificates
must be had, and as well as the certificates, a 
permite form the City Council. Should the buildings not of 
brick or stone nor covered with metal roofs be found to be 
suitable and comply with all the ordinances of the City and 
proper permits granted by the Chief of the Fire Department
and the Health Officer, there would be little discretion
left for the City Council, and should the Council act in an arbitrary
manner after these permits were granted, the Courts
would not uphold their action. There is no question of the 
right of municipalities to pass ordinances to control businesses
of this character in looking to the protection of property
and persons. </p>

<pb/>

<p>The Statute of Washington, as found in Subdivision
22 of Section 739 of 1 Ballinger's Code, in relation to powers 
of cities of the first class concerning the construction 
of buildings and the regulation and management of occupations 
carried on therein, reads as follows:</p>

<p>"22. To direct the location and construction of 
all builings in which any trade or occupation offensive to 
the senses or deleterious to public health or safety shall
be carried on, and to regulate the management thereof; and 
to prohibit the erection or maintenance of such buildings or 
structures, or the carrying on of such trades or occupation
within the limits of such corporation, or within the distance 
of two miles beyond the boundaries thereof."</p>

<p>We contend that, under this statute, the City of 
Seattle has full power and authority to enact and enforce
such ordinance as the one in issue in the case at bar. </p>

<p>While there are certain questions of fact in the
petition of Lee Fong for the writ of habeas corpus, all matters
and things of that character have been by agreement 
eliminated, and this matter is submitted strictly and only 
upon the constitutionality of the ordinance under which the 
said Lee Fong is being prosecuted. It is our contention
that this ordinance goes no farther and attempts to do nothing
more than the one in the Chicago case relating to the sale of 
cigarettes, and we insist, that the ordinance is valid.</p>
