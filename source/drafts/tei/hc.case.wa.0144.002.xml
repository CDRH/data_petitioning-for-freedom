Whreupon and on said date said
Jusict served a warraant, to said
R.J. Rush for the arrest of your

and thereafter and on the writ the said
27th day of November A.D. 1885
said City Marshall James Glispon
returned with said warrant to said
Justice that he had arrested said defend-
ant under said warrant and had
him there in writ.
That the further hearing of saif mat-
ter was by said Justice postponed until
the 10th day of December A.D. 1885 at
the hour of ten o'clock A.M.
That on said date defendant moved
the court to discharge here for the 
reasons that said Justice had no 
Jurisdiction to was said warrant
and that the same was wholly void and
that said Justice has no authority or
Jurisdiction to within defendant in
custody.
That said motion was overruled and
said Justice thou proceeded to exam-
ine your petitioner as to the <del>affidavit
aforesaid and</del> matters and things 
set out in said affidavit; and
amongst other evidence heard by
said justice was the pretended ordinance of
said city hereafter referred to and

out; to the consideration of which
ordinance defendant then and there
objected; that thereafter and on the 
10th day of December A.D. 1885

and costs of said proceeding as
hereinbefore mentioned, and to
stand committed until the same

tioned was issued.
Your petitioner further represents 
that the pretended ordinance of said city of
Spokane Falls above mentioned and
which was referred to in the affida-
vit aforementioned of R.J. Rush
and which was considered by said
Justice in said hearing is in words
and figures following to wit:
An ordinance prohibiting the smoking
or inhaling of opium.
As it ordained by the City of Spokane Falls.
Sec. 1 No person or persons shall keep a 
house, cellar or place within the limits of
the city of Spokane Falls, in whcih such
person or persons or any other person
or persons smoke or inhale opium.

Sec. 2- No person or persons shall
smoke or inhale opium in any such
house, cellar or place or visit such
house, cellar or place for the purpose
of smoking or inhaling opium.

Sec. 3- Any person or persons violating
any of the provisions of this ordinance
shall be deemed guilty of <del>this</del> a
misdemeanor and upon conviction
thereof shall be prohibited by fine in
any sum not expending one
hundred dollars.
Sec. 4- This ordinance shall take affect
and be in force from and after its
passage and publication
Passed the City Council Sept. 9 1885
Approved Sept. 9 1885
Alter J.C. Nama  A.M. Common
City Clerk Mayor

Which said pretended ordinance was
certified by the city clerk to have
been properly passed by the city 
council and to have been published
in Spokane Evening Review on 
Sept. 10 1885.

Your petitioner further represents
to your honor, that said restraint is
illegal for the following reasons
1- said Justice had no jurisdiction
to issue the aforesaid warrant and
the same was wholly said, for the
reason that no summons was issued
by said Justice at the time of or
before the issuing of said warrant,
and the said Justice for the same
reason had no jurisdiction to render
any judgement whatever against
your petitioner.

2- That said complaint states no
offense under said pretended ordi-
nance <del>for</del> and any judgement thereupon
rendered is void.
3- That said pretended ordinance 
is wholly void, for the reason that
said city council had no authority 
under this charter to pass
the same on any ordinance
on the matter of opium smoking
or inhaling on keeping a house
therefor.
Wherefore your petitioner prays
that a writ of Habeas Corpus may 
be issued by the clerk of your Honor's
Court,commanding said Glispon
to bring your petitioner before your
honor, that the cause of her restraint
may be inquired into, and she
released thereupon, if the same be found
illegal.
