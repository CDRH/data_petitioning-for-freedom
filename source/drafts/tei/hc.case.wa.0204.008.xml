<p>In the Matter of the Application of Margaret Roy for Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Janet Roy-Mackay for Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Robert C Saunders, U.S. Dist. Atty.,</p>
<p>Atty.for Government.</p>

<p>Ralph S. Pierce,</p>
<p>Atty.for Petitioners.</p>

<p>NETERER, District Judge, -----</p>

<p>These cases were heard together. The petitioners are sisters, and are held by the Commissioner of Immigration under an order of deportation issued by the Secretary of Labor under provisions of Section 4289 1/4 B, U.S. Compiled Statutes 1918, which provide, among other things that:</p>

<p>"The following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: Persons *** who disbelieve in or are opposed to organized government *** or persons likely to become a public charge **";</p>

<p>And Section 4289 1/4 J J, U.S. Compiled Statutes, supra, which provides among other things:</p>

<p>"At any time withing five years after entry, any alien who at the time of entry was a member of one or more of the classes excluded by law ***; any alien who at any time after entry shall be found advocating or teaching the unlawful destruction of property or advocating or teaching the unlawful destruction of property or advocating or teaching anarchy or the overthrow by force or violence of the government of the United States or of all forms of law."</p>

<p>The petitioners are 26 and 23 years of age, respectively, and came to the United States in October, 1916. They had not to exceen Twenty-five Dollars each when they arrived; they did "housework" at Lawrence, Massachusetts for a time then went ot Chicago and did similar work, and also worked in the I.W.W. bindery, and came to Seattle in October, 1918, and were, shortly thereafter, arrested.</p>

<p>The evidence in each case is very similar. Each petitioner charges that there is no evidence to support the warrant of deportation and that she was not accorded a fair hearing. An examination of the testimony is conclusive that each of the petitioners believes in the overthrow of all present forms of government and that any and all means necessary to gain that end are justified, even resorting to violence, and, that the general beliefs of the petitioners were the same at the time of entrance into the United States, although not so intensified, and that they advocated this doctrine and principle when opportunity afforded. Margaret Roy, in response to the question, "And you advocated this doctrine wherever you could?" said "Yes". The beliefs, practices and teachings of each petitioner are practically the same. There are several ways be which a person may teach or advocate. It need not be from the public platform or through the public press. It may be done in any way by which intelligent thought may be conveyed, by personal expression or any avenue through which information may be disseminated, or by the adoption of the expressed sentiment of others, or suggestions with relation to the guidance of the conduct of others.</p>

<p>For Janet Roy-Mackay, it is contended that after the order of deportation was made and while she was at liberty on bond awaiting deportation, she married a citizen of the United States and thereby became a citizen and that she may not be deported.</p>

<p>On the hearing it was stated that the husband of Janet Roy-Mackey was born in Scotland, that he came to the United States with his parents while a minor; he believed his father had become naturalized while he was a minor, and that acting under such belief he had excercised the rights of a citizen and becaue of such fact, it is asserted that a presumption would obtain that he is a citizen. In answer to his assertion, it is only necessary to say that citizenship is a privilege; it is the highest privilege that the government can give. It places a man of foreign birth on an equality with the native born. It is a privilege which the Congress of the United States may grant or withhold. It may grant it to certain classes of people or nationalities and withhold it from others, and residence in the United States or the exercise of any rights without compliance with the requirements will never ripen into citizenship. Citizenship may not be acquired by presumption. Before a person can be granted that high privilege, certain requisites are necessary. He must establish by competent testimony, among other things, that e is a lover of this, his adopted,country, and its Constitution and laws, and in sincerity dedicate his life to its service, and conscientiously agree to defend it against all enemies. There is no evidence before the court that Mr. Mackay's father was a citizen, and, if it be conceded that this issue is rightly before the court, it has not been sustained. The only matter for the Court's determination is whether the order of deportion of the Secretary of Labor is supported by any evidence however slight. If there is any evidence, the findings of the Secretary of Labor are conclusive. I think there is evidence to support the findings and the Court may not interfere.</p>

<p>Each petition is denied.</p>

<p>Judge.</p>
