      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable, the Law Commissioners' Court of St. 
Louis, County,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The petition of Joseph Adams 
Respectfully showeth</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That on the Eleveneth 
of (11) day of May AD. 1854. your petitioner was arrested 
and upon the oath of two police officers 
named Barry &amp; Beecher was committed 
by Justice Johnston to the Jail of St. Louis Co. 
kept by one James Castello, where he has been 
detained ever since, and where he is now detained. 
The charge exhibited against your sd. petitioner 
is, that he is A fugitive from labour, and A slave: 
To which charge your petitioner humbly says, 
that he is a free man, and always has been 
free, except for and during a term of years 
when he was bound as an apprentice to a 
certain Dr. Richard Barrett of the City and 
county of St. Louis, all of which he is ready to 
verify, your petitioner alleges that he is illegally 
held in imprisonment by the sd. James Castello, and 
who refused to release your sd. petitioners, he therefore 
prays your Honor to grant him the benefit of A writ 
of Habeas Corpus directed to the sd. James Castello requiring 
him to produce the body of your petitioner before your 
Honor together with the cause of his detention, and he will 
abide the decision of your Honor in the premises and 
for which he will ever pray.</p>
