    <li>Summary of Proceedings: William Butt was called into the office to give a deposition for a case he was involved in, Bensinger Self-Adding Cash Company vs. Chris Crotmak &amp; John Hman. He did not appear when he was supposed to, so Paul Stein forcibly took Butt to the room. Butt also refused to speak and then was committed to the county jail until he consented to give evidence. Butt said hat the notary public had no right to take said deposition in said room nor had Butt been notified according to law to appear in said place. The writ was allowed but ultimately the judge ruled that Butt was legally imprisoned.</li>
