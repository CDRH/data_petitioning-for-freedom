    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In late 1918, the Department of Labor ordered that Andy Pappas be deported for violating the U.S. Immigration Act of 1917, accusing him of assisting a prostitute and being liable to become a public charge. In March 1919, he was placed in the Douglas County jail to await deportation, unable or unwilling to pay a $1000 bond. Pappas petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on September 13, arguing that he was being detained indefinitely and that the amount of his bond was unconscionable. His petition was "denied on the merits" but "conditionally sustained"; the judge agreed that his detention was unlawful (since the Department of Labor was struggling to find a ship to return him to Greece) and ordered that his bond be reduced to $100. Pappas made bail on September 23, agreeing to remain in Dawson County until his deportation hearing. When he failed to show up for his hearing in December, he forfeited his bond. While his fate is unknown, the appearance docket record of his case concludes with a line saying that the a U.S. marshal was forced to return a writ of capias in November 1921 because Pappas was "not found."</li>
