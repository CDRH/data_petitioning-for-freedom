    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Arrested after giving his customer trading stamps which could be redeemed at his company for merchandise, James H. Flaherty petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that the ordinance used to convict him in Police Court was unconstitutional, therefore, he was being deprived of his liberty. Judge Holmes granted the petition. In his statement, Holmes claimed that the charge and arrest dealt with public morality, not public safety, thus it was not a valid exercise of police power. He also ruled that Flaherty's method of advertising was not improper, and that the ordinance he was charged with violating was unconstitutional. He cites rulings in several other states. He allowed the writ and ordered that Flaherty be released from custody. </li>
