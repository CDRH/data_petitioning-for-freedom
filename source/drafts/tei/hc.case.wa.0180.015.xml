<p>Exhibit "C"
Statement of K. Umeda, Made at Oakland Cal.
June 2, 1913</p>
<p>K. Umeda sworn by Thos M. Fisher</p>
<p>My first connection with this case was when I lived upstairs
over Ito's place at 1020 Stockton St., San Francisco. There 
was trouble there, the girl, Hana, wanted to live with Saito and I
was appealed to be Washio to held settle the trouble, I refused at
first but later Saito came to me and I said I would help. Saito
said he wanted to go into the country for the purpose of raising
this money. They money mentioned was money that it was agreed Saito
was to pay Washio for the girl Hana, I don;t recall the exact
amount. Saito asked me to stand good for the money also to stand
good for come bills he owed at some stores. I guaranted that Saito
would pay the money and on the strength of that guarantee Washio and
Ito allowed Hana to go with Saito. Ito was running a house of prostitution
at 1020 Stockton St., Saito and Hana were to go to Sacramento 
and possibly Fresno the understanding being that they were to
return in two weeks, they to try to raise the money in that time.
Instead of returning as agreed they ran away and went up north.</p>
<p>What I did in this matter in the first place was done through
friendship for Saito. When they didn't come back they all came to
me,. I having stook good for Saito, I had nbo interest whatsoever in
the woman or her earnings other then as I have already told you.
Washio sentphotographs of Hana around the country to try to locate
them, Washio was sore at e and also all the places where Saito
owed money. Having gone good for these people I paid a number of the bills
they owed then I went to Seattle to try to locate them, when I arrived
at Seattle I was met by a Japanese, whose name I don't know,
who had a telegram from Washio which he showed me saying I was going
to Seattle, that was soemtime in June or July 1912. I didn't locate
them so I came back to San Francisco, I was looking for them about a
week where she was, but when he started to show me he didn't know
where she was or couldn't find her and then he said she must have
gone to Tacoma. I went to Tacoma but couldn't find her. Washio was
in San Francisco when I returned. While I was in Seattle this Japanese
brought a man to my room and said he was a detective who had
been trying to locate Hana. I was rooming in the Ujine Hotel.</p>
<p>Shortly after I returned to San Francisco Washio went to Seattle
he wired to Ito from Seattle telling him to go to the Burns Agency
and Ito and I and Nakada went there. Washio had written a letter to
Ito telling Ito to have me swear out a warrant for Hana, when we asked
the Burns people about that they said it couldn't be done. Ito got
some other wires from Washio later and told me the party was coming. 
I didn('t go to the boat to meet them but I believe Ito did, also his
wife. The next night after they arrived I had a fight with Saito and
I hit him with a baibard cue, right after the fight I went up to Ito's
house of prostitution at 1020 Stockton St., Young and Sugiura were
present when Saito and I had the fight and they went up to Ito's
with me, after we got up in Ito's place Young and Siguria said that
Washio had agreed to pay them $800. for bringing Hana back and that
they wanted their money. I turned to Washio and asked him how he 
could make that kind of an agreement when he didn(t have any money.
<fw>15</fw>
<pb/>
Young and Sugiura told Ito and I that as Washio didn't have any money
we would have to pay them. We told them that as Washio had made the
agreement with them they must look to him for theirmoney, the next
day we went to the Imperial hotel on Ene St,m where Young and Sugiura 
were staying, to see them, Washio and I went there together and we met
Saito near there and went in the hotel all together, Young and 
Sugiura were both there, they said they had made an agreement with
Washio to bring the girl back to San Francisco and that he was to pay
them as soon as they arrived but he had gone gone back on his agreement,
we didn't arrve at any settlement that day but that evening
Young and Sugiura came to Ito's house and they called for me to come
theretoo, we talked about a settlement. Ito finally agreed to pay
part of the money and they he asked me to loan him some as he didn't 
have enough, I didn't have any ready money but I let Ito have my
watch which he took out and pawned it, he camed back and handed me
$200. in gold which I threw on the table Sugiura picked it up and
counted it and handed it to Young who put it in his pocket, Ito told
me he paid them $50. more later.</p>
<p>Young and Sugiura told us they had a lot of trouble getting the
woman and that they had to make her believe they were Immigration
officers, they said they were not taking chances on bringing her
down there to a house of prostitution for nothing and that it was
worth $800. to take the chances they had taken. They said that they
knew she was comming here to go into a house of prostitution and that
she was to do business here as a prostitute.</p>
<p>When we first got a tip that there was trouble started over this
woman haveing been brought down here Nakada phoned to Ito and I to
come to his office and when we went there he told us to get Hana out
of that house and hide her away he said the officers would be around
after that night or the next day. The next day Nakada came to Ito's 
house with an officer looking for her. I asked Nakada what they
wanted and he said we want the woman and that we must give her up. I
then went with Nakada and the officer to the room where Hana was I
asked Nakada what it ment and he said it was Seattle case and that if
I would give $40. he would fix things with the United States
Marshal so I wouldn't get into any trouble. Ito came to me the next
day and showed me $20. and two $10. in gold and said he was taking it
to Nakada for fixing things for him and wanted me to go with him and 
the money he came with an officer and arrested Ito's wife, I went to
Nakada then and asked him if they wanted me too he said he had fixed
things all right, he had told me before that to hide out as I was 
wanted.</p>
<p>It was the understanding of all of us that if found Hana was to 
be brought back to Ito's house of prostitution.</p>
<p>I certify the foregoing is a true and full transcript of the
stenographic notes made by me at the time of statement.</p>
