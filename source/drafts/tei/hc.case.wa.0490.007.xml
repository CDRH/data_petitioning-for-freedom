United States District Court 
Western District of Washington 
Northern Division.

In the Matter of the
Application of Ng Kwack Kang
For a Writ of Habeas Corpus

No. 3157
Filed January 14, 1916

Beeler and Sullivan,
For Petitioner

Clay Allen, U.S. Attorney
Albert Moodie, Asst. U.S. Atty. } For Government.

Neterer, District Judge:
The petitioner applied for admission to the United States
as the son of an American born Chinaman. His application was
denied by the Commissioner of immigration, an appeal was prosecuted
to the Secretary of Labor, the Commissioner affirmed, and
a warrant of deportation issued. Petition for writ of habeas
corpus was made, in which he charges, First, that he was not accorded
a fair hearing, in that he was denied the right of counsel,
and the evidence adduced at the preliminary examination was wrongfully
and unlawfully used against him at the hearing after arrest; 
Second, that there is no evidence in the record to support the
findings of the Immigration officers, and that the decision of
the Department of Labor is arbitrary and should be set aside,
and Third, that the applicant is entitled to have his appeal 
heard and determined by the Secretary of Labor. and that the 
record discloses that it was heard and determined solely by one
Alfred Hampton, and approved by Louis F. Post, Assistant Secretaty
of Labor.

An examination of the entire record shows that the petitioner
was accorded a fair trial. While an alien cannot clam the constitutional
rights guaranteed to a citizen, he has rights which, under
treaty stipulations and the law, must be respected. None of the
treaty rights nor provisions of the law applicable to this case
appear to have been violated. The examination of an alien for 
admission is necessarily summary and informal. The record shows
</p>
<pb></pb>

<p>
that no opportunity was denied the applicant to produce testimony
and all witnesses sought were examined. There is nothing
in the record to show that the right of counsel was denied. The
fact that counsel was not present or was not given opportunity 
to cross-examine the witnesses did not deprive him of a right,
Ex parte Chin Quack Wah, 224 Fed. 138; U.S. v. Williams, 190 Fed. 898

"If the petitioner was not denied a fair opportunity
to produce the evidence he desires or a fair, though 
summary, hearing, the case can proceed no further."
Chin Yow v U.S., 208 U.S., at page 11.

Courts have such jurisdiction only as is conferred by Congress. 
No discretion is vested, and Congress has the right to
prescribe rules, fix limitations, and confer authority where it
deems wise. By provision of Section 25 of the Chinese Exclusion
Act of February 20, 1907, 34 Stat. at Large, page 906, it is provided:

*******That in every case where an alien is excluded
from admission into the United States, under any 
law or treaty now existing or hereafter made, the decision
of the appropriate immigration officers, if adverse 
to the admission of such alien, shall be final, unless 
reversed on appeal to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor
*********.

The supreme authority is conferred upon the immigration officers,
and when it appears that petitioner was given a fair hearing,
Moola Singh et al, 207 Fed. 780. the writ must be denied. Even
though the court might arrive at a different conclusion or decision,
Chine Yow v. U.S., supra, such fact would not give the court
the right to review, where there is any evidence upon which to predicate
the finding. There is nothing in the record to show that 
the appeal to the Secretary of Labor was not determined by the
proper official, and in the absence of a showing to the contrary,
the memorandum decision will be held to be the decision of the
Secretary of Labor within the provisions of the act, In Re Jem
Yuen, 188 Fed. 350, Keyser v. Hitz, 133 U.S. 138.

The writ is discharged and the petitioner remanded to the
Department of Immigration.
