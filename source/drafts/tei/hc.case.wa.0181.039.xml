<p>IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE WESTERN 
DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Unlawful 
Detention of Pala Singh, 
Hindoo Alien.</p>
<p>: : :</p>
<p>No. 2532. PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.</p>
<p>TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT 
OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION:</p>
<p>The petition of Pala Singh respectfully shows:</p>
<p>-I-</p>
<p>That your petitioner is a former resident of the 
Philippine Islands and is at this time unlawfully detained by
the immigration authorities at the immigration station, Seattle, 
Washington.</p>
<p>-II-</p>
<p>That your petitioner was lawfully admitted at a regular 
immigration port of entry, Manila, Philippine Islands; was duly
examined by an immigration board and duly examined by medical 
officers of the United States government, and passed by said 
immigration officials at the said City of Manila, as being fit and
proper person to land in the territory held and controlled by 
the United States government, and as being strong and healthy
enough and free from disease, to be entitled to pass the medical
offices of the said immigration department; said immigrant was 
duly landed and lived for a short time in the City of Manila
and in the Philippine Islands, with the knowledge of the United 
States government.</p>
<p>-III-</p>
<p>That your petitioner is now imprisoned and restrained
of his liberty and detained by color of the authority of the
United States in the custody of the Commissioner of Immigration, 
Seattle, Washington, at the immigration detention house in said
city.</p>
<p>-IV-</p>
<p>That the sole claim or authority, by virtue of which
the said Commissioner of Immigration has restrained and detains
your petitioner is a certain warrant of arrest based upon Sections
2 and 20 of the Act of February 20, 1907, as amended by 
the Acts of March 26, 1910 and March 4, 1913, which warrant was
issued contrary to law and without any foundation in law.</p>
<p>-V-</p>
<p>That the alien and your petitioner represents that he
was not given a fair and impartial hearing, as is contemplated
by law; that the immigration officials and inspectors were biased
and prejudiced, which facts can be shown by affidavits or viva
voce testimony, if he is given permission to be heard by this
Honorable Court; that new testimony can be produced showing that
it would be an absolute impossibility for this alien to become a 
public charge, and showing that never has been a time since 
his landing on the soil of the United States when he was even 
likely to become a public charge. This petitioner has had his
constitutional gauranty denied him, and the entire proceeding from 
the landing of the petitioner on the steamship "Minnesota" has 
been a proceeding conducted not in accordance with law; that the
authority, so called, excercised by the Commissioner of Immigration
at Seattle, the Commissioner General of Immigration and the Secretary
of Labor, have not been fairly excercised, in justice, or in 
accordance with law; said officials have not acted within the
<pb></pb>
jurisdiction conferred upon them or in accordance with the provision
of the act affecting such cases. The government has contended 
that this man violated some law on entering, which is 
not true, and there has never been any evidence before any of 
the government officials showing any violation of law, but is much
evidence showing a proper landing, the inspection and examination
of the alien, in accordance with law. No evidence showing the
condition of the alien when he was examined the first time in 
Manila has been produced. The alien, having once been examined, 
in accordance with law, and passed, the second attempted examination
is improper, and not in accordance with law, and in direct
violation of the Act of February 20, 1907, as amended; that
your petitioner is not an alien immigrant, within the meaning of
the Act, having entered under a previous proper examination at
Manila. Your petitioner produced evidence which was not met by
the government, which positively proves that the government's
contention was untrue; that the alien has been denied his 
constitutional gauranties; that he has been held and threatened with
deportation, without having been given the equal protection of our
laws and he is being twice put in jeopardy, and he has had no
hearing and no testimony has been introduced showing him to come
within the confines of the Act upon which the government has based
this warrant for deportation, this alien has further been deprived 
of his rights as outlined in Article V, VI, VIII and XIV of the
Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>-VI-</p>
<p>That the issuing of the warrant, the holding of the 
examination by the immigration board at Seattle and on the steamship
"Minnesota", the decision of the board at Seattle, and the 
decision of the Secretary of Labor, or his representative, in
denying the rights of your petitioner to land at Seattle, were all
<pb></pb>
contrary to law and in direct violation of the Act of February 20, 
1907, as amended.</p>
<p>-VII-</p>
<p>That there was abuse of authority on the part of the
immigration board, and the Commissioner of Immigration at Seattle
and the Secretary of Labor, or his representative, at Washington,
in denying your petitioner the right to land at Seattle, as there
is absolutely no proper evidence upon whihc to base a decision.</p>
<p>-VIII-</p>
<p>That your petitioner's imprisonment, restraint and detention
are in violation of his rights, privileges and immunities,
under the Constitution and laws of the United States for the following
reasons:</p>
<p>First: That your petitioner had once been duly examined
and passed and could not lawfully be again examined, in accordance
with law.</p>
<p>Second: The issuing of the warrant was contrary to law,
and especially contrary to the Act of February 20, 1907, as amended
by the Act of March 4, 1913, for the reason that your petitioner
had never become a charge and had shown no likelihood of becoming
a charge, but on the other hand has affirmatively shown
that there was no likelihood of his ever becoming a charge; that
this man was examined at Manila under authority of the Act of
February 20, 1907, and if so, that examination was final and the
second examination at Seattle improper.</p>
<p>-IX-</p>
<p>That there was no evidence before the immigration board, 
the Commissioner, or the Secretary, upon which to base the ruling
of the board in rejecting the petitioner, and in requesting a 
warrant, or the Secretary in ordering this alien deported.</p>
<p>-X-</p>
<p>The alien resided a short time in the Philippine
Islands and never became a public charge or showed any likelihood
of becoming a charge, and as he was taken in custody immediately
upon arrival of the vessel, it cannot be said that he has become
a charge, as he has been in custody ever since leaving Manila,
and he has had no opportunity to show the fallacy of the government's
position.</p>
<p>-XI-</p>
<p>The Act of February 20, 1907, provides that a head tax 
of Four ($4) Dollars shall be collected. This man paid this head
tax when he was examined at Manila, and was not compelled to pay
the same on his arrival in Seattle; this provision and the law
indicating that the men are supposed to pay thsi fee but once,
and by inference they are not supposed to be examined more than
once. The Act itself specifically provides that is to apply to
and regulate the immigration of aliens into the United States.</p>
<p>Section six (6) of the Act of February 20, 1907, provides
that this Section was applied to the states and territories,
the District of Columbia, or places subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States.</p>
<p>By referring to Section twelve (12) and the last ten 
lines thereof, it will be noted that aliens coming from points
in the United States are treated differently from those coming 
from foreign ports.</p>
<p>Section thirty-three (33) provides that for the purpose
of the Act above quoted the words "United States" shall be construed
to mean the United States and any waters, territory or
other place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, except the
Isthmian Canal only.</p>
<p>-XII-</p>
<p>It will be noted by referring to page twenty-eight (28)
<pb></pb>
of the Regulations of July 1, 1907, paragraph "G" thereof, that
the aliens who have come from contiguous territory in the United
States, namely from Manila, are subject to different disposition
than those who have come from a foreign port.</p>
<p>-XIII-</p>
<p>The Commissioner of Immigration is threatening, unless
restrained, to deport this petitioner on authority of a warrant 
which was improperly issued and has no basis in law.</p>
<p>-XIV-</p>
<p>That the warrant issued is fatally defective in that it
does not comply with law and in particular does not comply with
the Act of February 20, 1907, as amended.</p>
<p>-XV-</p>
<p>That the alien is not amenable to the law, which is the 
basis for the issuance of this warrant.</p>
<p>-XVI-</p>
<p>That the Secretary of Labor, rendering the decisions in 
these cases, has violated the law, and particularly the Act of
February 20, 1907, as amended by the Acts of March 26, 1910, 
and March 4, 1913.</p>
<p>-XVII-</p>
<p>This Honorable Court has jurisdiction for the reason
that there is a question of law involved, viz: whether the alien, 
who presented an alien's certificate, form No. 546, which certificate
was signed by the Insular Collecter of Customs, and which
showed the due inspections and registration of the alien and contained
the following language "Will be admitted into the United 
States upon proper identification and surrender of this certificate
to any immigration officer at a designated port of entry",
and which certificate further contained the following "head tax
paid", whether the government, in view of that certificate and
<pb></pb> 
the examination at Manila, had the right to reexamine at Seattle 
or Tacoma.</p>
<p>-XVIII-</p>
<p>That a copy of the warrant is not attached here to
for the reason that the same is in the hands of the Immigration 
Department and has never been furnished to the alien or his 
attorney, said warrant contained langauge in substance to this
effect: "Said alien is a member of the excluded class in that
he was afflicted with trachoma, a dangerous and contagious disease
at the time of his entrance into the United States and that
he was at the time of such entrance a public charge."</p>
<p>-XIX-</p>
<p>The alien having been passed as sound in July and
there being competent testimony to he effect that the alien is 
not afflicted at this time, the government cannot contend that 
the alien comes within the confines of the Act.</p>
<p>-XX-</p>
<p>Trachoma, by the record, is shown to be a curable disease, 
even if the alien had suffered with the same.</p>
<p>-XXI-</p>
<p>The alien being, from the testimony, in the non-contagious
class, it cannot be said that alien is suffering with a 
dangerous and contagious disease, as charged in the warrant of 
arrest.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, your petitioner prays that a writ
of habeas corpus directing the immigration officals to bring the
said alien petitioner in court and to show cause of his detention, 
or for an order to show cause directing the immigration
officals to appear in court on a day certain answer the
<pb></pb>
petition herein filed, and to show cause why the said petitioner
should not be discharged and no longer held.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further prays that he may be discharged 
from custody and released as being improperly held, and for such
other and further relief as to the court may seem just and proper.</p>
