<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT 
OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>2500</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application

fact to be, that he should be deported from the United States
of America under and by virtue of the Chinese Exclusion acts.</p>
<p>II.</p>

by Ellis De Bruler was affirmed by the Secretary of Labor of the 
United States, the said officers herein named clearly abusing 
their discretion and violating the treaty relations between the

States of America, particularly Article 5 of the Amendments of 
the Constitution of the United States, and Article 14 of such
Amendments.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>That your petitioner is informed and believes and so 
states the fact to be, that Ellis De Bruler, Commissioner of Immigration,

offence for which they are now seeking to deport hm, for over 
seventeen (17) years in the United States of America, the sai d

person of the petitioner, Mac Fock, and of the subject matter 
therein set forth, and being duly and regularly authorized and 
empowered under and by virtue of the laws of the United States 
of America, to pass upon the matters and things set forth in the

aforesaid.</p>

<p>That said Mac Fock is one and the same person as was 
duly and regulary discharged as a native born Chinese, under and 
by virtue of the order of said Commissioner as aforesaid, and 
said order of discharge has never been cancelled or set aside by 
any state or Federal officer of the United States of America, 
nor by any Federal Court or State Court of the United States of 
America, nor by any order of any Commissioner of Immigration of 
the United States of America, from that time until this time, 
and said petitioner in all the intervening years has exercised all 
the rights and immunities of a native born citizen under and by 
virtue of said discharge as aforesaid.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, your petitioner prays that a Writ of Habeas 
Corpus may be granted, directed to the said Ellis De Bruler, 
Commissioner of Immigration, at the Port of Seattle, State of 
Washington, and to the United States Marshal for the Western 
District of Washington, and to the agent or representative acting
by, through or under them, or either of them, commanding him 
or them to have the body of said Mac Fock before your Honor at 
a time and place therein to be specificed, to do and receive what
shall then and there be considered by your Honor concerning him,
