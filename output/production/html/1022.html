    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 21, 1923, Hazel Dillon filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against the Child Saving Institute for detaining her three children: Emily, Earnest, and Mabel McCarty. She explained that she left her children under the care of the Child Saving Institute on June 30, 1923, while recovering from a serious illness and operation. On July 12, 1923, H. A. Collins filed a petition alleging that Hazel was &#x201C;incompetent, without means of support, and not a proper person&#x201D; to care for her children. She argued that this person swore under oath that they were a Douglas County resident, but they were actually a Sarpy County resident. Additionally, she argued that the Child Saving Institute did not make her aware of any petition asking for custody of her children. Lastly, she explained that she signed documents consenting to the adoption of her children because they were misrepresented as documents that would prevent the adoption. The President of the Child Saving Institute, Howard Sexton, denied these allegations. After the court hearing on September 12, 1923, her writ was denied and the fate of her children is unknown.</li>
