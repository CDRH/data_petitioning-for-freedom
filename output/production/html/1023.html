    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Fred V. Larson was a wealthy landowner from Kansas who conducted business across several states. In December 1916, he sold 390 acres in Graham County, Kansas, while still owing $1500 to a mortgage on that land. He took out a second mortgage for $760 on what he already owed and traded it to H. V. Stiller for $400 and three mules. On April 8th, 1917, he left the State of Kansas and informed his acquaintances that he was going to Nebraska. The Government of Kansas, fearing that he had fled to avoid paying his debt, issued a warrant for his arrest and sent it to the Governor of Nebraska. On the evening of April 16th, 1917, Larson was arrested and imprisoned by the Omaha Chief of Police and Chief of Detectives. This led Larson to apply for a writ of Habeas Corpus. On April 21st, 1917, his writ was allowed, and his captors were ordered to bring him and appear before the court on April 24th of the same year. It remains unclear whether or not Larson was released from their custody. </li>
