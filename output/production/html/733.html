    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On April 6, 1920, Mae and Charles Smith were married in Omaha, Nebraska. Their marriage did not last long: Mae filed for divorce in the October of 1921. She must have been heavily pregnant at the time, as she gave birth to Charles's son, Delbert Dean Smith, on January 8, 1921. Despite being summoned to court repeatedly, Charles never showed up. Finally, on July 12, 1921, judge Charles A. Goss granted Mae Smith a divorce "on the grounds of extreme cruelty." He also gave her complete custody of Delbert. Despite this, around June 1, 1922, Charles came to Mae's house and asked to take the child on a short visit. She acquiesced, but Charles and her son never returned. She believed he had taken him back to Sterling in Johnson County, Nebraska, where Charles now lived. In an attempt to regain custody of her son, Mae filed a writ of habeus corpus on November 6, 1922, but it was returned unserved&#x2014;presumably because, like the earlier divorce trial, Charles refused to answer summons and evaded legal authorities. She filed another writ on April 2, 1923, but 11 days later, this writ was returned unserved as well. Finally, the case was dismissed for a want of prosecution on January 21, 1924. Census and Social Security records indicate that Delbert spent the rest of his childhood with Charles and his second wife, Lola. The family even moved back to Omaha in time for the 1930 census. It is unknown if either Delbert or Mae knew that the other lived in the same city during this period of time. </li>
