    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Joe Martin, the bound party, entered the country in 1907 from Russia and joined the IWW, a union organization, in 1914. On January 14th, 1918, the bound party was arrested on a warrant issued by the Secretary of Labor, William B. Wilson (unnamed in the petition). The bound party was charged with being an alien, advocating or teaching the destruction of property, and being likely to become a public charge. On March 26th, 1918, W. P. Callahan, immigration inspector, interrogated the bound party on these issues and found the charges to be substantiated. The attorney for the petitioner does not agree that the questions were relevant. On January 8th, 1919, a writ of Habeas Corpus was filed. The fate of the petition and the bound party are unknown.</li>
