<p>Exhibit "A"</p>

<p>In Justice Court of Columbia County Washington Territory
before W H Kuhn Justice of the Peace</p>

<p>The Territory of Washington<lb/>
vs<lb/>
S.M. McFarland</p>

<p>To the Sheriff or any constable and the keeper
of the County Jail <unclear/> County</p>

<p>Whereas at a Justice Court held at my office
in said County for the examination of S.M McFarland
 the above named defendant upon the
written complaint under oath of M Cross charging
that the said defendant SM McFarland on the 24th
day of April 1888 within Columbia County aforesaid
unlawfully did remove from the County of Columbia
in said Territory certain personal property towit
One brown mule about seven years old One brown mule
about seven years old One set of team harness and
one 3 1/2 inch Steel Skein Barn Wagon which said
personal property the said SM McFarland had
therefore towit On May 15th 1886 duly mortgaged
by certain chattel mortgage bearing date on that
day to M Cross to secure the payment by a certain
promissory note therein set forth which said
personal property was at the date of said mortgage
situate in Columbia County aforesaid and that
said property was so removed as aforesaid
without the said mortgage being duly released
and without the consent in writing or otherwise
of said mortgage M Cross and after hearing
the evidence adduced and the arguments
of counsel it appears to the satisfaction of
the Court that an offense against the Laws

<pb/>

of said Territory has been committed and that
there is probable cause for charging the
defendant with said offense and whereas the
said SM McFarland has failed to give bail
in the sum of Three hundred dollars for
his appearance to answer at the next term of
the District Court for said County as required
by me</p>

<p>Therefore in the name of the United States
you the said Sheriff or said Constable are commanded
forthwith to convey and deliver the said
SM McFarland to the said keeper and you
the said keeper are commanded to receive <del>the</del>
him the said SM McFarland into your custody
in said jail and him there safely keep until
here discharged by due course of law</p>

<p>Given under my hand May 9th 1888</p>

<p> <unclear/> W H Kuhn<lb/>
Justice of the Peace</p>
