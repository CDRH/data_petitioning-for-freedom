<p>The petition of 
Nelson Lawson respectfully showeth:</p>

<p>That on the 6th day of April last he was committed 
to the Jail of St. Louis Co. on A <unclear>mittimus</unclear> issued by 
Peter W. Johnston A Justice of the peace of St. Louis Co. 
Charging him with being A fugitive from labour or A 
Run-a-way slave. this upon the affidavit of A certain 
Matthew Monaghen A police officer of this city:</p>
<p>To all of which your petitioner answers, that he is not A 
slave, and never has been A slave. that he was born free 
in the year Eighteen hundred and Thirty Seven in the 
borough of Carlisle and State of Pennsylvania where 
his parents then resided and where his Mother, Sisters, 
and Brothers now reside and where he is well known 
by nearly all the inhabitants of that town, as will he made 
appear by the accompanying documents recently obtained 
by his attorney and which it is believed will remove all 
doubts relative to his being A <del>for now</del> Slave, and therefore 
he is illegally restrained of his liberty your sd. petitioner complains that his imprisonment is 
unjust and oppressive, and that his further detention 
in jail is <del>unjust illegal and oppressive</del> unnecessary and uncalled for and that he has not 
made application to a court of higher jurisdiction. <del></del> 
We therefore pray your Honor to grant him the 
peoples writ of Habeas Corpus directed to R.F. Logan 
<del>jailor of</del> keeper of sd. prison, that his case may be 
inquired into by your Honor and that he may undergo 
and receive all such things as the court may consider 
in the premises. And for which he ever prays</p>

<p>Nelson Lawson 
mark</p>


<p>for and in behalf of the sd Lawson</p>
<p>Personally appeared John J. Schuler and made 
oath the he believes and has a right to believe the statement of facts set forth 
in the foregoing petition is true.</p>
