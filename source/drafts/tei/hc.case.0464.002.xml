<pb/>

which judgment was rendered on the 26th day of March

V1.

That the said alleged judment is still in existence.
That the same has been appealed from to the Supreme Court of
the State of Washington, and the said judgment affirmed, and is
now in existence and in force and full effect. That under said
judgment the said Moyer assumes to imprison and to keep imprisoned

to be held for the petiod of Seven years.

V11.

That the imprisonment of this petitioner by the said

and proceeding would wholly be contrary to petitioner's right
as a citizen of the United States, and particularly in violation
of your petitioner's rights as a citizen of the United States,
contrary to the laws of the United States, in violation of the
Constitution of the United States and directly against the
special right and immunity and exemption from imprisonment

the charge of an infamous crime without due process of law
###". And the further provision that "Such person when held
or attempted to be held shall by indictment be informed of the
nature and cause of the accusation". That this provision was in
pursuit of the Common Law and meant that the facts and circumstances 
of the charge shall be presented to the defendant in

the right ### to demand the nature and cause of the accusation 
against him; to have a copy thereof, etc.", being Section

X.

arraigned upon the form of alleged indictment hereinbefore stated
and immediately in the Superior Court demurred to the same upon
the ground that it did not state the facts nor inform him of the 
nature and cause of his accusation; that the Code of Washington
provided that in all criminal offenses, being the laws of
