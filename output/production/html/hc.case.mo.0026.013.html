two or three weeks ago he saw the girl now present tied to a bedpost 
and Mr Placket beating her over the head with a broom stick and 
also pushing or punching her in the side with the end of it—some 
short time after that he saw the girl <del/> down and Mr Plackett  
either kicking or stomping her. he is not sure which—a few minutes 
before he had seen the girl with irons on and he thinks had them 
on then—</p>
