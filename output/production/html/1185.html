    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On April 28th, 1919, Sol Margultz filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus by his attorneys in the District Court in Douglas County of Nebraska, saying that he was unlawfully detained and deprived of liberty. Margultz maintained that he was being held in the custody of D. Berenberg in Douglas County, Nebraska on a criminal offense allegedly committed in April of 1917 in St. Joseph, Missouri and a warrant for arrest issued in July 1917 based on the charge of grand larceny. Being confined in Douglas County was pursuant to a writ of extradition that was granted by the acting Governor of Nebraska at the time. However it was stated in Margultz&#x2019;s petition that for the previous 29 years he did reside in Douglas County and that his home address shared with a wife and children had been printed in the Directory of the Nebraska Telephone Company for the previous 2 years. The writ of extradition was then held void and of no force as the application presented did not comply with practices of the Interstate Extradition Conference of 1887. The original warrant that was filed by a justice of the peace in Missouri had been tampered with and thus Margultz was filing for a writ of Habeas Corpus from the mentioned unlawful imprisonment. It is unknown how the judge ruled on Margultz' petition and his ultimate fate is unknown.</li>
