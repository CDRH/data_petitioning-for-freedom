    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Mrs. Bessie Pfiffer filed for habeas against Charles H. Codding and Elizabeth A. Codding over custody of her daughter, Dorothy Pfiffer, a 10-month-old baby girl, on December 13. The Coddings said that the baby had been left on their doorstep with a note from "Mother Stork." Bessie said that this was only meant to be temporary, while the Coddings assumed that this meant they were adopting the child. A writ was issued by Judge Estelle and Mrs. Pfiffer was granted custody of her daughter.</li>
