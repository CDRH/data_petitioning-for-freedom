    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Antonio Seston petitioned for a writ of Habeas Corpus in March of 1924 after he had been arrested and then deprived of his liberty by Frank Hays Jr. in the previous year, Seston, having been born in Italy, made his way to New York where he applied for and received papers of naturalization, after which he had been and was residing in Omaha, Nebraska. When arrested, he was charged with violating the Immigration Act of 1917, with the prosecution arguing that he was dealing and having relations with prostitutes. Seston presented that he was being deprived of his liberty and held for the purpose of deportation and the court ruled for him to be discharged. It was April of the following year that Hays filed and was granted an appeal based upon assignments of error. It was June 1926, that a mandate from the Circuit Court of Appeals was filed reversing the decision to discharge Seston along with instruction to discharge the writ of Habeas Corpus and remand Seston for deportation. </li>
