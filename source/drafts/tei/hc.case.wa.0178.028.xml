<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON 
NORTHEN DIVISION.</p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application
of MAC FOCK 
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>No. 2500</p>
<p>Filed Aug. 25 1913.</p>
<p>Victor M. Place, 
L Frank Brown, For Petitioner</p>
<p>E.B. Brockway, For Respondent.</p>
<p>NETERER, District Judge.</p>
<p>The petitioner alleges in substance that he arrived at
the port of Seattle on his return from China on the 21st day 
of March, 1913, and was denied admission by the Commissioner 
of Immigraton; that an appeal was prosecuted from the decision
of the Commissioner of Immigration to the Secretary of Labor, 
and so that such decision was affirmed. He further alleges 
that he had resided in the United States for over seventeen
years; that he has in his possession a certificate issued 
by Felix W. McGettrick, United States Commissioner, bearing date
June 12, 1896, issued to him upon his discharge after arrest
for being unlawfully in the United States. Attached to the 
petition is a copy of the alleged certificate, which reads 
as follows:</p>
<p>"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
DISTRICT OF VERMONT.</p>
<p>Before me, Felix W. McGettrick, a commissioner of the Circuit
Court of the United States, within and for said District, 
compalint was presented by John H. Senter, United States Attorney, 
within and for said District, charging in substance that 
on or about the 12 day of June, 1896, at Richford in said District, 
Mack Fock in violation of Section.....of the Revised 
Statutes of the United States, did unlawfully come and was in 
the United States, and on the 12 day of June 1896 defendant was 
brought before me, the said commissioner, at my office, in St. 
Albans, in said District, and upon full hearing on said charge 
the said District Attorney being present, it was adjudged by me 
that said Mac Fock had the lawful right to be and remian in 
the United States, by reason of being a citizen thereof, and he 
was accordingly discharged.</p>
<p>Given under my hand and seal at St. Albans, in the District 
of Vermont, this 12 day of June 1896. </p>
<p>Felix W. McGettrick,
United States Commissioner for 
District of Vermont.</p>
<p>(Seal).</p>
<p>A photograph is attached to the certificate.</p>
<p>On the 9th day of June a writ was issued directing the proper
officers to produce in court Mac Fock, to do and receive</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p><pb></pb>
concerning the said Mac Fock what should then be directed.
A return was made to the writ as directed, in which the 
possession of the certificate is admitted. The return 
further states that Mac Fock is held under order of 
deportation; that he applied for admission to the United States 
as a returning native born American of Chinese descent, and 
that upon the examination by the Commissioner of Immigration 
upon oral and documentary evidence, it ws found that Mac Fock 
was born in China; that an appeal was prosecuted to the 
Secretary of Labor, who affirmed such decision. A reply is 
filed to this answer, in which it is stated, in substance, 
that Mac Fock had lived in the United States in various parts
for more than seventeen years, that before his departure 
for China he presented the certificate to the Commissioner
of Immigration, and that it was pronounced genuine, and that 
the petitioner thereupon departed for China, relying upon the 
investigation made by the immigration officers of his right 
to re-enter. All of the evidence taken before the Commissioner 
of Immigration and the record on appeal is a part of the record
in this case. A motion is made by the government that the 
proceedings herein be dismissed upon the pleadings and admitted 
facts as disclosed by the record, and that the petitioner
be held for deportation.</p>
<p>it is contended on the part of the petitioner, first, that 
the certificate issued to him by Felix W. McGettrick, United 
States Commissioner, is a final adjudication of the petitioner's 
right to admittance; second, that the immigration department, 
having investigated the certificate and pronounced it genuine. 
led the petitioner to believe that he could re-enter, and is 
now precluded and estopped to deny his admittance.</p>
<p>It has been repeatedly held that where a Chinese person 
for alleged unlawful residence in the United States has been 
apprehended and given a fair trial and discharged, and a judgement 
of discharge entered upon the merits, that it constitutes 
an adjudication of the right of the Chinaman to remain in the 
United States.</p>
<p>Leung Jun v. United States, 171 Fed. 413.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p><pb></pb>
The first question is to be disposed of is, is the certificate 
which was presented a judgment in contemplation of the 
exclusion act? I think a reading of the document is 
sufficent to conclusively show that it is not. On its face it 
shows that it is not a judgement. It does not purport to be a 
certified copy of any judgment, or record of judgment. It is 
not a document which is issued pursuant to any law. It is not 
a document which could be considered as evidence by any court 
or tribunal. It is merely a statement that a certain act 
had been done. It does not purport to, nor does it in fact 
fill the requirments of any rule of evidence, state law or 
act of Congress with relatation to authentication of records of 
the United States.</p>
<p>"A written statement of a United States Commissioner that 
a Chinese person of a certain name was brought before him and 
was adjudged to have the right to remain in the United States
by reason of being a citizen is not a evidence of a judgement."</p>
<p>Ah How v. United States, 193 U. S. 65;</p>
<p>United States v. Lew Poy Dew, 119 Fed. 786.</p>
<p>Estoppel cannot operate as against the government, nor do 
the facts show abuse or discretion. Upon the conceded facts with 
relation to this certificate, it being all the proof that was 
presented the department of immigration cannot be criticized 
for further examination with relation to the nativity of the 
petitioner. The examination as disclosed by the record seems 
to have been fair and impartial, and no undue advantage taken 
of the petitioner. The examination disclosed that the petitioner 
was born in China; that he arrived in Vancouver, and entered 
the United States at Richford, Vermont; that the certificate 
was there given to him; and it was fraudulently issued or 
obtaine under purjury. The petitioner, if not an actual 
participant, was the beneficiary, and knew of the wrongful 
practices.</p>
<p>Being in the United States unlawfully and the beneficiary 
of the certificate unlawfully issued, and having lived in the 
United States for seventeen years, and knowing of the fraud
or purjury practiced upon the issuance of the certificate, and 
the fraudulent practices continued by him upon the immigration 
commissioner when he obtained an expression of regularity of</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>such certificate, the petitioner upon the record before the 
court cannot complain. No lapse of time would ripen such 
a wrong into a right, nor afford a basis upon which to predicte
abuse of discretion. The department of immigration did 
not abuse its discretion.</p>

<p>United States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U. S. 161.</p>
<p>The motion is granted, the writ discharged, and the petitioner
remanded to the custody of the Commissioner of Immigration.</p>
