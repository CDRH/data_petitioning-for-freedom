    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Around September 18, 1923, Duncan Burrage was arrested on the charge of vagrancy based on a complaint signed by the city prosecutor, D.E. O'Brien, and a writ of mittimus signed by police magistrate Frank M. Dineen. He was then sentenced to be confined for 60 days in the Criminal Division of Central Station of the Municipal Court of the City of Omaha. On October 29, 1923, his attorney, J.D. Cranny, of the firm Cranny &amp; Moore, filed a petition for a writ of habeus corpus, demanding that sheriff M. L. Endres produce Burrage in front of judge Charles A. Goss. He claimed that the complaint for vagrancy was invalid because it was signed by the city prosecutor, who did not have the authority to make such a claim, the Douglas County municipal court didn't have the jurisdiction to imprison him and the complaint was not sworn to by a judge or clerk or filed for record in Omaha's municipal court. A hearing was held that same day in which the petition was granted and Burrage was discharged.</li>
