<p>HUSBAND</p>

<p>Attest,
N.N. Husband
Commissioner General</p>

<p>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION
WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Sept. 21, 1921</p>

<p>United States Attorney,
Seattle, Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
</p>

<p>Confirming your telegram of September 19, 1921, regarding the case
of John Matthews, I wish to state that this alien has told so many falsehoods
in his testimony at the time of arrest that it is almost impossible to
asscertain what country he is really a subject of.</p>

<p>The countries of Ukrainia and Eastern Galacia (West Ukraunia) have
not been recognized by the United States Government, and, of course, all matters
pertaining to the procuring of passports for aliens who are ordered deported
to these countries have to be taken up informally with the representatives
thereof in Washington, D.C.     In the present case it was first thought that
the alien was from Ukrainia, but after the Ukrainian Representative reviewed
the evidence submitted by the Bureau for a passport he himself referred the
matter of the Eastern Galacian Representative, due to the fact that he thought
that the alien was from Eastern Galacia, he (the alien) having stated in his
hearing that he was born in the town of Czortkow (English spelling "Chortkof"),
town of Noshkofsky which is located in Eastern Galacia.</p>

<p>Matthews landed at Victoria, B.C. August 31, 1919, verification of
which landing is now in the file you now have. At the time of landing he
stated he was twenty-seven years of age, which would now make him about twenty-
nine years old. At the time he testified that he was born in Warsaw, Poland,
which was evidently a fabrication. At any rate the Government of Poland will
not give this man a passport and it is the Bureau's opinion that when he stated
that he was born in the town above mentioned he told the truth inasmuch as he
also stated that his father was born in this town.</p>

<p>The Bureau has been unable to secure a certified copy of the treaty
fixing the present boundaries of Eastern Galicia, but is transmitting herewith
a document which shows the statue of this country at the present time.</p>

<p>Respectfully,
Husband
Commissioner-General</p>

<pb></pb>
