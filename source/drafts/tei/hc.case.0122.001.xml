<p>The petitition of S.M. McFarland the plaintiff

<p>1st That he is illegally imprisoned detained
confined and restrained of his liberty
by N.R. Marquiss Sheriff of Columbia
County, Washington Territory, that
he is now confined by your Sheriff in the County Jail at the
City of Dayton in the County and Territory aforesaid.</p>

<p>2nd That the cause or pretense of such
imprisonment and restraint according
to the best of the knowledge and belief of the 
applicant is this; that applicant was

 of the Peace in and for Columbia
County Washington Territory, for examination
 upon a charge of having removed
certain personal property upon which he had

<pb/>


given a Mortgage from the County of Columbia,
 Where said property was situated
at the date of said mortgage, and before said
Mortgage was duly released or without the
consent in writing of the mortgage, and upon
such examination the said Justice of the Peace
ordered the said applicant to be held to answer
said charge before the Grand Jury of Columbia
County. And the said Sheriff N.R. Marquiss
claims to hold keep imprison and restrain 
applicant of his liberty by virtue of a commitment 
issued by said Justice of the Peace authorizing
him to take into his custody and
safely keep said applicant</p>

<p>3rd That such restraint is illegal in this:
That the complaint upon which said 
applicant was arrested and examined does not
charge the commission of any acts which are
made criminal by the laws of Washington
Territory, and that the said charge upon which
the applicant was arrested examined and
committed is not a crime or offense 
under the laws of Washington Territory or any
law</p>

<p>That said Sheriff N.R. Marquiss has no
writ of committment issued by said Justice
 of the Peace or any Justice charging or
accusing the applicant with having committed
 any crime or offense known by the law</p>

<p>That said Justice of the Peace had no legal
or probable cause to commit the applicant

<lb/>

to answer said charge or any charge and said
Committment does not charge any crime or
offense known to the law.</p>

<p>Wherefor he pays for Writ of Habeas
Corpus, that the same may be inquired into
and he be dischared.</p>
