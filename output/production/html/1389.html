    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Peter Clifford filed two petitions for Habeas Corpus, eventually combined into one in June 1904. Clifford was the ex-husband of Grace Williams and lived in San Francisco. Divorced the prior year, Williams was awarded custody of their daughter Alice, and Clifford was awarded visitation rights every week. 

In his petition, Peter claimed that Grace had "surreptitiously and secretly" left Seattle for San Franciso and that he had received a ruling in his favor from a San Francisco court that reversed the custody arrangement and placed Alice in his custody. Between their divorce and Peter's claim in California, Grace married Herbert Williams and the couple formerly adopted Alice and renamed her Alice Williams in a Seattle court in December 1903. 

The primary arguments, in this case, revolved around jurisdictions. Initially, Judge Tallman ruled for the Williams's and seemed to have been swayed by Grace's testimony about Peter's abusive alcoholism. Clifford claimed that the U. S. Constitution's clauses forced the state of Washington to accept and respect a California court's ruling in his favor. The case then moved to Federal Court (it is not entirely clear how it got from State court to the Ninth Circuit) and Judge Hanford upheld Grace's custody and dismissed the Habeas petitions.</li>
