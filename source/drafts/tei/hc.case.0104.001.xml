<p>In The District Court of the Second Judicial Dis-
trict of Washington Territory, holding terms 
at Tacoma, in and for Pierce County.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application 
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus by cer-
tain Chinamen, whose names are here-
after written. PETITION</p>

<p>To The Honorable Frank Allyn, Judge of the 
above entitled Court:</p>

<p>This Petition of certain Chinamen hereinafter named, 
respectfully shows:</p>

<p>FIRST.</p>

<p>That your petitioners are unlawfully detained and 
restrained of their liberty by Captain James Carroll, 
Master of the steamship "Ancon", now lying at the Port 
of Tacoma, in Pierce County, Washington Territory, and 
within the Second Judicial District of said Territory, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Court; and your 
petitioners are now on board of said steamship, and are 
there so detained and restrained of their liberty as 
aforesaid, and their names are as follows, to-wit:</p>

<p>Ah Gow, Ah Chong, Ah Lum, Lum Cuoy, Chung Chang, Ling 
Long, Gen Chock, Ah Woo, Say Suoy, Ah John, Ah Chuck, Ah 
See, Ah Gong, Ah Hong, Gee Chong, Hong Kong, Ah Chuy, Ah 
Hay, Wing Gay, Sin Wah, Ah Poy, Chen Yook, Lum Hong, Ah 
Wing, Ah Nam, Ah Suoy, Chung Greng, Chew Ming, and Ah 
Wai.</p>

<p>SECOND.</p>

<p>That the cause or pretense of such detention and

<pb...></pb...>

<note>2443</note>

restraint, according to the best knowledge and belief of 
your petitioners, is as follows, to-wit:</p>

<p>Your petitioners have been residents of the United 
States for the term of Five years and more last past, 
having resided during such time at and about a port or 
landing known as "Tongas Landing", in the Territory of 
Alaska; and, on the eleventh day of October, 1888, they 
took passage on board said steamship for the port of 
Port Townsend, in Washington Territory, and within the 
United States of America, that, in due course of said 
voyage, and without touching at any port or place, the 
said steamship, with your petitioners on board, arrived 
at said Port Townsend on the fifteenth day of October, 
1888.</p>

<p>THIRD.</p>

<p>That during all of the time between the time of de-
parture from the said Territory of Alaska and until they 
arrived at said port of Port Townsend, they were on 
board the said steamship or vessel "Ancon", and which 
ship or vessel was during all of said time, and is now, 
an American steamship, duly registered in the Port of 
San Francisco, and within the United States of America.</p>

<p>FOURTH.</p>

<p>That upon their arrival at said port of Port Town-
send, the United States Collector of Customs at said 
Port, refused to allow them to go ashore, but compelled 
them to remain on board of said steamship, where they 
now are; and said Collector further ordered and directed to

<pb...></pb...>

<note>2443</note>

the aforesaid Master of said steamship to retain your 
petitioners on board of the same, and your petitioners 
are now under the custody and control of said Master, 
and under his restraint.</p>

<p>FIFTH.</p>

<p>That, as your petitioners are informed and do verily 
believe, they were prevented from landing at said Port 
and are now subjected to the restraint of said Master, 
by and on account of the provisions and terms of a cer-
tain Act of the Congress of the United States, known as 
the "Chinese Exclusion Act", which was passed and ap-
proved on the first day of October, 1888, and took ef-
fect from and after its passage.</p>

<p>SIXTH.</p>

<p>The preventing of your petitioners to land at said 
Port and their present detention and the restraint of 
their liberty, are illegal in this, to-wit:</p>

<p>Your petitioners, prior to the passage of said Act, 
were residents of the United States of America, and ever 
since have been and still are residents of said United 
States, and have never departed therefrom in any manner 
whatsoever, but have been at all the times here inbefore 
mentioned, simply going from one Port within the United 
States of America to another port therein, upon an Amer-
ican vessel, flying an American flag, and without touch-
ing or landing at any foreign port or place whatsoever; 
and your petitioners therefore aver that they are not 
within the terms or meaning of said Act of Congress, and

<pb...></pb...>

<note>2443</note>

are lawfully entitled to land at said port of Port Town-
send or at any port within the United States of America, 
provided they do not, before such landing, depart from 
the United States of America.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE, to be relieved of said unlawful 
detention and to be liberated from such unlawful res-
traint, your petitioners pray:</p>

<p>That a Writ of Habeas Corpus, to be directed to the 
said James Carroll, Master of said steamship, may issue 
in this behalf, so that your petitioners may be forth-
with brought before this Court, or the Judge thereof, 
at such time and place as the Court or Judge may direct, 
to do and receive what shall be ordered concerning them.</p>
