    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On September 1, 1888, a complaint was filed in Garfield, Whitman County, Washington against Edgar Bunnell and Arthur Bunnell for being drunk and disorderly, which violated section 12 of article 8 of the town ordinances of Garfield, Washington. It is unknown how exactly the Bunnell men were related. On September 8, 1888, they were brought before the town clerk, Thomas Kennedy, and fined $15 each plus court costs of $65.81. Since Garfield was such a small town, the town clerk also acted as a police court judge and justice of the peace. The men petitioned for a writ of habeus corpus against Garfield town marshall William Isbell on September 10, 1888, claiming it wasn't in Kennedy's jurisdiction as a town clerk to sentence them. On September 11, 1888, the men paid their bond and were released from custody. In his answer to the men's writ, Isbell pointed out that the men had already been released and that Kennedy was a qualified justice of the peace. In the hearing on September 25, 1888, judge William G. Langford denied and quashed the writ, as well as ordering the Bunnells to pay Isbell's court costs.</li>
