    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Ethel Johnson was arrested on February 9, 1919 for keeping a "Common Illgoverned House" based on the accusation of a man named J.B. Murray. She was tried at police court under magistrate Charles E. Foster on the tenth and sentenced to thirty days in prison plus court costs. She filed a petition for a writ of habeus corpus against Omaha sheriff Michael L. Clark on February 14, which was issued by judge William A. Redick. In her petition, she argued that she should be set free because the ordinance outlawing prostitution in the city of Omaha did not provide for prison sentences above ten days. She had also tried to pay an appeal bond on February 13, and although she had the money and a surety, the court refused to allow the bond, as it had been more than 24 hours since the judgement. Clark merely stated that he had the authority to imprison her based on the writ of mittimus submitted by police magistrate Charles E. Foster. On March 21, 1919, her application was granted and she was set free.</li>
