    <li>Summary of Proceedings: After hearing evidence from Adrian Mills, Viola Mills' father, regarding Viola being "incorrigible" and growing up "in vice," County Judge Stewart ordered that Viola be institutionalized at the State Reform School in Kearney, Nebraska. Days later, Viola Mills petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that Sheriff Samuel McClay was depriving her of her liberty. The petition was granted by Judge Addison Tibbetts. After hearing evidence, Judge Tibbetts ordered that Viola be released. </li>
