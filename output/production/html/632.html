    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Mabel Best petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve her twelve-year-old daughter, Isabel Sanderson, from the child's father, Jonathan Sanderson, which was granted. At the hearing, Mabel and Jonathan agreed to share custody of their daughter, modifying an earlier agreement recorded on page 665 of court journal number 71. It appears that the writ was amicably dismissed.</li>
