I am informed that
a lady by name of Mrs. Josie
Wood Alias Ray Raymond has trial
for murder in your city, &amp; that
you defendant there. I have
known her for 15 years &amp; known
her parents she is crazy &amp; a
woman of unsound mind I 
was married to her in Arwood
File, some 14 years ago &amp; I
lived with her for 5 or 6 years
&amp; have two boys by her although
she is now dire for me
&amp; has been her dome 6 or 7 
years. She would not shoot any
one in her right mind she
hereby crazy. I am no friend
of hers and do care if 
should murders but I do and 
I really believe her to be out
of her mind.
I am not foreman
of the grand jury of the 1st
district court of Was Terr in
Session in Ogden and I
will sware she is and can be
proven as a woman of no
second reason.
Please excuse this I 
am in a great hurry
yours truly
W.J. Wood

Jury Ogden Utah
