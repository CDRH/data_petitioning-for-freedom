    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In the fall of 1921, Willard Mathews negotiated a deal in the Douglas County district court whereby he would plead guilty to having embezzled funds from the Pioneer State Bank in Omaha, Nebraska, if the state would drop related charges against two of his colleagues. He was sentenced to between one and ten years at the state penitentiary. After unsuccessfully appealing his conviction in the state supreme court, Mathews petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. He argued that he had embezzled funds during a window in which Nebraska had repealed one set of criminal statutes but not yet replaced them, and that therefore he had violated no law. After hearing the evidence, he was remanded to the custody of the warden.</li>
