<p>To the Hon. R.A. Jones Judge Presiding</p>

<p>And now comes Jennie Miller Powers the applicant above named and for answer herein <unclear>controverting</unclear> the allegations set up in the return to the writ of habeas corpus herein made and filed April 10th 1888 by the above named Mary Elizabeth Miller and R.J. Miller her husband alleges as follows towit</p>

<p>II</p>
<p>First she admits that said respondents have been in custody and possession of said child Mary Alice Powers since the 3rd of November 1884 but she denies that said respondants have wholly or exclusively had the control or possession of said child and she most emphatically denies that she has or
<pb/>

ever did wholly or exclusively or in any other manner whatsoever abandon the said child or refuse to own or recognize the said child for that all such allegations of abandonment, desertion neglect and refusal to own and recognize said child are wholly, entirely, maliciously, and wilfully false in whole and in part and in every particular whatsoever and she denies that the custody and possession of said child by the said respondants was ever permitted after towit March 1885. otherwise then in persuance of an agreement between the applicant and her former husband that respondants should keep and care for said child for pay pending the determination of her divorce suit then pending against her then husband and until this Hon. Court should award the custody of said child to her or to her said quondam husband, and be then desposed of agreeably to such order of this Court</p>

<p>II II</p>
<p>She denies that said respondents have or at any time ever maintained, supported or cared for said child at or out of their individual or sole expense or otherwise

<pb/>
than for pay and compesation in money and she denies that she ever knew or heretofore ever heard of their doing otherwise and she denies that she ever refused or failed or neglected to claim and recognize said child</p>

<p>Second And for answer controverting the so called second cause set up by said respondants in their said return your petitioner says</p>

<p>II</p>
<p>It is not true that she is a pauper or wayward or arbitrary or that she is poor in the extreme or unable or unfit either physically or mentallly to maintain herself and her child or that she is now living on the sufferance of goodly disposed people or other kind of people whomsoever or that she is earning nothing save her bare subsustance or that the said child is wholly dependent for care or maintenance or support upon any person whomsoever save only herself and she denies all such allegations</p>

<p>II II</p>
<p>She denies that the said respondents are or ever were willing to care for

<pb/>

or support the said child for any length of time whatsoever or at all, at their own expense or otherwise than for pay and compensation in money and she denies the sincerity of all such allegatons of willingness to provide gratuitously for said child</p>

<p>Third And for a statement of new matter showing petitioners right to said child your <del></del> petitioner alleges</p>

<p>II</p>
<p>That heretofore court in the year 1885 Your petitioner commenced an action in said District Court at Seattle against her then husband John Powers for a Divorce</p>

<p>II II</p>
<p>That by mutual agreement between her and her said husband and the said respondants said child was left in the care of respondants pending the said suit and until this Court should award the custody of said child to her or her said husband, said child to be delievered into whomsoever the Court should award such custody</p>

<p>II II II</p>
<p>That afterwards towit April 6th 1888 said action terminated and a decree was then

<pb/>
and then rendered by our said District Court granting your petitioner a divorce and awarding to her the sole custody of said child</p>

<p>II V</p>
<p>That afterward Court on the 7th of April 1888 Your petitioners demanded of said respondants the custody of said child which demand was then and there refused and ever since has been so refused</p>

<p>V</p>
<p>That respondants have been paid for their care and keeping of said child by said John Powers and by your petitioner and their retention of said child now is the <del>sole</del> purpose of money and gain</p>

<p>V II</p>
<p>That said respondents have colluded and conspired with the said John Powers through malice and ill will toward your petitioner to defraud her out of the possession of said child and for this reason and for gain as aforesaid they withhold from petitioner the custody of said child and ignore and hold in contempt the authority of this Hon. Court</p>

<p>V II II</p>
<p>That your petitioner never has abandoned

<pb/>
said child but has repeatedly and constantly asked <del>for</del>, demanded, prayed, and implored said respondants and her said quondam husband to be permitted to have the custody and care of said child, all which has been met by the most brutal language and the most inhuman treatment. a bill of <unclear>particulars</unclear> of which inhuman treatment will be forwarded at any time</p>

<p>V II II II</p>
<p>That she is abundantly able to support herself and said child and by her labor is not dependent upon any person or persons whomseover but is as independant as any other person or persons who have to labor for their support and she has many kind friends who treat her far better than she ever was treated by her mother and step father</p>

<p>Fourth And for further cause and ground for relief as herein prayed your said petitioner alleges</p>

<p>II</p>
<p>That the respondents are wholly unfit to have the care or control of said child or any other child because they are immoral in their talk and extremely lewd in their

<pb/>
conversations and very profane in that and that they are ignorant irreligious low vulgar and not respectable in any degree whatsoever and that they have no standing of respectability in the community in which they live and that they are not now and never have been persons of decency or morality for which reasons your petitioner has withdrawn herself from their society and has sought and now continues in the society of reputable and respectable persons</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays for the relief heretofore prayed in her petition filed herein and for costs</p>
<p>Jennie Miller Powers</p>
