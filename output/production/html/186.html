    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In 1903, Charles "Chick" Houghton was arrested in Multnomah County, Oregon, convicted of robbery, and sentenced to five years at the state penitentiary. In 1906, Houghton was granted "conditional clemency," or parole, by the governor and released from prison early with the understanding that he would be returned to finish his sentence if convicted of any crime. He was then arrested again in Multnomah County, convicted of larceny, and returned to the state penitentiary. Houghton appealed this decision to the state supreme court and then filed a writ of habeas corpus in the Marion County Circuit Court, which was granted. Houghton argued that his detention was illegitimate since his conviction was under appeal. After hearing the evidence, the Circuit Court dismissed Houghton's petition and remanded him to the custody of the state penitentiary. Houghton immediately appealed this decision to the state supreme court, too. In early 1907, the state supreme court upheld the lower court's ruling.</li>
