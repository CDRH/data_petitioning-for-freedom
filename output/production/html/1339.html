    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Petitioner Henry Burman was married to Ida in 1879. They had a twelve-year-old daughter named May. When they divorced they agreed that May would remain in the custody of her grandparents, Mary and Stephan Goodell. Petitioner learned that May was in Deadwood, SD with Ida and a man named Walter Steinspring whom she had married and divorced. She remained in Deadwood after their divorce and &#x201C;entered upon a life of easy virtue,&#x201D; working in saloons and keeping the child with her. She allowed the child to &#x201C;act and play&#x201D; at places known as &#x201C;Saloon Theaters.&#x201D; According to the petition, this is where the &#x201C;lowest of the demimonde congregate&#x201D; in the city. Ida temporarily placed May in the care of Mary and Stephan Goodell while she remained in Deadwood. Petitioner stated that he was remarried, had a business and property, and was able to give May a good life. 
Henry alleged that his daughter, May, was being unlawfully deprived of her liberty by Ida Steinspring, Mary Goodell, or Stephan Goodell. Judge Scott determined that Mary and Stephan are suitable people to be entrusted with the care and custody of May Burman but that the listed Ida Steinspring was not a fit or suitable person. The Court ordered that May Burman be remanded back to the custody of Mary and Stephan Goodell and that Henry Burman had the right to visit her. They further ordered that Henry Burman pay the costs of the trial.</li>
