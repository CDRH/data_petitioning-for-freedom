and slaves.</p>
<p> That the said james was born in this territory in
February 1845, ad the said Roxanna somewhere about

solicited your petitioner and his wife Polly to go with
him to Oregon, and represented to your petitioner that
Oregon was a free country, that slavery did not exist
there, and he did not think it ever would. That Respondent
would take your petitioner and his wife Polly
to Oregon if your petitioner and his said wife would on

a share of the gold that he might dig in California.</p>
