<head>NOW A SAGE</head>
<p>Those who happened to have their ears inclined toward the radio receiver on a recent evening may have wondered whether or not Daniel Webster or Henry Clay had returned ot this terrestrial sphere, profoundly to present the issues of today on the rostrum of public opinion. The speaker, in slow, measured accents, in the manner of the statesmen of the ante bellum era, brought to the microphone a novel experience. Deliberate, as if speaking to the crowd at Caesar's funeral, he weighed every word as he carefully constructed its syntax. And who was this meticulous orator? None other than Senator James Hamilton Lewis, who served his political apprenticeship in Seattle, and nearly, if not quite, a quarter of a century ago, went to Chicago at once to become a United States Senator&#8212;and to hold his seat ever since.</p>
<P>Those who knew the Senator in the days when in Seattle he briskly, airily and confidently strung his words together in confounding and confusing his contestants, must have been amazed at his present calm and considerate command of words. It must have been difficult to identity the speaker as the man who came to the State of Washington with the firm determination of becoming a U.S. Senator; and who, thwarted here, turned to Chicago, speedily to reach and retain the place in public affairs upon which he had set his mind.</P>
