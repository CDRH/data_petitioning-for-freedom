    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In June 1887, John Dugan petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on the basis he was unlawfully restrained of his liberty by James Glispin, Sheriff of Spokane County. Dugan was commanded to jail in default of giving $1,500 bail, on the charge of being an accessory to the crime of murder committed upon Frank Teller. The petition alleged there was no evidence that implicated Dugan in said murder and alleges bail was excessive. Judge Turner authorized the petition, and considered the evidence in the case of the Territory v. Mary Teller, and ruled there was not probable cause to sentence Dugan as an accessory to the crime of murder. In addition, Judge Turner reduced bail to $250 to ensure Dugan appears as a witness in said case, then Dugan was to be discharged from custody. </li>
