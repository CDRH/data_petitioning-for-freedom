    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On June 8, 1909, Thomas Johnson was arrested by E. F. Brailey for vagrancy and arraigned in the police court on a plea of guilty. Thomas&#x2019; petition charged that the intent was not to plead guilty - which was made known on June 11, 1909, that he had no representation, that he was not given time to secure witnesses, and that he did not waive his right to trial by jury. He was sentenced to 90 days in county jail by the police court. Johnson also claimed to have been denied his U.S. Constitutional rights in Articles 5 and 6 and denied his rights in Article 1, Sections 3, 5, and 11 of the Constitution of the State of Nebraska. A writ was issued on June 17 but later denied on June 18, 1909.</li>
