         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> I said Ill go and get the horses. I might have said it but I dont remember it - Mr Teller was in the house when I made the remark - and was not doing anything - standing up Teller said let the horses alone he would tend to horses - he should have known for what purpose I was to get the horses - I think I have mentioned to him that night I was going to roll - was going to get them to roll the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">ground[?]</span> he spoke right out in a partly rough way rougher than he usually spoke. Teller done nothing then since he gave me in charge of the place 7 horses - dont hardly know <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> why I did not go and get them not ever having any trouble with Teller preferred not to <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> when Teller forbid me getting the horse - I done nothing then before Teller said she would go and get them - Teller said nothing - she did then start to get the horses dont know how long she was after them not long - dont think 10 or 15 minutes. Horses were out East of the house say 350 or 400 yards. I think she could go in that time I dont know what Teller was doing - I went out to the old house left Teller in main house - <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">that[?]</span> to the old house fix a line on the harness - did not go for horses because I feared difficulty with Mr Teller. There has been a gun kept there prior to the killing all the time - I would know the gun   shown gun  identifies it as the one in the evidence
