    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On January 26th, 1918, Edwin Ekstrom was arrested by an Immigration Inspector on charges issued by the Secretary of Labor, William B. Wilson, alleging that he was an alien, had advocated or taught the unlawful destruction of property, and was likely to become a public charge. On July 5th, 1918, Ekstrom was brought before another Immigration Inspector, S. J. Burford, who took testimony from Ekstrom in which he claimed to not believe in the I.W.W anymore. On November 14th, 1918, a petition was filed which alleged that the questions in the hearing were not material, claims that the Secretary of Labor was taking too long with his immigration status, that there was no evidence for the charges, and that a copy of the hearing transcripts were not being produced for the defense. On November 3rd, 1918, Judge Neterer denied the writ but allowed for resubmission on December 3rd or if being threatened with deportation. On February 10th, 1919, the writ was again denied.</li>
