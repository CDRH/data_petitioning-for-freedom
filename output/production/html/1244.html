    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Elmer Estes petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve his daughter, Rosa May Estes, from the custody of John Kent and a person whom he only as Major Davis, which was granted. Both of the men worked for the Christian Volunteers of America. Rosa May had run away from her home in Kansas City because of trouble with her stepfather, and wanted to stay in Lincoln to do religious work. During the proceedings, Elmer withdrew his petition. This may be because he had tried to secretly take her away on a train to Kansas City the night before, but was caught because his daughter began to scream for help. The fate of Rosa May is unknown. </li>
