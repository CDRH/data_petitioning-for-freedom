    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Fannie Fowle's lawyer (Lewis, James H.) stated in the petition that she was unlawfully restrained against her will by George J. Finleyson (a British citizen). The petitioner believed there was no other cause of her restraint "other than unkindness and willful desire to make a slave" of her. They also cited in the petition that George called her his slave and that she could not leave. Fannie "frequent made attempts to get away" which resulted in the respondent catching her and "severely beat and wound her" for attempting to leave. It is stated she was being held "in the County of King on a Street of said City known as Third Street between what is known as Columbia and Madison Street, just one door from the said Columbia street next to the certain hotel known as the Columbia House." The petition was granted and the writ was served on Finleyson, but there is no further information about her release. </li>
