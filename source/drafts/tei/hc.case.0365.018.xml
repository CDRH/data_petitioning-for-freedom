<p>REPLYING REFER TO
NO. 37012/600</p>

<p>DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS
U.S. COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION
SEATTLE, WASH.</p>

<p>July 29, 1921</p>

<p>Commissioner General of Immigration,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Referring to your file 98793/14, the cause of
JACK MATTHEWS, alias YAN MATVEYEFF, I beg to advise
that I have been informed that the alien has received
a letter from his brother, reading in part, and in
effect as follows,</p>

<p>"South Russia, that is the place where
you want to go, or any part of Russia; even
Siberia, Vlsdivostok. Your birthplace is
Podolska Province of Ukrania, Kaminetz, Podolska."</p>

<p>Commissioner.</p>

SEATTLE, WASH.</p>

<p>July 20, 1921.</p>

<p>Mr. W.W. Husband,
Commissioner General of Immigration,
Washington,
D.C.</p>

<p>Re No.54904-149</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>In reply to your letter of the 14th inst. I beg
to you that you are, I believe, misinformed about certain
very vital matters in the Jack Matthews case.</p>

<p>Matthews is not now serving a sentence in either
the U.S. penintentiart or the county jail but, on the other
hand, is held a prisoner in the county jail solely on the
Department's deportation order of February 19th, 1921, and
has been so held ever since April 4th, 1921, the date of
his release from McNeils Island.</p>

<p>The sole reason for this long delay in accomplishing
his deportation is, as I am informed, the governments
inability to secure passpart to Ukrania, the
country of his nativity, and the country to which he was
ordered deported.</p>

<p>In different letters coming from your department,
you have sometimes referred to Roumaina or Poland as the
country of deportation. These are errors. The country
is Ukrania, and having found that this is the place of his
nativity and having ordered him deported to this place, of
course the department cannot now modify eitherthe finding
or the order, and any attempt to do so would be clearly
arbitrary and would establish a basis for discharge on
habeas corpus.</p>

<p>I am lead to believe that it will be impossible
to secure the passport to Ukrania; in fact I understand that
this government has no diplomatic relations with the goverment</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>of Ukrania. Under these circumstances it seems
to me that the time has already arrived for the application
of the principle declared in both your letters of
the 30th ultimo and 14th inst, viz., that if arrangements
cannot be made for his deportation he should be
released, temporarily at least on his personal recognizance.</p>

<p>I trust that you will forthwith make an order
authorizing such a release. Manifestly, Matthews cannot
submit to perpetual imprisonment in the county jail
on account of your inability to procure passports necessary
to his deportation; and unless you consent to his release
in the manner suggested we will be compelled to apply
for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>

<p>Yours very truly,
Geo. F. Vanderveer.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Commissioner of Immigration,
Seattle, Washington.</p>

<p>Referring to the case of John Matthews, your No.37012/600,
you are advised that the Bureau is in receipt of information
from the Commissioner of Immigration at Ellis Island, N.Y.H.,
to th effect that he unable to secure a Polish passport for
this man. It appears to the Bureau that this alien is really a
a native and subject of Ukrania and there is transmitted herewith
an application for Ukrainian passport, and it is requested
that you have this filled in and return to the Bureau together
with a copy of the hearing in this case, when an effort will be
made to secure a Ukranian passport.</p>

<p>Assistant Commissioner General.

<p>OFFICE OF
COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION
ELLIS ISLAND
NEW YORK HARBOR, N.Y.</p>

<p>98793/14</p>

<p>July 22nd, 1921</p>

<p>Commissioner- General of Immigration,
Washington D.C.,</p>

<p>Please refer to Bureau file 54904/149 relating
to the case of Jack Matthews, or John Matthews, alias Yan
Matveyeff.</p>

<p>The Polish Coneul in New York refuses to issue
a passport for this alien, on the ground that no satisfactory
information has been furnished as to the alien's place of birth.
It will be noted from the enclosed correspondence that no
exact information is available as to the place of alien's birth.
It appears also from the record of hearing, that he may be a
native of Ukrainia.</p>

<p>Enclosed correspondence is therefore, referred
to the Bureau, in order that an effort may be made to secure a
passport from te Ukrainian representative or such other action
as you may use fit to take.</p>
