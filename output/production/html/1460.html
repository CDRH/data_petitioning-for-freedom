    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On 23 September 1914, a complaint was filed against Madge and Frank Howard by Fred W. Anheuser which stated that they were keeping an ill-governed house. In a petition filed on 10 October 1914, Madge Howard states to the court that she was tried and convicted of keeping an ill governed house, in violation of the Nebraska statutes. She was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 and costs. She filed this petition to show to the court that the charge does not constitute an offense under the Statutes of Nebraska and , thus, that all of the following proceedings were unlawful and that she was being unjustly and unlawfully deprived of her liberty. Her petition asks the court to issue a writ of Habeas Corpus and discharge her from said unlawful imprisonment. The Court&#x2019;s Appearance Docket notes that the writ was accepted and Madge was discharged from custody on 21 October 1914.</li>
