    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Nelson Davis married Sarah Magdalene Fryer on July 23, 1874 in Columbia County, Washington. Four years later, they had a daughter, Maggie M. Davis. While the couple was living with Nelson's four children from a previous marriage, Maggie was Maggie and Nelson's only child. However, on November 19, 1888, Sarah left Nelson, taking the 11-year old Maggie with her. On November 27, 1888, Nelson filed a petition for a writ of habeus corpus against Sarah, stating that he should have custody of Maggie, as he had a house and the resources to care for her. Judge William A. Langford allowed the writ, which was returnable December 14, 1888. No further records exist of the case, although by 1910, Nelson was living at his son-in-law's house. </li>
