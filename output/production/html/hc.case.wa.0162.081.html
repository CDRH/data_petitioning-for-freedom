      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington<br/>
County of Spokane} ss</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I, George Wycoff,
being duly sworn, on my
oath depose and say that 
I now do reside and for the past
six years have resided
in Waverly Precinct
near Rattler's Run in Spokane 
County, Washington
Territory. That my place
of residence is well
known to the people
of that part of Spokane 
County. That I have
resided continously at
my home at said place
ever since the time of
the killing of James Finch
in June last, except about
one month from the tenth
day of August to the tenth
day of September A.D. 1886,
and during that time
I was at the place in
Whitman County about
twenty miles from my said
home in Spokane County.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That I have been in
attendance upon the district
court, now in session in
the city of Spokane Falls

<span class="hr"> </span>

ever since and including
the tenth day of December
1886, in obedience to a 
<del>summons</del> subpoena
therefrom. That during
all the time since the
killing of James Finch
I have never concealed
my self and might
have been found by the
sheriff of Spokane County,
or any other person, by
ordinary means.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I further depose
and say that I was
present at the killing
of James Finch, in
the house of Ray Raymond, 
in the city of
Spokane Falls, on or
about the 26th day of
June A.D. 1886. That T.
Donaldson was also present 
at said killing.
That it is not true that
said T. Donaldson or this
affiant were in a position
at that time, where
they or either of them could
not see and hear the
transactions relating to
the killing of James Finch.

<span class="hr"> </span>

That said T. Donaldson was
in a situation to hear
and see substantially
all that was done at
such killing, and this
affiant was in a position 
to hear substantially
all that was done and
to see part of the house action 
and no person and that Charles Wilson
was not present in the
room where affiant was
at the time of the said
killing. That affiant did
not see or hear him
there at all and verily
believes he was not
a witness to any of
the transaction.</p>

before me this 10th day
of December A.D. 1886</p>
