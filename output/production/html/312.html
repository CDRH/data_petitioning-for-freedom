    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On July 13, 1857, Michael Broderick petitioned on behalf of five men (whose names are unknown) who he believed to be subjects of Queen Victoria that were being detained at the U. S. Military Port by Major George Haller. The bound parties were allegedly being held on the charge of desertion of the Satellite (Queen Victoria&#x2019;s ship). That same day, Judge Chenoweth ordered Major Haller to bring the bound parties before the court. On July 14, Major Haller responded to the petition and alleged that the bound parties deserted the Satellite and that it was his duty to &#x201C;in the waters of the sound in connection with and as a part of the joint campaign of the governments of Great Britain and the United States to ascertain land determine the boundary between&#x201D; the two governments. Major Haller further detailed that the Satellite's officer in command asked him to detain the bound parties until he could send for them. The fate of the bound parties is unknown. </li>
