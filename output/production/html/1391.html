    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Carl O. Nelson is the father of Georgia Catherine Nelson, a three-year-old girl in the custody of her grandmother, Pearl Nelson. Pearl was Carl's mother, but Carl filed for a writ of Habeas Corpus against Pearl, claiming she is holding his daughter illegally. Pearl stated that young Georgia has been under her care since Georgia's mother passed away because Carl had consented for Pearl to adopt Georgia; however, the adoption was never done. Carl recently remarried after the passing of Georgia's mother and argued that he and his new wife would provide a stable and loving household for Georgia. The courtroom debate got heated: Carl's sister, in the audience, stood up and said "He is not entitled to this child. Look at what he did to his first wife," after which Pearl burst into tears.The judge agreed and granted Carl a writ of habeas corpus, ordering Pearl to release the child from her custody. </li>
