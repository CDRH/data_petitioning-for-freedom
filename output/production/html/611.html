    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On March 4th, 1922 Gladys Jackson petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Paul Epperson. The nature of the relationship between Gladys and Paul is unknown. Gladys alleged that Paul was being unlawfully detained because he was not being held by virtue of any warrant, commitment, mittimus, or court order. She also claimed that he was held for more than seventy-two hours without the filing of any complaint or information against him. She named Michael Dempsey as the respondent. The judge issued the petition. Michael Dempsey filed a return, citing that he detained Paul Epperson at the request of Governor Samuel McKelvie, the governor of Nebraska. McKelvie issued a warrant for Paul's arrest on behalf of the governor of Illinois, Len Small. Paul Epperson was charged with burglary in Illinois and considered to be a fugitive from justice. On March 6th, the writ was denied and Paul remained in the custody of Michael Dempsey. He presumably returned to Illinois.</li>
