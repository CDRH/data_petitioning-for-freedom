    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On January 14, 1919, Ruth Morrisson petitioned for a writ of Habeas Corpus, claiming that the chief of police, Marshall Eberstein, was unlawfully detaining her of her liberty. She stated that on January 3, she was arrested and placed in the Omaha City Jail. However, no charges were filed against her, and no fixed bond for her release was set. The same day, the Judge accepted the petition and filed a writ of habeas corpus. On January 16, Ernest T. Manning, City Health Commissioner, sent an answer and return of the writ, claiming that he determined that Morrison was infected with a communicable venereal virus, and for that reason, he ordered that she be isolated and quarantined in the Detention Home for treatment. The outcome of this proceeding is unknown. </li>
