<p>4. That said ordinances now are and ever since the date of their</p>

<p>5. That on the 5th day of September, 1901, the above named

hawk certain goods, wares and merchandise, to-wit:</p>

quaker herbs for sale in said City and by selling the same at public
out-cry in a public place therein as more fully appears from the
complaint for the violation of said ordinances, a copy of which is
to this return attached.</p>

<p>6. That thereupon a complaint, for the violation of said ordinances

a copy of which judgment is hereto attached, marked exhibit "D"</p>

<pb/>

<p>and made a part of this return.</p>

<p>9. that said relator having failed and refused to pay said fine

of the Peace, as aforesaid, and placed in the hands of this respondent
and thereupon by virtue of the commands therein contained, did
take said relator into custody on the 6th day of September, 1901,
and placed him in the City jail of the City of North Yakima, a copy
of which commitment is hereto attached, marked exhibit "E" and made
<del></del> a part of this return.</p>

<p>10. That said relator so remained in jail until the 7th day of

discharged said relator from custody and never since said time has
the said John G. Boyle had the custody or control of said relator
nor has he imprisoned him nor restrained him of his liberty nor has
he had the said relator in his possession, custody or power since
said date and he now has no power, custody or control over him. </p>

<p>11. Said respondent further shows that said writ of habeas corpus
was served upon him on the 7th day of September, 1901, at the hour
of four o'clock P.M. That respondent had no notice, <del>power</del> prior to
said date and did not at said date, nor at any other time prior to
the time the same was served upon him, have any notice or knowledge
that said writ or any writ of habeas corpus has been issued.</p>

<p>12. That this respondent does not hold said relator by virtue of 
said commitment or by process of any Court whatever but pursuant to
the commands in said writ of habeas corpus named, the respondent
with the full consent and at the express request of said relator and
with the full knowledge on the part of the said relator, of all the
facts herein stated, and in order to obey said writ of habeas corpus
in so far as it was in the power of this respondent so to do, has
brought said relator into this Court by virtue of said writ of habeas
corpus and not otherwise and has brought <add>said relator</add> into Court at his express
request and with his full consent and with his full knowledge, that

engaged in the sale of what are generally known as patent

from town to town and offering the same at public
outcry upon the streets and public places of various towns
visited by him; that said relator carries with him a travelling
troup of players, and gives open air concerts for 
the purpose of attracting corwds of people, in order to be
able to more readily sell his wares; that he is engaged in
the sale of what is known as "Quaker Herbs", "Pile Remedies"
and shaving soap; that the method of conducting the business
of said relator attracts large crowds of people on the
streets, thoroughfares and public places where said business
is carried on; that by reason thereof the said City of North
Yakima is put to large additional expense in policing said
city and preserving the public peace and good order therein.</p>

<p>14-- Said relator, as this respondent is informed and
believes and therefore alleges, sells large quantities of
the medicines and nostrums aforesaid at an enormous profit,
and this respondent averts that said relator can well afford
from the profits made and the quantitites of medicine sold
to pay the license in said ordinance mentioned.</p>

<p>15-- That said relator ships said medicines and nostrums
into the State of Washington in original packages, and
thereafter and when the same are offered for sale, he breaks
said packages and offers the same for sale at retail in
single packages and not in the packages so shipped in.</p>

<p>16-- Respondent further making return to said writ, denies
that said relator is unlawfully imprisoned, detained and
fined or restrained of his liberty by respondent at North</p>

<pb/>

<p>Yakima or elsewhere; denies that he has any knowledge or 
information sufficient to form a belief as to whether said
relator is a resident and citizen of the City of Portland
in the State of Oregon; denies that he has any knowledge or

or information sufficient to form a belief as to what said
medicine is composed of, and as to whether it is not composed
of the products of the soil or vegetables of Yakima County;

medicine and quaker herbs and nostrums are grown in various
States of the United States other than the State of Washington;
denies that said relator was detained by respondent
under said committment at the time of the granting of said
writ; denies that the sum of Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00)
is a prohibitive and unreasonable license, and that Twenty-
five Dollars ($25.00) per day is a prohibitive and unreasonable
license; denies that the net profits from the sale of
said medicine would not equal said license; and denies
that the effect of said license is to prohibit petitioner
from doing business in the City of North Yakima; and denies
that it infringes his right under the Constitution of the
United States to engage in business in North Yakima upon
equal terms with the persons selling the products of Yakima
County, and that it interferes with the right of commerce
as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States
between the citizens of different states; denies that said
ordinance is in violation of the Constitution and laws of the</p>

State of the Union like privileges, rights and immunities
in every other State of said Union had by the citizens
of said State.</p>

<pb/>

<p>14. That respondent respectfully protests against the jursidiction
of this Court and respectfully avers that the matters and things
aforesaid do not show a violation of the constitution of the laws
of the United States.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE respendent prays that said writ of habeas corpus be
quashed and that said petition be dismissed and that he recover his 
costs.</p>
