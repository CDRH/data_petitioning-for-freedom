In the District Court holding terms at Seattle

In Re Application of Thomas Gilbert and Catherine Gilbert for a Writ of Habeas Corpus}

To the Honorable Richard A Jones Judge of said Court:

The Petitioners Thomas Gilbert and Catharine Gilbert would most respectfully allege
and show unto your Honor that they are each imprisoned confined and disposed of their
liberty by William Cochoran, Sheriff of the said County of King at Seattle in said
county in this Territory

That said imprisonment is illegal and that the illegality thereof consists in the
following facts: On May 27 1888, these petitioners were arrested and brought before
one N. Soderberg a Justice of the Peace in and for the Seattle Precinct in said King
County on a charge of disposing of beer to



an Indian that on said day a hearing or pretended trial was had before said N. Soderberg
and that these petitioners were on said day ordered to pay a fine of $100- by said
Justice and in default of the payment of the same were by him committed in said day,
to the Jail of said County for the period of fifty days.

That these petitioners have been so confined in said Jail for the full period of said
fifty days and four days in excess therof and are now entitled to be set at liberty

That these petitioners have had but one trial before said N. Soderberg and have suffered
the full term of punishment by imprisonment ordered in said cause, but that said Soderberg
has issued duplicate warrants of commitments is said cause as these petitioners believe.

That the Judgements upon which said warrants of commitments now issued are null and
void and that said warrants of commitments are each null and void all of which will
appear by an 



inspection thereof.

That true and correct copies of the said commitments by which said William Cochoran
claims to hold these petitioners are herto attached and marked respectfully "Exhibit
A" and "Exhibit B" respectively and are hereby made a part of this petition

Wherefore these petitioners pray that a writ of Habeas Corpus issue directed to the
said William Cochoran commanding him to produce the bodies of petitioners before your
Honor at a time and place therein to be stated and then and three do and receive what
the Court may order concerning petitioners, and that he the said Cochoran have then
and there the said writ and make due return of the date and time of the imprisonments
of petitioners and then and there produce the warrant of commitments by which he now
holds petitioners
