    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Mrs. James T. Dickey, the mother of 17-year-old Edna and 13-year-old Geraldine Sullivan, petitioned for a writ of habeus corpus to gain custody of the girls on August 10, 1920.The writ was directed at Mother Saint Lawrence, the Mother Superior of the House of the Good Shepherd, a convent and home for "delinquent girls" in Omaha. The girls' deceased father had placed the girls there before his death, and the Mother Superior refused to relinquish the sisters to their mother's custody. According to the Omaha Daily Bee, shortly after Mr. Dickey's death, his wife remarried and moved to Washington, D.C. The writ was successful, and when the girls appeared in court on August 11, judge Willis G. Sears granted Mrs. Dickey custody, although they had originally scheduled to appear before judge A.C. Troup. Allegedly, when the verdict was announced, the girls cried, hugging the representative sent with them from the convent and said that they didn't want to go.</li>
