<p>In the matter of

<p>Petition</p>

<p>To the Honorable Roger S.

for the third judicial District of

at Seattle. -</p>

<p>1
Your petitioner Michael
Henan humbly represents to your
Honor that he is unlawfully
restrained of his liberty by J.H.
McGraw Sheriff and jailer of said
King County, and at the jail in the
said County; the said jail being
the County jail-</p>

<p>2
That the cause or
pretense of your petitioners restraint
is a charge of grand larceny,
of which your petitioner avers
that he is not guilty.</p>

<p>3
That the illegality of
your petitioners restraint consists</p>


<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0414.003"/>

<p>in detaining your petitioner without
evidence or facts sufficient to
justify the same.</p>

<p>4
That your petitioner is a
young man and is desirous of
establishing his innocence at an
early a date as possible. -</p>

<p>5
That your petitioner is ill
&amp; very ill in the said jail, -
your petitioner being sorely -
afflicted with a complaint which
will, added to much longer
imprisonment to wit on the
October term of your Honors sitting
surely bring about such woful
consequences that your petitioner
cannot ever recover  from the
effects of the same. -</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner
prays this Honorable Court  
to grant unto him the gracious
Writ of Habeas Corpus
commanding the said J.H. McGraw
Sheriff and jailer as aforesaid
to produce the body of this your
petitioner before your honor</p>


<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0414.004"/>

<p>on same day certain, and also
command the said J H McGraw
to summon + bring forth the
witnesses charging your petitioner
with the offense for which he
is deprived of his liberty, + then
+ there at such time as named
by your honor, to enquire wherefore
this your petitioner is so
illegaly restrained of his liberty
and your petitioner
will pray for discharge etc.</p>
