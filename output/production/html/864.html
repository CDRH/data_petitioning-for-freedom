    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On the 25th of November 1924, William J. Fox filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus on the grounds of being unlawfully in confinement and deprived of his liberty by Dennis H. Cronin and William C. Condit. He was being held in custody on the basis of having sold liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act with a sentence of three months and a fine of $400. In his petition, Fox presented that he had been held longer than the three months, the court agreed and discharged him from custody. In December 1924 an appeal was made by Cronin and Condit, filing assignments of error within it and then was granted. In February 1926 it was ordered by the Circuit Court of Appeals that the order made in November 1924 allowing the discharge of Fox be reversed with recommendation to discharge the writ for habeas corpus and remand Fox to custody which was carried out three days later.</li>
