      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable Edward E. Cushman,
Judge of the above entitled Court:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The petition of Marie Miler respectfully shows:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">That she, the said Marie Miler, is a citizen of the
Empire of Austria, a duly organized Empire of Europe, with treatise
of peace, commerce and intercourse with the United States
of America.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">II.</p>

came to the United States, where she has resided since.
That during all of said time she has conducted herself as a good citizen should do.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">III.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">That on or about the 1st day of January <span class="tei_add">1913,</span> more than
three years after her arrival in the United States, she was complained
against by the immigration service at Seattle, Washington,
under the direction of the Hon. Ellis DeBruler, United States
Commissioner of Immigration. That certain proceedings were
had on or about the 18th day of March, 1913, the petitioner was
ordered deported and sent from the United States of America,

by counsel. That she had retained counsel before the hearing
and had paid him a reasonable and substantial fee, that he had
failed to appear and represent her at any time during the proceeding
and has not seen her or consulted with her since receiving 
his retainer from her. That she does not understand the English
language and had no opportunity of protecting or knowing what
her legal rights were. That the evidence on which she was
ordered deported was a false affidavit which the applicant had
no opportunity to controvert, owing to the fact that counsel
whom she had retained did nothing after receiving compensation
from her toward protecting her rights. That the affidavit was
made by a party with who she had been in partnership in the
City of Seattle and against who she had an motion pending for
a recievership and accounting and that the affidavit and the
charges preferred by that party and other conspirators likely
interested with him, was a conspiracy on their part to get rid
of the petitioner and acquire her property.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">V.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">That the petitioner as a citizen of the Empire of
Austria, an Empire having treatise with the United States, is
entitled to a trial in the civil and criminal courts of the
United States of America, and which she has not had, and, as
aforesaid, is about to be deported without due process of law
as well an without being given an opportunity to be heard and
based on a fraudulent conspiracy to force her out of the 
country and deprive her of her rights, both financial and 
physical.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">VI.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">That your applicant and petitioner is about to be
deported on April 16th, 1913, and unless a writ of Habeas Corpus
issues she will be deported and forever barred from having a
hearing as to her legal rights, with due respect to her property
and liberty, and in futherance of the conspiracy of her 
enemies.</p>
