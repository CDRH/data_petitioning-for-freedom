<head>Pioneer Judges and Lawyers</head>
<ab>Introduction:</ab>
<p>The Northwest frontier shaped everything and everyone that came in contact with it, including the law, lawyers and judges. Jurists and lawyers faced discomfort and danger as they "rode the circuit" through the sparsely settled region, bringing both justice and entertainment to isolated communities. Courtroom facilities were often crude, and standards of justice then were often very different from those of today. Knowledge of the law was sometimes lacking, but frontier justice was not always based on what the law said.</p>
<p>John J. McGilvra had more legal training than most lawyers in the area when President Lincoln appointed him U.S. Attorney for Washington Territory in 1861. McGilvra was also an astute observer of men and events. In the early 1890's he wrote the following article about some of the pioneer judges and lawyers of Washington. It was published as a chapter in Rev. Harvey K. Hines' Illustrated History of Washington.</p>

<head>Early Washington Bar</head>
<p>In ascending the Columbia river from Vancouver to Walla Walla on the old steamer "Okanogan," we were wrecked at the John Day's Rapids, and had to lie there for three days and until the steamer "George S. Wright" came up the river. In making a sharp turn in the river at that point, the current caught the bow of the boat, and threw it around and back down stream, where one of the compartments in the hull was caught on a sharp protruding rock, and the vessel was there held careened sidewise at an angle of over thirty degrees until after we left her. Stil, we had plenty to eat and plenty of blankets, so that all hands were made comfortable on board or on shore, as the passengers chose. We had a boat and spent much of the time fishing in the John Day's river. Colonel A.C. Gibbs, a member of the Portland Bar and afterward Governor of the State of
<pb/>
Oregon, was the Izaak Walton of our party.</p>
<p>In due time we arrived at Walla Walla, at that time a veritable mining town. Every public house was a gambling saloon, and gambling was as open as daylight. In fact, the foreman of the jury was Colonel Stone, of the firm of Stone &amp; Ball, the principal gambling house in town. Colonel Stone was not only a good member of the grand jury in general, but when the question came up of indicting the gambling houses he voted for it every time.</p>
<p>The court was held in the second story or loft of one of these gambling houses, approached by outside stairs, and it was one of the most, if not the most, primitive temples of justice that ever existed in any country. The building was constructed of hewed sticks of timber, clapboarded on the outside but entirely unfinished on the inside. The naked, hewed logs at the sides, and the rought joists and rafters overhead was the inside finsih.</p>
<p>Some Indians had killed a Frenchman six or seven miles from Walla Walla few days before court convened, and while court was in session one of the Indians arrested confessed, and offered to conduct the sheriff
<pb/>
to the spot where the body was buried. As the event was an important one, the court adjourned, and the sheriff, judge and prosecuting attorney, and others, accompanied the Indian to the spot indicated, where, sure enough, we found the body buried at the roots of a tree, about a foot under ground.</p>
<p>The Frenchman was a returned miner who had been camping near where his body was found, and the motive for the killing was money; but we found $500 in gold coin fastened under one arm, beneath his clothing which the murderers had failed to find.</p>
<p>There was no jail in the county then and the accused Indians, two in number, were manacled and chained to staples driven in the walls of the court room. The attorneys' seats were common benches, and there was one small table in the room, which in the evening was sometimes used by the attorneys for a social game of cards. The cards were deposited for safe keeping during the day one the judge's desk, which was an old-fashioned wash-stand.</p>
<p>One day, during the session of court, one of the Indian prisoners, by getting the length of his chain from the wall, and reaching well out, got possession of the cards, and during the balance of the day's session the Indians
<pb/>
enjoyed themselves in a series of social games. A cut of that scene would make a good view for one of our magazines.</p>
<p>The United States attorney and his immediate predecessor, Butler P. Anderson, in September, 1861, traveled together from Olympia to Vancouver to attend that term of the court. At Burbank's Hotel, at Monticello, the shipping point for Portland and Vancouver, they met some returning miners who had two Cayuse ponies with saddles and bridles for sale at twenty-five dollars for each horse, with the saddle and bridle. The horses had been turned out to pasture, but as the saddles and bridles were worth about that sum, the ex-United States attorney and successor purchased the outfits. Anderson returned first, and of course had his choice as to ponies; whether he got the best one or not was never known, but the one left was not of much account, and on the return, at Jackson's, a half day's ride from Monticello, gave out and the attorney traded him off for another, giving five dollars to boot. At Pumphry's twelve miles further on, he again traded, getting seven and a half dollars to boot, and at Van Warmers', thirty miles from Olmpia, sold his poney for twenty-five dollars,
<pb/>
took his saddle and bridle and went on to Olympia in the stage for $2.50, having cleared the saddle bridle in the operation.</p>
<p>Anderson, who was a Mississippian and a brother of General Patterson Anderson, soon returned to the South, also, and it is believed entered the Confederate army, but the writer is not certain as to that.</p>
<p>The winter of 1861 and two was the hardest ever known in this country, either before or since that time. Snow commenced to fall on Christmas, 1861, and lay on the ground until April, 1862.</p>
<p>The terms of court were so arranged at that time with reference to the convenience of the United States Marshal and attorney that the last term in the spring and the first terms in the fall should be held east of the Cascade mountains. Consequently the writer, as United States attorney, was required to spend the summer in Eastern Washington.</p>
<p>A light, covered spring-wagon and a good span of Indian ponies were considered the best means of transporation for himself and family consisting of a wife and two small children, as there was no rail and but little water transportation on the lines to be traversed. Conse-
<pb/>
quently, about the middle of March, thus equipeed, we started from Olympia to make the portage to Columbia river through snow and mud. At about thirty miles from Olympia we had to employ an extra team, and at Pymphry's Landing, on the Cowlitz, we had to ship the wife, babies and wagon on two canoes lashed together, taking through the deep snow, and meeting again at Monticello, at which point we shipped on board a steamer for Vancouver, landing, however, about six miles below Vancouver at a point opposite the mouth of the Willamette, as the steamer was bound for Portland.</p>
<p>After attending a term of court at Vancouver, we again shipped for the Dalles, and from that place followed the old stage road to Walla Walla.</p>
<p>At Butter creek our horses were stolen, and we went into Walla Walla with a mule and a sore-backed poney hired for the occasion from some miners en route for the Boise and Oro Fino country. A reward was offered for the ponies, and while attending the court at Walla Walla they were returned to use not much the worse for wear, but plainly marked by packsaddles. They had been packed to the Powder River mines.</p>
<pb/>
<p>We afterward went to Lewiston and the Lapwai Indian Reservation, and also to Colville, with this same outfit, and finally traded it off for a house and lot in Walla Walla and went to housekeeping. We bought a cook-stove, carpet, and some old-fashioned wooden-bottomed chairs, all we could obtain in Walla Walla; out bedsteads, tables, etc., we made ourselves, and with calico window curtains, and such other things to match as we could make or purchase, we were not only comfortable but cozy.</p>
<p>Wehn we arrived at Walla Walla, being a United States official, we were invited to take possession of some vacant officers' quarters, which we gladly did, and on starting out for Lewiston at the close of the term of Court, the Quarter Master loaned us a good wall-tent with a fly, and after that we had comfortable quarters whenever we camped.</p>
<p>At Lewiston, which was then literally a city of tents, we had one of the best houses in town.</p>
<p>Lewiston, which was a mining town, was situated upon the Lapwai Reservation, but spirituous liquors and wine, as well as malt liqours, were brought in by the cargo, notwithstanding the Indian intercourse act making 
<pb/>
it a crime punishable by both fine and imprisonment to take spiritous liqour or wine into the Indian country.</p>
<p>Early in July, 1862, Judge Oliphant, Selucius Garfielde, Shell Fargo, Chalie Allen, the butler at Walla Walla military post, and myself started from Walla Walla to Colville for the purpose of holding a term of the district court, the first ever held at the latter place. We had the ponies and wagon already described and two riding mules. The distance was 210 miles, and there was no inhabitant on the road except a ferryman at the crossing of the Snake river and another at the crossing of the Spokane, about eighteen miles below the present city of Spokane.</p>
<p>We carried our grub and slept under two small fly tents. Garfielde was a good cook, having had more experience then the rest of us. A frying-pan and coffee-pot composed our cooking outfit. We baked our bread in the frying-pan, broiled our bacon before the fire on sharpened sticks, catching the drippings on our fresh-baked bread, and settled our coffee with cold water, using buffalo chips mostly for fuel. The bread, bacon and coffee on that trip had a relish that 
<pb/>
it has seldom been the good fortune of the writer to enjoy.</p>
<p>On the route, and somewhere near Medical Lake, we met the Colville garrison, consisting of regular troops ordered east, having been relieved by Oregon and Washington volunteers. The officers, of course, had some good commissary whisky along, of which we were invited to partake.</p>
<p>Shell Fargo was the teamster, and although it was not observed that he had appropriated more than his share of the commissary, it was not long after we had parted company with the soldiers before he upset the wagon and spilled out his passengers, Judge Oliphant and Salucius Garfielde.</p>
<p>Garfielde was smoking at the time, and Fargo always insisted that he never lost his hold or ceased to puff on that old pipe; Garfielde was a man not easily disturbed; but not so with Oliphant; although not hurt, his nerves were considerably shaken up.</p>
<p>Upon arrivign at Colville we were offered quarters at the military post. Park Winnan was appointed clerk of the court; the sheriff summoned a grand and petit jury and the business of the term commenced. No court
<pb/>
having been before organized and this being the first term, of course there were no cases on the docket. The people of Colville had looked forward to the first term of the court with a good deal of interest and were anxious to make a good showing with a view to regular terms thereafter. Consequently the grand jury indicted every one suspected of doing wrong, and all the people who had disputes to settle came into court, waived the service of process, made up the issues in their causes and went to trial. The result was that several criminal and civil cases were tried, two or three divorces granted, and Garfielde andy myself made about $750 each.</p>
<p>Shell Fargo was appointed United States Marshal.</p>
<p>During this term of court all hands went over to the Hudson Bay Post, about fifteen miles north of Colville, then in charge of McDonald. This Hudson Bay Post was near the Kettle Falls in the Columbia river, and at these falls were the principal fisheries of the upper Columbia, from which several tribes of Indians derived their main sustenance.
<pb/>
When we were there several acres of ground were occupied by drying and smoking the salmon already caught.</p>
<p>On the return trip from Colville to Walla Walla Judge Oliphant was very anxious to get sight of a coyote, as we could hear them in the distance nearly every night. The last night before reaching Walla Walla, we camped on the Touchet, where we got some oats in the sheaf for our horses, which were picketed out near our tents. In the night we heard a racket among the horses and I got up and went out to see what the trouble was. I found several Indian ponies, called "cayuses," taking the feed from our own ponies, which intruders I drove away and then returned to bed. Garfielde asked what was the matter, and I replied that there were a lot of cayuses around, when up jumped Judge Oliphant and enquired, "Where are they? where are they?" I replied that they were just outside not far from our animals. Out the Judge went, half dressed, but after a short time returned saying that he could not see any cayuses. Garfielde remarked that probably they had gone away, and that "you never could find that breed of Indian ponies when you wanted 
<pb/>
them, anyway!" At that, Oliphant, who had gotten into bed again, raised up and shrieked "Ponies! Ponies! I though you said they were [coyotes."] When Oliphant finally saw the joke that had been played on him, he was as much out of humor as such a good soul could be, and didn't speak to any of us for several days, unless he was obliged to!</p>
<p>Judge Oliphant was an elderly man, of large frame and equally large heart, unaccustomed to the rough ways of the Western wilds, and he soon tired of his position as Judge. After holding terms of court at Oro Fino and Boise City among the miners, who carried their revolvers in the court-room as elsewhere, the Judge resigned to take a clerkship in the General Land Office in Washington city, where he could live in peace and quiet, and there spent the balance of his days.</p>
<p>In consequence of the obliging disposition of Judge Oliphant and his desire to please everyone, and especially the attorneys, he sometimes got himself into an awkward predicament.</p>
<p>During the fall term of 1862 at Walla Walla, Judge Lander^2 and General Bridges were
<pb/>
pitted against each other in a cause that came up for hearing on demurrer.</p>
