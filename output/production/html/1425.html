    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On July 21, 1919, Wade Gregory and Clarence J. Burress, two brothers-in-law, allegedly stole a car in Omaha, Nebraska. At some point, they left for St. Joseph, Missouri, where Burress had family, and it was there that they were arrested without a warrant on August 26 by Charles Van Deusen, an Omaha policeman. A warrant for their arrest wasn't issued until September 9. They were taken through Iowa to Omaha, and incarcerated in Douglas County Jail, and Douglas County sheriff wrote to the governor on August 30 for extradition. At some point, they tried to pay a bail of $2,500, but defaulted. On September 13, 1919, while still being held in Douglas County, they filed a writ of habeus corpus. This writ was accepted by judge WIlliam A. Redick, and he asked Clark to justify why the men were being held in a hearing on September 19, 1919. On September 22, 1919, their application was denied, and the men were remanded to the custody of the Douglas County sheriff. </li>
