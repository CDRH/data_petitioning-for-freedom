    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On October 19th, 1921, Otto F. Lindner petitioned for and was given an order allowing a writ of Habeas Corpus having been taken and held in custody by Micheal F. Dempsey and Charlse Van Deusen in October of that year. Van Deusen and Dempsey presented in response that their holding of Lindner was by virtue of a warrant issued by the governor of Nebraska that was originally from the governor of Illinois that charged Lindner with non-support of wife and child and being a fugitive from justice. In replying to the response, Linder argued that he was not a fugitive from justice and was in Nebraska for his job as a traveling salesman and that his wife and child were well supported and aware of his travels. It was the 21st of the same month that the judge ordered the writ denied and Lindner be remanded to custody. Linder filed for a new trial the day after. The fate of Lindner is unknown. </li>
