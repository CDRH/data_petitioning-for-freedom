<p>Territory of Washington County of Spokane S.S.</p>

<p>In the matter of the application of Mary E. Teller for a writ of Habeas Corpus:</p>

<p>To the Hon. George Turner Judge of the District Court of the 4th Judicial District of Washington Territory</p>

<p>The petition of Mary E. Teller respectfully shows to your honor that she is unlawfully imprisoned, detained, confined and restrained of her liberty by R D Raridon the sheriff of Lincoln County in Washington Territory. That said sheriff petitions to hold your petitioner in custody under and by virtue of a commitment issued by Hon John J Booge a Justice of the Peace within and for said county of Spokane. Commanding said sherriff to hold your petitioner in custody in default of her entering into bail in the sum of 

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0001.002"/>

five thousand dollars for her appearance at the next regular term of the District Court to be held within and for said County of Spokane then and there to answer to the charge of murder. Your petitioner further represents that she is not guilty of said offense; and that the amount of bail required for her appearance to answer to said charge is excessive.</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays that a writ of Habeas Corpus may be granted directed to the said Judge Glispen commanding him to have the body of your petitioner before your honor at a time and place therein to be specified, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered by your Honor concerning her together with the time and cause of her detention and said writ. And that she may be restored to her liberty; or that in the event your Honor 

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0001.003"/>

should think it right and proper she should be held to bail for her appearance to answer said charge. That you will reduce the amount of said bail so as to make it within her power to gain the required security.</p>

<p>Dated AD 1887</p>

<p>Turner and Forten attys for petitioner</p>

<p>Territory of Washington County of Lincoln S.S.</p>

<p>Mary E. Teller being duly sworn makes oath and says that she is the person named as petitioner in the above and foregoing petition, That she has heard said petition read and knows the contents thereof and that the same is true as she verily believes</p>

<p>Mary E. Teller</p>
<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 11th day of July 1887 Wm <unclear/> Chandler Probate Judge of Lincoln County W.T.</p>
