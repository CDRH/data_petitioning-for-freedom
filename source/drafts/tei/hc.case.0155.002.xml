<p>In the United States Circuit Court for the State of Washington Ninth Judicial Circuit, Holding Terms at Seattle</p>

<p>In the matter of the Petition of Charles W. Nordstrom for Writ of Habeas Corpus and relief thereon
       vs.
       Edward Cudihee, a citizen of the State of Washington and Sheriff of King County</p>

<p>To the Honorable Judges of the above named Circuit Court:</p>

<p>Your petitioner Charles W. Nordstrom by his attorney James Hamilton Lewis respectfully showeth: That I petitioner
       Charles W. Nordstrom is a forced resident of the United States and is a man over the age of twenty-one years and
       petitioner is a subject of the Kingdom of Sweden and a citizen of Sweden and an alien. That he is incarcerated in
       prison in King County, State of Washington at the City of Seattle. That he is being wrongfully detained in prison by
       the sheriff of King County Edward Cudahee, respondent. That respondent is a resident and citizen of the State of
       Washington, County of King and a citizen of the United States. That said imprisonment is illegal and the restraint
       is contrary to the Constitution of the United States and in violation of the laws of the United States.</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>That the said petitioner is held as he is informed and believes by the respondent with the intent that he shall be further 
       held for the purpose of taking his life; to-wit, to execute him, or having this petitioner executed and for the purpose of 
       having some Judge in the County of King name a day and sing a paper known as a Death Warrant for the purpose of 
       naming and setting a day upon which this petitioner shall be executed and the said person named in the said paper
       to be orded to execute this petitioner; whereas, as your petitioner alleges there is no law for such action and no law
       for such action and now law in the State of Washington or in the</p>

<pb/>

<p>United States under which such action can be had or conducted on the part of any Judge or person in the County of
       of King for the State of Washington looking to the execution of this petitioner and there is no law of the State of Washington
       or of the United States by which this petitioner should be held longer in restraint or imprisonment by any person whomsover
       pending or waiting, naming or fixing any day for his execution or of any other disposition of this petitioner in anywise whatsover
       and respondent should be restrained and prohibited from longer detaining this peteioner.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>Your petitioner futher informs the Court that he is not guilty of murer or of any other crime; but that notwithstanding certain conviction
       was had of this defendant for the offense of murder previous to the first day of January 1900 from which this petitioner duly complained
       to the State courts for relief; all of which denied him. And respondent the Seriff of King County threatens to execute this petitioner by
       hanging him by the neck until dead August 23, 1901.</p>

<p>That at the time the said judgment against the said defendant was affiremd and became final, the said petitioner was and on the 2nd day
       of Apil A.D. 1900 sentenced to die by being hung by the sheriff of King County, State of Washington; the said hanging to be on the 23
       day of August 1901. That at the time this petitioner was so sentenced and at the time this petitioner was tried for the alleged offense, which
       was the killing of one John Doe Mason and at the time this petitioner was informed against for the said killing and at the time this petitoner
       was informed against for the said killing and at the time the petitoner was tried and at the time the final judgment was rendered against the
       petitioner, the only law authorizing capital punishment and execution in the State of Washington was that certain provision of the laws of the 
       State of Washington and more particularly contained in sections 6993, 6994, and 6995 of the Code known as "Balinger's Code, being a
       certification of the laws of the State of Washignton; which prescribed and only prescribed that the person duly sentenced to death should be
       hung in the County where the said sentence</p>

<pb/>

<p>was passed and the trial had and by the sheriff of the said County wherin the said trial was had and the said sentence was passed.
</p>
<p>That at the time this petitioner was informed against and was tried and was sentenced and judgment became final in the State courts,
       the only law in existence respecting and concerning and relating to the execution of this petitioner, or of any other person, was that 
       herein referred to , which alone vested and invested the sheriff of King County with the right and authority to execute the prisoner or
       the person so condemned and limited and wholly limited the said execution to the venue, jurisdiction and place in the County of trial
       and place of sentence.</p>

<p>VI.</p>

<p>That subsequent to the trial of this petitioner, the conviction of this peteitioner, the return of the verdict and subsequent to the final judgment
       and before execution of the judgment, while the same was pending, the Legislature of the State of Washington did duly repeal all law upon
       the subject of hanging and executions, did wholly repeal then the law existing upon the subject, particularly repealing all law authorizing the
       sheriff of King County, or any sheriff, or any officer which had heretofore been authorized to execute the judgment against this petitioner and did
       repeal and put an end to all law in the State of Washignton authorizing any person whomsover to execute this petitioner adn in the State did enact
       an covering the whole subject matter and as being the only law upon the subject, to-wit, that certain Act of Legislature of the State of Washington,
       approved March 8,1901, as appears on page 100 of the Laws of Washington of 1901, prescribing a new and absoute form of procedure, a new and
       absolute authority in a new and heretofore unnamed person respecting executions and did paticularly provide, which had not heretofore been provided
       nor a part of the law; that, the person condemed to death should be delivered to</p>

<pb/>

<p>the Warden of the Penitentiary; that the said Warden shall take the prisoner so condemned and keep him in solitary confinement until the day appointed in
       the warrant for his execution; and that upon the day so appointed the Warden should, within the walls of the penitentiary execute the prisoner or the person
       so ordered to be executed.</p>

<p>VII.</p>

<p>That the said law repealed all other laws existing upon the subject and that there is no other law or process whatsover other than that neamed in the said Act
       of March 8, 1901. </p>

<p>VIII.</p>

<p>Your petitioner further represents that notwithstanding there is no law for the further detention and holding of him, the said petitioner, and not withstanding as he
       alleges that there is no law justifying or authorizing the form of judgment to be executed against him, either of imprisonment or of execution, the said sheriff of King
       County still holds your petitioner in custody and restraint without authority of the law and against the law.</p>

<p>IX.</p>

<p>That your petitioner under the Constitution is entitled to be held only by due process of law and that as an indictment of the United States, as your petitioner is, he 
       is entitled to be relieved from an unjust and improper restraint and from any law that seeks to hold him contrary to the Constitution for the purpose of execution
       or otherwise.</p>

<p>X.</p>

<p>That the excuse or reason given by the said State of Washignton and the sheriff of King County, particularly for the restraint and holding of the said petitioner is that 
       under the law of the State of Washington heretofore named, to-wit, the Act of Marh 8, 1901, said State of Washington and the said Sheriff has a right to hold said prisoner,
       your petitioner herein, and that under the law it is their purpose to</p>

<pb/>

<p>return the said petitioner to the warden of the State Peitentiary for the purpose of having this petitioner executed, as provided by said law, by the said warden of said
       State Penitentiary. That the said law so far as it concerns this prisoner, your petitioner herein, and so far as it relates to him, is invalid and otherwise ex post facto; that
       is to say, the said law has been passed subsequent to the alleged commission by this petitioner of any crime subsequent to the trial of this petitioner and subsequent to
       the final udgement and subsequent to the judgment which was rendered against him, but before the said final judgment was affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United
       States, and the said law adds burdens to this petitioner which were not to be borne by him, nor a part of the law at the time he was tried, nor a part of the law, which law
       was a part of the procedure under which he was to be tried; nor a part of the law under which any form of judgment against him could be executed, and the said law as to
       him, your petitioner herin, is void as violating the provisions of the Federal Constitution in this, to-wit:</p>

<p>First, in that it does not provide due process against him, and Second, that the same is invalid being ex post facto law as against your petitioner, and your petitioner asserts
       that any attempt to take any steps against him in the way of execution or further imprisonment or restraint under the said law is wholly void, unconstitutional; contrary to the 
       law and against the law; particularly of the Constitution of the United States and of the statutes thereunder.</p>

<p>XI.</p>

<p>That the said law designated as the "Rand" law heretofore referred to and which had previously repealed all laws upon the subject ot which it the said Rand law related, leaving
       no other law upon the subject thatn the said "Rand law".</p>

<pb/>

<p>XII.</p>

<p>The said Rand law thereafter, to-wit, on the 12th day of June 1901 by the legislature of the state of Washington was repealed by the following Repealing Act:</p>

<p>Chapter I.
       Repealing An Act Relative to the Death Warrant.</p>

<p>An Act repealing an act entiled "An Act relating to the death warrant, the contents therof, the return fo the same, and fixing place of execution and amending sections 6993 and 6995
       of Ballinger's Annotated Codes and Statutes of Washington", approved March 8th, 1901, and declaring an emergency.</p>

<p>Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington:
       
       Section 1. The act of the legislature of the State of Washington entitled "An Act relating to the death warrant, the contents thereof, the return of same, and fixing place of execution, and

       Sec. 2. For the purpose of preventing the act hereby repealed from ever becoming operative for any purpose an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act shall take effect immediately.
