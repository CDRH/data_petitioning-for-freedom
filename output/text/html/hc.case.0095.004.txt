of Leo Sun before the Hon. C. H. Hanford at the Court house in the city of Seattle
on June 8th 1889 at the hour of one o'clock P.M. together with the time and cause
of imprisonment and detention, I give the cause and time of said imprisonment as follows,
towit: said Leo Sun was arrested in Ellensburgh on the 14 day of May 1889 on the charge
of smuggling opium, and was taken before U.S. Commissioner S. C. Davidson who held
him to answer appear and answer the charge against him at the October Term of the
North Yakima District Court, fixing the amount of Bail at $300 which he failed to
give, and was then committed to the custody of the U.S. Marshal. He was then committed
to the Kettitas Co. Jail until the 29th of May when I brought him to Seattle and committed
him to the King Co. Jail on the the way to the U.S. Penitentiary to be held for tiral
at the Oct. Term of District Court for North Yakima for the crime of smuggling. In
