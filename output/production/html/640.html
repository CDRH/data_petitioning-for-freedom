    <li>Summary of Proceedings: James Stephenson filed a complaint that charged Ben Shear of the offense of infamous crime against nature with a beast. Stevenson alleged that he had &#x201C;certain carnal and venereal intercourse&#x201D; with a mare. After the preliminary examination, Shear said that there was no charge or offense against the laws of Nebraska against him. He also said there was no evidence against him that showed that there was probably cause to believe he had committed any offense. Bail was set for Shear at fifteen hundred dollars. The last information in the files say that the hearing was continued and the outcome of Shear&#x2019;s petition is unknown. </li>
