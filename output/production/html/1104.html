    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On March 13th, 1922 Oliver Watson was arrested for reckless driving. On March 14th, a complaint in writing was drawn by John T. Marcell charging Oliver with reckless driving contrary to the statutes of the state of Nebraska. Oliver was tried and was sentenced by the court to pay a fine of $100 and the costs of prosecution. Police Magistrate Charles Foster issued a mittimus to detain Oliver until fines and costs were paid. The same day, Oliver petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that he was being unlawfully detained and fined because the complaint against him was void because no such reckless driving statute existed in Nebraska. He named Michael Clark, sheriff, as the respondent. Frank M Dineen responded on behalf of the state, citing that Michael Clark was lawfully detaining Oliver due to the mittimus issued by Charles Foster. The petition was granted and writ eventually allowed. Charles Leslie, the judge who oversaw the habeas proceedings, agreed that there was no reckless driving crime in the Nebraska statutes. Oliver Watson was released from custody.</li>
