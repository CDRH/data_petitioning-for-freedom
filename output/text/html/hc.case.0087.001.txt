To the Hon Richard A Jones Chief Justice of the Territory of Washington and Judge
of the Third Judicial District sitting for the trial of cause under the Laws of the
United States.

The above named plaitiffs by Ah Quong on their behalf and on behalf of each of the
said plaitiffs show unto your Honor:

II That each of the said plaintiffs to wit: Wong Sam, Foke Gee, Ah Moke Chin Sam Ah
Zee and Wong Hing are each unlawfully imprisoned detained confined and restrained
of his liberty by E.V. Rugar 


board the "Steamer Premier" which said steamer is now moored and lying at the wharves
in the City of Seattle in said King County, and that said E.V. Rugar has so detained
the said plaintiffs on said steamer for the period of about one day

II II That the cause or pretense of said imprisonment according to the best of the
knowledge and belief of this applicant is the arbitrary will of the said Rugar and
without any just or lawful cause or excuse.

II II II That the said above named plaintiffs are Chinese persons and are each entitled
under the laws of the United States to be and remain in the United States, but that
said Rugar refuses to allow the said plaintiffs to leave said steamer and go whether
they please as they each by law are entitled to do.

II V That the said imprisonment and restrain of each of said plaintiffs by the said
E.V. Rugar on board the said Steamer Premier is illegal and that the illegality thereof
consists


in this: That each of the said plaintiffs heretofore are lawful residents of the United
States, and departed from the Home and to wit about June 1884, and each received from
the Collector of Customs at Port Townsend in said Territory, upon said departure a
due and lawful certificate as provided by law, entitling each of said plaintiffs to
reenter the United States upon producing and delivering such certificate to the collector
of customes in the district

V That each of said plaintiffs have produced and  delivered up such certificate to
the said collector of customs of this district but that the said E.V. Rugar acting
as Deputy Collector refuses to allow the said plaintiffs or either of them to depart
from said "Steamer Premier" and now holds them imprisoned thereon and now threatens
to and is about to transport each of said plaintiffs beyond the jurisdiction of this
court and out of the United States

VI That said plaintiffs are not held


and imprisoned for any other or different cause or pretense than under the facts and
circumstances above stated

Wherefore your petitioner on behalf of each of said plaintiffs prays that a writ of
Habeas Corpus may be granted directed to the said E.V. Rugar commanding him to have
the bodies of each of the said Wong Sam Ah Moke Foke Gee Chin Sam Ah Zee and Wong
Hing before your Honor at a time and place therein to be specified to do and receive
what shall then and there be ordered concerning him or each or either of said plaintiffs
respectively and to have then and there the said writ and the said return certificates
herein mentioned and make due return as to the time and cause of the detention of
said plaintiffs respectfully and that each of said plaintiffs be restored to his liberty
