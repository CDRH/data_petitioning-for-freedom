    <li>Summary of Proceedings: It was November 25th, 1942, when Gus A. Fagerberg petitioned for and was allowed an order for writ of Habeas Corpus having been arrested and deprived of his liberty by Dennis H. Cronin and William C. Condit in July of that year. Fagerberg was arrested on the grounds of violating the National Prohibition Act and then sentenced to three months imprisonment on five counts and a fine of $500. In his petition he presented that he had satisfied the longest period of imposed imprisonment and yet was still being held in custody. Later in the same month the court agreed, and he was discharged. It was March of 1925 when an appeal was made and then granted to Cronin and Condit after they presented that the ordered imprisonment of three months on the five counts were to run consecutively and that the imprisonment was justified until the fine was paid, of which Fagerberg had not paid. It was February of the following year that the Circuit Court of Appeals filed a mandate that the decision to discharge Fagerberg be reversed and that he be remanded to custody in compliance with the case Cronin, U.S. Marshal et al., vs William J. Fox. Later that same month the writ of Habeas Corpus was discharged and Fagerberg remanded to custody. </li>
