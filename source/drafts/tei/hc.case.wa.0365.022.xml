<p>Incl. 6219
No. 5490/149</p>

<p>To FREDERICK, A. WALLIS, Commissioner of Immigration, Ellis Island. N.Y.H.</p>

<p>WHEREAS, from proofs submitted to me, after due hearing before Immigrant
Inspector Thos. M. Fisher, held at McNeil Island, Wash.,</p>

<p>I have become satisfied that the alien
Jack Matthews, or John Matthews, alias
Yan Matsyeff,</p>

<p>who landed at the port of an unknown port,
on the 31st day of August, 1919, has been found in the United States
in violation of the Immigrant act of February 5, 1917, to wit:

That he has been sentenced, subsequent to the passage of said Act, to
imprisonment for a term of one year or more because of conviction in this country
of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after his entry
into the United States; and that he was a person likely to become a public charge
at the time of his entry,

and may be deported in accordance therewith:

I Louis F. Post, Assistant Secretary of Labor, by virtue of the power
and authority vested in me by the laws of the United States, I hereby command
to return the said alien to Ukrainia to the country whence he came, at the
expense of the appropriation "Expenses of Regulating Immigration, 1921." You are
directed to purchase transportation for the alien from New York, N.Y., to his home
in Ukrainia at the lowest available rate, payable from the above-named appropriation.

For so doing, this shall be your sufficient warrant.
Witness my hand and seal this 19th day of February, 1921.</p>

<p>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION
WASHINGTON</p>

<p>IN ANSWERING REFER TO
NO. 54901/149</p>

<p>February 19, 1921.</p>

<p>Commissioner of Immigration,
Seattle, Wash.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>The Bureau acknowledges the receipt of your letter of the 5th
instant, No. 37012/500, transmitting record of hearing accorded the alien
JACK MATTHEWS, or JOHN MATTHEWS, alias
YAN HATVEYEFF,
who entered at an unknown port,
on August 31, 1919.</p>

<p>After a careful examination of the evidence submitted in this
case, the Department is of opinion that the alien is in the United
States in violation of law. You are therefore directed to cause him
to be taken into custody and conveyed to New York, N.Y. for deportation,
the expenses incident to such conveyance, including the employment
of an attendant to assist in delivery, if necessary, at a nominal
compensation of $1.00 and expenses in both ways, being authorized, payable from
the appropriation "Expenses of Regulating Immigration 1921"
Conveyance of the alien of New York, N.Y., <add>in connection with a party</add> should be deferred
until definite arrangements have been made by the Ellis Island officer for
his return and sailing dates furnished you by that office.
Defer deportation pending his release from prison.</p>

<p>Respectfully
Alfred Hampton
Assistant Commissioner General.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>February 11, 1921.</p>

<p>In re YAN MATVEYEFF. NO. 54904/149.
Deportation is hereby directed for the charges in the
warrant of arrest.</p>

<p>WARRANT-IMMIGRATION</p>

<p>No.54904/149        February 10, 1920.</p>

<p>Pursuant to Departmental instructions the Bureau transmits herewith the
case of YAN MATVEYEFF, alias JOHN or JACK MATTHEWS.</p>

<p>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

DISTRICT NO.16</p>

<p>IN REPLYING REFER TO
NO. 37012/600.</p>

<p>DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS
U.S. COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRANT
SEATTLE, WASH.</p>

<p>February 5th, 1921.</p>

<p>Commissioner-General of Immigration,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Referring to Bureau file No.54904/149, the case of
YAN MATVEYEFF, alias JOHN (or JACK) MATTHEWS, for whose
arrest the Assistant Secretary issued his warrant under
date of November 15th, 1920, I transmit herewith the
record of the hearing accorded the alien, who is now
serving a sentence of one year in the United States
Penitentiary, McNeil Island, Washington, for the crime
of sending obscene matter through the mails. His
sentence will expire, commitation considered, on
April 4th, 1921.</p>

<p>The alien has not been represented by an Attorney.</p>

<p>Attention is requested to the summary and recommendation
of the examining inspector, who recommends that the
alien be ordered deported. I concur in this recommendation.</p>

<p>The alien's last entry was from Canada, but as he
never became a citizen of that country and as he does
not come wihtin the terms of the present reciprocal
agreement between this Service and the Dominion Immigration
Service, his return to Canada cannot be accomplished
and I therefore recommend that the alien be ordered
deported to Ukrauinia, the country of which he is now
apparently a citizen.</p>

<p>John H. Sargent
Acting Commissioner</p>
