<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, IN AND FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, SOUTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>Ex Parte In the Matter of Leroy Smith for Writ of Habeas Corpus. POINTS AND AUTHORITIES. 3445</p>

<p><unclear>STATMENT.</unclear></p>

<p>The petitioner in this action was indicted on the 8th day of May, 1916, in the United States District Court of Arizona, a certified copy of said indictment being attached to the original petition. To said indictment and the facts therein contained the defendant did on the 15th day of may, 1916, enter a plea of guilty, and upon his said plea of guilty he was sentenced to the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington, for theperiod of one year and one day.</p>

<p>The question raised by a recital of the facts contianed in the petition is whether or not the District Court, in view of the procedings, acquired jurisdiction of the defendant and the subject matter, or the authority under said indictment to render its judgment. "There are three essential elements necessary to render convictions valid. These are that the court must have jurisdiction over the subject matter, the person of the defendant, and authority to render the particular judgment. If any one of these elements is lacking the judgment is fatally defective and the person held under such judgment may be released on habeas corpus." Ex Parte Webb, 51 Pac. 1027.</p>

<p>It is submitted that if the constitutional perogatives</p>

<pb/>

<p>guaranteed to your petitioner under the due process and due conviction clause of the United States Constitution are to be observed, your petitioner submits that the District Court never acquired jurisdiction to render judgment or pronounce sentence against your petitioner for the reason that the indictment is fatally defective in this, that it charges neither a crime nor an offence known to law and is therefore void abintio, and the defendant's plea of guilty thereto is but an admission of the facts charged in the indictment.</p>

<p>On the 5th day of June, 1916, the Supreme Court of the United States, Mr. Justice Hughes and Mr. Justice Pitney dissenting, in the case of U.S. vs. Jin Fuey Moy, held that persons named in Section 8 of the act must be taken to refer only to the class of persons who are required to register by these articles in his possession with no intention of vending. "When a person is held without any lawful authority and by order beyond the jurisdiction of an inferior federal court, the supreme court will, in favor of liberty, grant the writ, not to review the whole case, but to examine the authority of the court below to ACT AT ALL. Habeas corpus lies whenever the court is without constitutional authority to convict." Re Bonner, 151 U.S. 256.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice La Mar, in Henry vs. Henkle, 235 U.S., 219, at page 228 said: "In view, however, of the nature of the writ and of the character of the detention under a warrant, no hard and fast rule has been announced as to how far the courts will go in passing upon question raised in habeas corpus proceedings."</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Bradley, in Ex Parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, at page 376, said: "An unconstitutional law is void as is no law. An offence created by it is not a crime, a</p>

<pb/>

<p>conviction under it is not merely erroneous but is illegal and void and cannot be a legal ause of imprisonment. It is true, if no writ of error lies the judgment may be final in the sense that there may be no means of reversing it, but personal liberty is of so great moment in the eye of the law that the judgment of an inferior court affecting it is not deemed so conclusive but that as we have seen the question of the court's authority to try and imrpison a party may be reviewed on habeas corpus by a superior court or judge having authority to award the writ. We are satisfied that the present is one of the cases in which this court is authorized to take such jurisdiction. We think so because if the laws are unconstitutional and void the circuit court acquired no jurisdiction of the causes, its authority to indict and try the petitioner arose solely upon these laws."</p>

<p>The Honorable Court in Mackey vs. Miller, 126 Fed. 160, through Circuit Judge Gilbert, on page 163, said: "Question is made of the power of this court upon habeas corpus to discharge the appellants upon the facts set forth in the record, and it is said that the writ of habeas corpus cannot be used to perform the function of a writ of error, but the doctrine is well established that upon a writ of habeas corpus, if it appear that the court that rendered the judgment had no jurisdiction to render it either because the proceedings under which they were taken were unconsitutional, or for any other reason, the judgment is void and may be questioned collaterally, and the person who is imprisoned thereunder may be discharged from custody on a habes corpus." Ex parte Nielsen, 131 U.S. 271
Ex parte Lange, 18th Wall. 163
Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371.
"If it be true that the acts committed by the appellants which are set forth in the indictment in this case are not within the intendment of Section 5447 Revised Statutes, they do not constitute an offence against the statute or against any other statute of the United States. Such being the case, it appears affirmatively from the return that the appellants are held in custody under a judgment which upon its face is void." Ex parte McNulty, 11Am. St. Rep. 260

People ex rel Tweed v. Liscomb, 60 N.Y.Rep.593.</p>

<p>No statute being violated (U.S. vs. Jin Fuey Moy, supra) the judgment rendered has no charge upon which to be predicated, and is void.</p>

<p>In Ex parte Farrell, the Supreme Court of Montana, (92 Pac. 785), said:
(1) "Where an information states facts which do not constitute the offense attempted to be charged, and no addition to them can supply what is essential, the court is without jurisdiction, the judgment is void, and imprisonment under execution thereon is illegal."
(2) "Where an information states no offense, and cannot be remedied by amendment, the court is without jurisdiction, and accused is entitled to release on habeas corpus, even though he might secure the same relief on appeal."
The court further said at page 786: "It will be observed the the writings referred to have not impressed upon them the seal of the court, and upon this fact the complainant bases the contention, made in this court, that they are void, and hence do not support a charge of forgery. If this contention can be maintained, the complainant is entitled to his release; for, as was said in Ex parte Kearny, 55 Cal. 212, at page 228: "This is not the case of a coplaint inartificially drawn, which intimates the existence of the facts necessary to the constitution of the offense, or even of an attempted statement, insufficient, but indicating a purpose to declare on the essential facts. It is a total failure to allege any cause of action, and however objectionable the conduct imputed to the petitioner, he is no more, in the eye of the law, charged by the complaint with any crime than if the paper had ascribed to him the most innocent of deeds." If it were a case of a defective information only, it might well be contended, as the Attorney General contends here, that the district court had jurisdiction, and that this court should require the complainant to seek relief through the medium of his appeals. But if an information states facts which do not constitute the offense, and no addition to them, however full and complete can supply what is essential, then the court is without jurisdiction to put the complainant on trial. In such case the judgment cannot be</p>

<pb/>

<p>corrected. It is simply void. Imprisonment under execution thereon is illegal, and the complainant is entitled to his release, even though he might secure the same relief on appeal. State v. District Court, 35 Mont. 321, 89 Pac. 63."
"Whether the court pronounced a proper judgment may be inquired into by habeas corpus, though the complainant has remedy by appeal, for if the judgment is void an appeal need not be taken."
Ex parte McDonald, 146 Pac. 942.
"Habeas corpus lies to secure the release of one in custody under a conviction upon a complaint which charges no ofense under the laws of the state, because no law existed making the acts committed by the accused an offense although he did not pursue his remedy by appeal."
Ex parte Roquermore, 32 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1186.</p>

<p>Plea of Guilty</p>

<p>The petitioner having raised no objection either to the suficiency of the indictment or to the jurisdiction of the court, and having entered a plea of guilty, can he now question either?
"The effect of the plea of guilty, generally speaking, is a record admission of whatever is well charged in an indictment, but if the latter be insufficient either from a standpoint of failing to confer jurisdiction or to set forth facts sufficient to constitute a public offense, theplea of guilty confesses nothing."
Bishop's New Criminal Procedure, Vol. 1, 795.
"In cases of this kind the indictment is abasis of the court's jurisdiction to either pass judgment or impose punishment, and a plea of guilty does not cure jurisdictional defects in an indictment. A plea of guilty amounts to nothing more than an acknowledgment of the facts charged in the indictment. But whether such facts constitute an offense at law is left open to be decided by the court."
Crow vs. State, 6 Texas 334.</p>

<pb/>

<p>In the case of State vs. Levy, et al, 119 Mo. 436, 24 S.W. 1026, the attorney for the people admitted that the indictment in the case was bad, but contended that the defendants having plead guilty, waived any exception to the validity of invalidity of the court, the judgment and all other proceedings were regular and the defendants had no right to complain or be heard to complain of the judgment rendered at either instance. The court said:
"The effect of such a plea only amounts to an admission by record of the truth of whatever is suficiently alleged in the indictment and no conession, however large and explicit, will prevent a defendant from taking advantage of faults apparent of record. If no crime is charged in the indictment, then none is confesed by pleading guilty thereto."</p>

<p>In the case of Fletcher, et al, vs. State, 12 Ark. 169, it was the contention of the Attorney General that insomuch as the defendants pleaded guilty in th circuit court below they thereby waived all defects in the indictment. The supreme court in passing upon the case said:
"The law has been long settled otherwise; no confession however large and explicit can have any such effect. The defendantshere but confessed themselves guilty in manner and form as charged agianst them in the indictment; and if no offense against the law is charged they have not confessed themselves guilty of any, but if the confession was still broader and embraced a crime, when the indictment fell short of it, and punishment followed, it would be the punishment of a crime not proceeed for by indictment."
"While a plea of guilty is a record admission of whatever is well charged in the indictment, yet if the indictment is insufficient either from the standpoint of failing to confer jurisdiction or to allege facts sufficient to constitute a public offense, the plea of guilty confesses nothing."
"A plea of guilty does not cure jurisdictional defects in an indictment."
Ex parte Dickson, 133 Pac. 393 (Nev.)</p>

<pb/>

<p>In this matter the petitioner was charged by indictment with grand larceny and pleaded guilty to petit larceny. The court said:
"Where petitioner, having pleaded guilty to petit larceny, under an indictment charging grand larceny found under a statute which did not embrace petit larceny as an included offense, was sentenced to imprisonment, the fact that he did not except to the court's jurisdiction or raise, by demurrer or otherwise, defects in the indictment, and that he voluntarily pleaded guilty to petit larceny, did not preclude him from interposing an objection to the court's jurisdiction to sentence him for that offense by haveas corpus at any time during his imprisonment."</p>

<p>We respectfully submit to this Honorable Court that the petitioner in this action was not charged with any crime, and that he pleaded guilty to no crime, and that he is now held in the United States penitentiary in violation of law and his constitutional rights. We therefore pray that this Honorable Court issue the writ prayed for and that your petitioner be restored to his liberty.</p>
