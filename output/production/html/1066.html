    <li>Summary of Proceedings: H. Ray Desch petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve his daughter, Margaret Desch, from Katherine Krummack, which was granted. Katherine was the girl's grandmother, being the mother of Ray Desch's late wife. Ray had left the girl with her after his wife's death in January 1917, as he had no home at the time, but managed to pay Mrs. Krummack $10 a month to take care of the girl and bought all of his daughter's clothes. After Ray got back on his feet and remarried, he asked his mother-in-law for custody of Margaret. After hearing the evidence, Margaret was remanded into the custody of her father, with the stipulation that Krummack could see her granddaughter whenever she wanted. Margaret apparently protested against the decision, as she had grown quite attached to her grandmother while living with her. </li>
