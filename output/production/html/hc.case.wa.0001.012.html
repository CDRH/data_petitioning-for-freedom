      <p class="tei_p">Mutilation of left ear would probably have been made at time cut was made - did not observe wound on right side of neck blood had settled but no abrassion of the skin by witness was wound on left head first fingers broken - no external marks of violence (scalp around) on right side thick blows might be <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> if broken and comminution produce and skull was <del/> no evidence of scalp wound</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Re Direct
 I do not think <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> could be produced by one blow on left side on right side it might have been produced by one single blow of large <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">round[?]</span> club</p>

      <p class="tei_p">average thickness human skull ranges from and for 1/8 to 1/2 inch  3/8 inch would be the average thickness according to locality - thickness of skull does vary in <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">men[?]</span>
