      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable George Jacobs Judge of said Court:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The petition of the Ah Ham &amp; Ah Gorg <del> an </del> inhabitants and residents of Seattle in said District respectfully represents, that Ah Sing and Ah Yoel are unlawfully restrained of their liberty in the County Jail of King County aforeseaid.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The cause or pretense of said restraint is that they, the said prisoners are charged with owing 14.50 taxes to the city of Seattle.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioners alleges the said imprisonment to be illegal because no such tax has ever been assessed against said prisoners and because the City Marshall, by whom they were imprisoned had no warrant or legal authority to collect such tax:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Wherefore your petitioners pray<del>s</del> that a writ of Habeas Corpus issue and that such prisoners be brought up and discharged.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Ah Ham</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Ah Gong his mark</p>
