<p>In the District Court, holding terms at Seattle in King County, Washington Territory.</p>

<p>In the matter of the application of Yu Gum and Yu Hung for a Writ of Habeas Corpus: No</p>

<p>TERRITORY OF WASHINGTON )</p>
<p>County of King) ss</p>

<p>To the Honorable Roger S. Greene, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Washington Territory and Judge of the above entitiled Court:</p>

<p>Your petitioners, Yu Gum and Yu Hung (Chinawomen) respectfully shows to your Honor.</p>

<p>I. That they and each of them are unlawfully imprisoned, detained, confined and restrained of their liberty by one Charles Henry, Deputy U.S. Marshal of Washington Territory, in the King County jail, at Seattle, King County, Washington Territory.</p>

<p>II. That the cause or pretense of said restraint, according to the best of the knowledge and belief of your petitioners, is as follows, to wit: Your petitioners were charged, before Hon Eben Smith, U.S. Commissioner, by one W.C. Ronald, of being unlawfully within the United States, contrary to the provisions of an Act of the Congress of the United States, commonly known as the Restriction Act, and upon a hearing before said U.S. Commissioner he, the said Commissioner, decided that your petitioners were unlawfully within the United States, and that they had come
<pb/>

thereto from the Province of British Columbia, and ordered that your petitioners be taken back to said British Columbia, and committed your petitioners to the Custody of said Charles Henry, to be deported, and your petitioners are now confined and restrained of their liberty, by the said Charles Henry, as aforesaid.</p>

<p>III. That said restraint of your petitioners is illegal and the illegality thereof consists in this to wit: That on the hearing before said Commisioner, no evidence was adduced showing or tending to show that your petitioners, or either of them, are unlawfully within in the United States, the only evidence adduced before said Commissioner being, as follows: that your petitioners are females; that they came from Port Ludlow, Washington Territory to Seattle, Washington Territory in male attire; and that your petitioners had told Chinese interpreter that they came to said Port Ludlow from the City of San Francisco, in the State of California in the United States, direct, without making any stop at any place, save at the City of Port Townsend</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding that the above was the only testimony addiced before said Commissioner, he decided that your petitioners should be deported to British Columbia.</p>

<p>And your petitioners allege that they are not unlawfully within the United States, but that they have resided therein for a long period of time, to wit: since the year 1876, and that they have not been out of the United States since said date; that your petitioners are young girls of the age of 10
<pb/>

 and 11 years respectively; that their relatives and friends reside in the United States and your petitioners will be forever <choice><sic>seprated</sic><corr>separated</corr></choice> from them, if deported to British Columbia.</p>

<p>Wherefore, your petitioners pray that a Writ of Habeas Corpus may be granted, directed to said Charles Henry, Deputy U.S. Marshal of Washington Territory, commanding him to have the bodies of your petitioners before Your Honor, at a time and place therein to be names, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered by your Honor, at a time and place therein to be named, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered by your Honor concerning them, together with the time and cause of <del></del> their detention, and said writ; that your Honor will then investigate the charge against your petitioners, and restore them to liberty</p>
