    <li>Summary of Proceedings: George Taylor said that Raymond Taylor, his five year old son, was taken from his house in April by his ex-wife and Raymond&#x2019;s mother, Gertie Taylor. Gertie had sued him for divorce in September of 1903, accusing him of "cruel and inhuman treatment," such as when he threatened to shoot her. George alleged that Gertie took him while he was away at work and that she refused to let him talk to or see their child. However, George had already kidnapped the child once, according to the Omaha Daily Bee. He also alleged that Gertie told several people that this was her plan and that she even told George the afternoon when it happened that she was going to leave immediately with their child for Colorado. While the case was in session, Raymond Taylor was given to Mrs. Grace Ingram to care for. On May 29, 1903, there was an order issued, giving the custody of Raymond to Gertie Taylor and George was allowed to visit. Then on June 1, there was a motion for a new trial where the fate of Raymond Taylor is unknown. However, on July 11, 1903, George was accused with kidnapping his son, as he claimed that Gertie was not properly taking care of the boy.</li>
