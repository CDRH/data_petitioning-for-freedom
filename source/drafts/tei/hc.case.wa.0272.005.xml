<p>No. 1390</p>
    
<p>In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington</p>
    
<p>In the Matter of the Application of Columbia George for a Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>
    
<p>Motion and Affidavit</p>

<p>Filed in the U.S. Circuit Court, Western Dist. of Washington. FEB 24 1906. A. Reeves Ayres, Clerk</p>
    
<pb/>

<p>In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington</p>
    
<p>In the matter of the application of Columbia George for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. Motion</p>
    
<p>Based upon the affidavit of R J Slater filled herewith the above named Petitioner moves this
   honorable court permitting him to prosecute this proceeding as a poor person without the payment of costs.</p>
    
<p>R.J. Slater, Attorney for Petitioner</p>
    
<pb/>
    
<p>In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington</p>
    
<p>In the matter of the application of Columbia George for a Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>
    
<p>State of Washington, County of King</p>
    
<p>I, R J Slater, being first duly sworn, say: That I am attorney for the above named Petitioner; that I am personally acquainted
   with him, and am personally acquainted with his financial circumstances; that he is an allottee on Umatilla Reservation in the
   State of Oregon, of One Hundred Sixty (160) acres of land, but since he has been confined to the Penitentiary the Untied States
   authorities have refused to allow him to transact any business concerning the same, and he has received no benefits therefrom,
   and he is absolutely impecunious and has no money nor property of any kind and no means whereby he can produce any funds; that I
   am acting as his attorney without any compensation excepting what I may be able to hereafter obtain should he be set at liberty and
   restored to his rights upon said Umatila Indian Reservation; that there is no one connected with this case or interested in the said
   Petitioner who has any funds or property, for which reason I make this affidivit and ask the Court for an order that this matter may
   be prosecuted without the payment of costs.</p>
    
<p>R.J. Slater</p>
    
<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 24th day of February, 1906</p>
    
<p>James J. McCafferty, Notary Public in and for said County and State residing at Seattle, said County</p>
