<p>COMPLAINT IN EXTRADITION.</p>
<p>THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION.)() ss.</p> 
<p>JOHN K. KENNEDY, being first duly sworn, upon oath
deposes and says: That he is a barrister at law and Crown
Prosecutor for the city of Vancouver, in the Province of
British Columbia, Dominion of Canada, and makes this com-
plaint for and on behalf of the Province of British Columbia 
for the purpose of the procuring the extradition and return of
one LEWIS JOHNSON, who is a fugitive from justice from the
said city of Vancouver and Province of British Columbia.</p> 
<p>Affiant further deposes that as such Crown Prosecu-
tor and barrister at law, aforesaid, he is authorized to
represent the said Dominion of Canada in proceedings for
extradition of criminals; and thereupon your affiant says
that heretofore, to-wit, on the Fourth day of June, One
Thousand Nine Hundred and Fifteen, at the city of Vancouver
in the Province of British Columbia, Dominion of Canada, in
the Empire of Great Britain, one Lewis Johnson did then and
there with force and arms wilfully, knowingly, unlawfully
and feloniously steal, take and carry away eighteen hundred
and eighty dollars ($1880.00), lawful money of the Dominion
of Canada, a more particular description of said money being
to affiant unknown; the said money then and there being the
property of one John Prichard, that is to say, that the said
Lewis Johnson did, on the 4th day of June, 1915, at Vancouver
aforesaid steal the said money from the said Lewis Prichard
while the said Lewis Prichard was drunk and intoxicated in a
saloon or hotel in said city of Vancouver, between the hours
of 7 P.M. on the 4th day of June, 1915, and 2 A.M. on the
5th day of June, 1915.</p> 
<pb></pb> 
<p>This complaint is made upon the information and
belief of affiant, who personally examined the witnesses,
John Prichard, William Cruikshank, Robert Tate, Frankie 
Russell, Detectives McLachlin, and <unclear>Andy</unclear>Garnett, who have made
deposition under oath to the said larceny as herein set out, 
and whose depositions, duly authenticated, will be presented 
to the United States Commissioner at the hearing upon this

<p>Affiant further deposes that the above and foregoing
facts constitute a larceny unde the laws of the Dominion
of Canada, and as such are within the terms and provisions
of the extradition treaties between Great Britain and the
United States; and the said Lewis Johnson fled from Vancouver
aforesaid on or about June 7th 1915 and is now a fugitive from
justice in the state of Washington within the 22nd division and district.</p>

<p>Exhibit "B"</p> 
<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION</p>
<p>BEFORE JOHN C. WHITLOCK, UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application
of the Government of the Dominion 
of Canada for the Extradition of 
LEWIS JOHNSON</p>
<p>CERTIFICATE OF UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER
Finding Probable Cause for Extradition, together with
Certified Copy of all the Evidence in said proceeding.</p>
<p>To The Honorable Secretary of State
For the United States,
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Sir:-</p> 
<p>I have the honor to submit to you for your consid-
eration my certificate of probable cause, with a finding that
the defendant, Lewis Johnson, should be extradicted and re-
turned to Canada, in compliance with the request of the Gov-
ernor of British Columbia, upon the grounds stated in the
complaint, a certified copy of which is hereto, to-
gether with a copy of all the evidence in said cause.</p> 
<p>Complaint was made and filed by John K. Kennedy, 
Barrester at Law and Crown Prosecutor for the City of Van-
couver, and representative for the Attorney General of the
Province of British Columbia, alleging that Lewis Johnson</p>
<pb></pb> 
<p>did steal, take and carry away the sum of Eighteen Hundred
and Eighty ($1880.) Dollars, lawful money of the Dominion
of Canada, at the City of Vancouver, on the 4th day of June,
1915, the said $1880. then and there being the property of
one John Prichard; the complaint furthor alleged that Lewis
Johnson was within the Northern Division of the Western Dis-
trict of Wasshington, and a fugitive from justice from the
City of Vancouver, he having fled from said city on or about
the 6th day of June, 1915. This complaint was duly sworn to 
before me as United States Commissioner and a warrant for
the arrest and apprehension of the said Lewis Johnson there-
upon issued.</p> 
<p>Thereupon the said Lewis Johnson was brought be-
fore me upon said process for hearing upon the complaint, 
which was held on June 22nd and again on June 26th. At
this hearing the Government of the Dominion of Canada was
represented by the Honorable John K. Kennedy, above re--
ferred to, and William McRea, Deputy Chief Constable for
the City of Vancouver. Depositions, duly authenticated, 
of witnesses who testified to the facts concerning this
larceny before the Police Magistrate in the City of Van-
couver, were introduced in evidence at this hearing by
Mr. Kennedy on behalf of the Dominion of Canada.</p>
<p>From the oral testimony of Mr. Kennedy and from
the depositions, it appears that there is reasonable ground
to believe that the defendant, Lewis Johnson, committed
larceny in violation of Section 347 of the Criminal Code
of the Dominion of Canada, and that this offense as de-
fined by said section and as shown by the evidence in this</p> 
<pb></pb> 
<p>cause come within the purview of the Treaty Provisions
between Great Britian and the United States, and as such
constitutes an extraditable offence for which the de-
fendant, Lewis Johnson, should be extradited and removed
to Canada for trial thereon.</p> 
<p>I further certify and find that the Lewis John-
son named in the British Columbia proceeding, is the Lewis
Johnson who was brought before me upon this process.</p> 
<p>I further certify that the attached depositions, 
together with a transcript of the evidence, and copies of
warrant and mittimus, are the original documents and true
copies of all of the papers and documents in said cause
before me in this proceeding, and that all of the evidence 
in said cause before me is contained therein.</p> 
<p>Respectfully submitted under my hand and seal 
this 30th day of June, A.D. 1915.</p> 
<p>United States Commisioner 
for the Western District of
Washington, at Seattle.</p>
