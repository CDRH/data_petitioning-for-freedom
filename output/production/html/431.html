    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Pete Johnson was taken into custody on 8 November 1913 by Chief of Police John Briggs and County Jailer Michael Corcoran. He was charged with &#x201C;playing at a gambling game for money in a public place.&#x201D; He was released on a bail bond and his trial was set for 12 November 1913. On 10 November 1913, Briggs filed a complaint against Johnson charging him with the same offense, contrary to the forms and ordinances in such case in the State of Nebraska. On 12 November 1913, Johnson appeared in court before Police Judge James F. Callahan. He was found guilty of the aforementioned offense, contrary to the ordinances of the city. He was sentenced to a fine of $100 and costs or 90 days in county jail. The charge of gambling for money in a public place is not a misdemeanor under the ordinances of South Omaha, NE and that it is not a crime of any kind, degree, or nature. Thus, he was not arraigned according to law. On 12 November 1913, an order allowing the writ of habeas corpus was filed. The writ was returned on 13 November 1913. </li>
