<p>That said defendant by his failure to make provision for his family, and his utter inattention to the in necessities and wants has made it impossible <del/> for the complainant to live and cohabit with the defendant.

Martin one of the said minor children, complainant avers that the defendant is not a fit  or competent person to have the care, custody and control of said minor child. She therefore prays that a writ of Habeas Corpus may issue directed to the said Jesse Martin Jr the defendant, commanding him to produce before your Honor the said Minor child, forthwith, or at such time as given Now may direct Either at Chambers or at the Ensuing term of the U States Dist Court to be held in Olympia, that the right to the care &amp; custody of the said minor child, as well as the care and custody of the minor child now in possession of the complainant may be determined And as Serious apprehensions are entertained that the defendant may remove the minor child in his possession as well as the one which she now has beyond the Jurisdiction of
