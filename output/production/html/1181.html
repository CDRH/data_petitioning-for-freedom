    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On March 24th, 1921, Robert Swinney petitioned for and received an order allowing a writ of habeas corpus having been held in unlawful detainment under Marshal Eberstein and Charles Van Duesen following a request from George Robb. All of whom held Swinney by virtue of a warrant from the governor of Nebraska to have Swinney transported to Iowa to be charged with wife desertion. In his petition, Swinney presented that the issued warrant was void as he had been residing in Nebraska since 1919 and had been a citizen for two years. It was argued that there was a failure and want for evidence that would establish the connection of Swinney to the alleged crime. Later that same month the court ordered the writ be granted and Swinney was discharged from custody.</li>
