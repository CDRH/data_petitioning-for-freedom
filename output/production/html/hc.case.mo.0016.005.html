      <p class="tei_p">To the Hon J C Moody</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your respondent upon to have your writ of Habeas Corpus has been served to have the body of Missouri Bird an infant before you asks leave to state that said child has been living with respondent for some five weeks that on last week, friday one Lizzie Bird took said child away from respondents House &amp; kept her most of the day, when the child returned to respondents house &amp; has remained ever since that respondent does not detain said child or use any restraint towards her whatever that she stays of her own choice &amp; is free to go when ever she pleases</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Respondent states that she has furnished said child with clothing &amp; has taken good care of her since the child has been with her, that the child wants very much to remain with respondent &amp; that respondent is willing to keep the child</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That said child is now here before your honor Respondent would further respectfully state that the said Lizzy Bird has mistreated &amp; abused said child that the child does not want to go to her &amp; in fact is much alarmed at the idea of having to do so and Respondent finally states that she feels certain that said Lizzy Bird is not a fit or suitable person to have the care &amp; custody of said child</p>
