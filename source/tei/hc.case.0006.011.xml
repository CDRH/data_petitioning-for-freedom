otherwise disregarded his said covenant 
or any or either of them; denies that he

was used in her presence or hearing, and 
denies that he has caused her or is now 
causing her or that he has allowed her 
to associate with the vile or with
women of ill fame or other improper 
persons whomsoever</p>

<p>Defendant further shows to the Honorable 
Court that some several months before 
the execution of said agreement the said 
Josephine Sheffler voluntarily let said 
Defendant have said child and placed 
<sic>placed</sic> the same in his family to be by

sent her to school and treated her in 
all aspects as he would his own child

become strongly and affectionately attached 
to said child and that her attachment 
for them is no less than that of an 
affectionate child for its own parents</p>
