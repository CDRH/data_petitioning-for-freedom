the defendant in <unclear> obedience </unclear> of the writ issued <unclear></unclear> with <unclear></unclear> with the child who is of the age of 7 yrs. and pleads that her mother is re adjudicated issue is <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear>and it appears from the <unclear></unclear> of this court <unclear></unclear> of Chambers <unclear></unclear> </p>

<p> June  30 1871 Plffs filed in this court a petition against defats for a writ for the child in question. <unclear> seeking </unclear> <unclear> out</unclear></p>

<p> 1 That they are legal parents and named guardians of child in question. </p>

<p> The <unclear> aucused </unclear> <unclear></unclear> issue as to these <strike> fo </strike> allegations and <unclear></unclear> others. </p>

<p> The  cause was heard before the Judge of this court who <unclear> remandered </unclear> the child to the custody of Defendants. </p>

<p> I filed the <unclear></unclear> of decree of divorce on the files as Evidence on the trial of this cause. </p>

<p> Looking at the whole record I am satisfied that the same issue is prescribed to this court.  That <unclear></unclear> prescribed and determined before his Honor Judge <unclear> Brunedy </unclear>.  Are of what the <unclear></unclear>upon. and while the Judges may form time to time be <unclear></unclear> this court is at all times the source. </p>

<p> In the case of the Teritory as Walla decided at December term 1873 the supreme court says </p>

<p> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear>

that may follow the settle adjudications of the court whatever <unclear> charges </unclear> be made in the <unclear></unclear> thereof </p>

<p> <strike></strike> </p>

<p> In order to settle a matter <unclear></unclear> <unclear> judicial </unclear> there must be a <unclear></unclear> of four conditions to wit 
<p> 1 Identity in the <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> for </p>
<p> 2 Identity of the cause of action </p>
<p> 3 Identity of persons and parties </p>
<p> 4 Identity of the quality in the persons for or against where the claim is made. </p>

<p> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> Jurisprudence <unclear></unclear> in the case of Habeas Corpus is this former order <unclear></unclear> a <unclear></unclear> to this <unclear></unclear> </p>

<p> It is said in <unclear></unclear> on Habeaus Corpus <unclear></unclear> the only has <unclear></unclear> where <unclear> here </unclear> <unclear></unclear> Jurisprudence <unclear> Exept </unclear> for so long as the <unclear></unclear> <unclear> excuses </unclear> <unclear> Sterias </unclear> <unclear></unclear> of the home of

the order remains unchanged </p>
<p> <unclear></unclear> H.Corpus 463 </p>

<p> In the <unclear></unclear> is the people it was held. That an adjudication of a writ of record or of an effect having authority to act in the matter. on the question of the custody of <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> child. brought up on Habeas Corpus. May be pleaded re adjudication and is <unclear> evidence </unclear> upon the <unclear> same </unclear> parties . in all future <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> to the same mother. and upon the same state of funds. </p>

<p> <unclear>25 March 63 </unclear> Paige <unclear></unclear> says in his <unclear> opinion </unclear> in that case </p>

<p> The former preceedings <unclear></unclear> a <unclear></unclear> to any <unclear></unclear> how of any matter which <unclear> accused </unclear> before his first order of a re adjudication on Habeas Corpus or <unclear></unclear> her the  <unclear></unclear> writ be <unclear></unclear> such <unclear></unclear> <unclear> controversies </unclear> may endure under the <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear>

or the death of the parties. Under further continuance <unclear></unclear> are <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> writ of liberty <strike></strike> will become an <unclear></unclear> of oppression </p>
<p> 25 March <unclear></unclear> page 99 </p>

<p> This case was decided by the court of <unclear> Eners </unclear> in 1840. in 1842 the case <strike></strike> was again before Supreme Court. in the case <unclear></unclear> by counsel. in 3 <unclear> April </unclear> 399 and the court further as they <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> to the decision in 25 <unclear></unclear> holding judgement on Habeas Corpus a <unclear></unclear> as to funds existing on the <unclear></unclear> of the judgement. </p>

<p> In the case in 25 March of page 94 the <unclear> Chancellor </unclear> says</p>

<p> The <strike> proceeding on Habeas Corpus </strike> principle of re adjudication is applicable to proceedings on Habeas Corpus and that it <unclear></unclear> make no difference 

in the application <strike> that the </strike> whether the writ was <unclear></unclear> before a court or Judge. for in neither case ought the party to be <unclear></unclear> to proceed <strike></strike> adjudication before the same court or officer. to <unclear></unclear> the former decision while the <unclear></unclear> remained the same.</p>

<p> A different view of the law is taken in 2 <unclear></unclear> 429. holding the doctrine such applicable on habeas corpus</p>

<p> but the court in that case say on page 430.</p>

<p> "<unclear></unclear> for judges will go in <unclear></unclear> execution after a case has once been determined is a question which must rest in that <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> judgement</p>

<p> I am <unclear></unclear> to think that <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> the <unclear></unclear> reasonable and at all <unclear> made </unclear>. I think the result would be evil. Were I to reverse a decision made by a former Judge of this court which is clearly re adjudication.

if new facts or issues are prescribed the case is exactly the same in all aspects. </p>

<p> I am of opinion <unclear></unclear> that on Habeas Corpus in a case with the facts as in this case <unclear> of law</unclear>  The judge can only determine who is legally entitled to the custody of this child </p>

<p> That is on wherin thus the law. bestowed the child </p>

<p> True as <unclear></unclear> say where a court <unclear></unclear>a decree of divorce that court may force time to time <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> as the facts may <unclear></unclear> but no such charge has been made in fact as the child is without the jurisdiction of the Oregon Courts. it is <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> any order of that court would be of any <unclear></unclear> but it is not now necessary to determine the

I am of opinion also that this court has no original jurisdiction in matters of guardianship. that is conferred on the court of Probate which has ample power to appoint and <unclear></unclear> guardians for any and all minors within the Territory on a proper case made and from such orders are <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> to this court. </p>

<p> <unclear></unclear></p>

<p> <unclear></unclear> 617 of our statue declares that no ward or Judge shall require <unclear></unclear> the <unclear></unclear> any judgement or process whereby a party is in custody upon any process issued on any prior judgement of a court of <unclear></unclear> jurisdiction </p>

<p> and <unclear></unclear> 628 applies this provision to suits relative to minors</p>

<p> <unclear></unclear> have seen that the judge in Habeas Corpus has the <unclear></unclear> of a court</p>

<p> Wherefore looking 

at the whole case I am of opinion that the judgement of his Honor Judge Kennedy awarding the child to the defendants is a <unclear></unclear> to this proceeding </p>

<p> The plea is therefore sufficient and the writ writ be dismissed</p>
