      <p class="tei_p">On reading and filing the petition of Mary Ellen Lyts, duly signed and verefied by her, whereby it appears that one <del>Mar</del> Francis Walter Lyts, a minor, is illegally imprisoned and restrained of his liberty <del>by one W. D. Lyts</del> and from the custody of said Mary Ellen Lyts, who is his mother and <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="entitled​">entitld</a> to his possession and custody; by one W. D. Lyts, at the City of Seattle, County of King, and Territory of Washington, and stating toherein the illegality consists, from which it appears to me that a writ of Habeas Corpus ought to issue:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is ordered, that a writ of Habeas Corpus issue out of and under the seal of the <del/> District Court of the Third Judicial District holding terms at Seattle, directed to the said W. D.
