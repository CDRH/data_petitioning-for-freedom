child Mary Alice Powers since the 3rd of November 1884 but she denies that said respondants
have wholly or exclusively had the control or possession of said child and she most
emphatically denies that she has or


ever did wholly or exclusively or in any other manner whatsoever abandon the said
child or refuse to own or recognize the said child for that all such allegations of
abandonment, desertion neglect and refusal to own and recognize said child are wholly,
entirely, maliciously, and wilfully false in whole and in part and in every particular
whatsoever and she denies that the custody and possession of said child by the said
respondants was ever permitted after towit March 1885. otherwise then in persuance
of an agreement between the applicant and her former husband that respondants should
keep and care for said child for pay pending the determination of her divorce suit
then pending against her then husband and until this Hon. Court should award the custody
of said child to her or to her said quondam husband, and be then desposed of agreeably
to such order of this Court

She denies that said respondents have or at any time ever maintained, supported or
cared for said child at or out of their individual or sole expense or otherwise


than for pay and compesation in money and she denies that she ever knew or heretofore
ever heard of their doing otherwise and she denies that she ever refused or failed
or neglected to claim and recognize said child

Second And for answer controverting the so called second cause set up by said respondants
in their said return your petitioner says

II
It is not true that she is a pauper or wayward or arbitrary or that she is poor in
the extreme or unable or unfit either physically or mentallly to maintain herself
and her child or that she is now living on the sufferance of goodly disposed people
or other kind of people whomsoever or that she is earning nothing save her bare subsustance
or that the said child is wholly dependent for care or maintenance or support upon
any person whomsoever save only herself and she denies all such allegations

II II
She denies that the said respondents are or ever were willing to care for



or support the said child for any length of time whatsoever or at all, at their own
expense or otherwise than for pay and compensation in money and she denies the sincerity
of all such allegatons of willingness to provide gratuitously for said child

Third And for a statement of new matter showing petitioners right to said child your
petitioner alleges

That heretofore court in the year 1885 Your petitioner commenced an action in said
District Court at Seattle against her then husband John Powers for a Divorce

That by mutual agreement between her and her said husband and the said respondants
said child was left in the care of respondants pending the said suit and until this
Court should award the custody of said child to her or her said husband, said child
to be delievered into whomsoever the Court should award such custody

That afterwards towit April 6th 1888 said action terminated and a decree was then


and then rendered by our said District Court granting your petitioner a divorce and
awarding to her the sole custody of said child

That afterward Court on the 7th of April 1888 Your petitioners demanded of said respondants
the custody of said child which demand was then and there refused and ever since has
been so refused

V
That respondants have been paid for their care and keeping of said child by said John
Powers and by your petitioner and their retention of said child now is the sole purpose
of money and gain

V II
That said respondents have colluded and conspired with the said John Powers through
malice and ill will toward your petitioner to defraud her out of the possession of
said child and for this reason and for gain as aforesaid they withhold from petitioner
the custody of said child and ignore and hold in contempt the authority of this Hon.
Court

V II II
That your petitioner never has abandoned


said child but has repeatedly and constantly asked for, demanded, prayed, and implored
said respondants and her said quondam husband to be permitted to have the custody
and care of said child, all which has been met by the most brutal language and the
most inhuman treatment. a bill of particulars of which inhuman treatment will be forwarded
at any time

V II II II
That she is abundantly able to support herself and said child and by her labor is
not dependent upon any person or persons whomseover but is as independant as any other
person or persons who have to labor for their support and she has many kind friends
who treat her far better than she ever was treated by her mother and step father

Fourth And for further cause and ground for relief as herein prayed your said petitioner
alleges

II
That the respondents are wholly unfit to have the care or control of said child or
any other child because they are immoral in their talk and extremely lewd in their


conversations and very profane in that and that they are ignorant irreligious low
vulgar and not respectable in any degree whatsoever and that they have no standing
of respectability in the community in which they live and that they are not now and
never have been persons of decency or morality for which reasons your petitioner has
withdrawn herself from their society and has sought and now continues in the society
of reputable and respectable persons

Wherefore your petitioner prays for the relief heretofore prayed in her petition filed
herein and for costs
Jennie Miller Powers
