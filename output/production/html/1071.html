    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On January 24th, 1919, a petition was filed by Nellie E. Hurt for her minor daughter of 4 years, June Lucile Hurt, who was allegedly taken by some sort of fraud and false representation to South Dakota by Sula Hurt and Henry Hurt whose relation to the petitioner is unknown. Her husband had recently obtained a divorce from her on the grounds of desertion. On January 27th, the writ was sustained and custody of the bound party was granted to the maternal grandparents of the bound party, Frantz S. Wilson and Jennie Wilson. Interestingly, the 1920 census records show that Frantz and Jennie represented June as their daughter, not their granddaughter. Nellie also apparently remarried by 1920 and was living with her husband and mother-in-law. </li>
