<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF
WASHINGTON, <del>NORTHERN</del> SOUTHERN DIVISION. </p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application 
of Tonka Bajlo for Writ of
Habeas Corpus.</p>

<note>1328</note>
<note>2459</note>

<p>The petition of Tonka Bajlo, of Seattle, of the County
of King and State of Washington, respectfully shows to the Court
that Tonka Bajlo is imprisoned and restrained of her liberty by
Ellis DeBruler, Commissioner of Immigration at the port of 
Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p>That said imprisonment and restraint are because of the
following facts, to-wit :-</p>
<p>That said Tonka Bajlo is a married woman working as a 
domestic at the occupation of housekeeping and cook in the city
of Seattle at 815 Charles Street; that while so employed she
was arrested upon a warrant issued by Hon. W.B.Wilson, Secretary
of Labor, upon the charge that she is "an alien found practicing
prostitution after entry." That on the 7th of April, 1913, a 
hearing was had by Thomas M. Fisher, Inspector and Examiner, at
Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p>That said Tonka Bajlo is confined by the Commissioner 
of Immigration at Seattle in violation of the Constitution of the 
United States; That at the hearing held on April 7, 1913, said
Tonka Bajlo was compelled to testify against herself 
upon a criminal charge; that she was not represented by counsel
and was not informed that she had the right to refuse to testify
on the criminal charge made against her; that she had no opportunity
to present evidence for or on her behalf; that on the evidence produced
at said hearing the Secretary of Labor has ordered that
said Tonka Bajlo be deported from this country to Austria from
whence she came, upon a criminal charge, that of practicing
prostitution after entry into this country. That she does not 
understand the English language and did not understand the nature
of the proceeding against her and when informed of the result thereof
she demanded that she have counsel and a rehearing.</p>

<pb/>
    
<p>That she has been a resident of the State of Washington
for one year and of the State of Pennsylvania for one year; that 
the charges against her are without foundation of law and fact,
and orders for her deportation have been made by the Hon. Secretary
of Labor without an opportunity to have a legal hearing
before the Hon. Commissioner of Immigration at the port of 
Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p>That said Tonka Bajlo is not committed or detained 
by virtue of any process issued on any final judgement or decree;
that the cause or pretense of such confinement according to the
knowledge and belief of this petitioner is that said Tonka Bajlo
is imprisoned and restrained of her liberty by reason of false
charges made and instigated against her by Jack Bajlo, her 
husband, who is seeking to wreak revenge upon said Tonka Bajlo
because of the fact that she refused to live with him by virtue
of his inhuman treatment of her and his constant and continuous
brutal acts of cruelty.</p>
<p>Your petitioner therefore prays that a Writ of Habeas 
Corpus may issue directed to the said Ellis DeBruler, Commissioner
of Immigration at the port of Seattle, commanding him
that he have the body of said Tonka Bajlo by him imprisoned
and detained, together with the time and cause of said imprisonment
and detention before Hon. Edward E. Cushman, Judge of the United
States District Court for the Western District of Washington,
Northern Division, at the Federal Building in Seattle, State of 
Washington, at <del>10 A</del> <add>2 p</add>M. on the 21st day of April, 1913, to
do and receive what shall then and there be considered and ordered 
concerning said Tonka Bajlo in pursuance of the statute in such
case made and provided.</p>
<p>DATED this 16th day of April, A.D. 1013.</p>
