    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Chinese minor immigrant Ng Kwack Kang was ordered for arrest and deportation after being denied admission to the U.S. by the Commissioner of Immigration. He petitioned for habeas and claimed to be the son of Ng Kum, born in Boston, Masschusetts, that he was not given a fair trial, denied right of counsel, and false evidence was used against him at his hearing. Neterer ruled on the contrary, and also claimed that there was not enough satisfactory evidence that Ng Kum was the father of Kwack Kang. Writ was denied.</li>
