was by said Justices postponed until
the 10th day of December A.D. 1885 at
the hour of ten o'clock A.M.</p>

reasons that said Justice had no 
Jurisdiction to issue said warrant
and that the same <add>was</add> wholly void and</p>

<p>that said Justice had no authority or

custody.</p>

<p>That said motion was overruled and
said Justice then proceeded to examine 
your petitioner as to the <del>affidavit
aforesaid and</del> matters and things 
set out in said affidavit; and
amongst other evidence heard by
said justice was the <add>pretended</add> ordinance of
said city hereafter referred to and
a copy whereof is hereinafter set 
out; to the consideration of which
ordinance defendant then and there
objected; that thereafter and on the 
10th day of December A.D. 1885

and costs of said proceeding as
hereinbefore mentioned, and to
stand committed until the same
is paid; upon which said judgement
the commtment heretofor mentioned

and figures following to wit:

or inhaling of opium.
<unclear>for</unclear> it ordained by the City of Spokane Falls.</p>

certified by the city clerk to have
been properly passed by the city 
council and to have been published
in Spokane Evening Review on 
Sept. 10 1885.</p>

<p>Your petitioner further represents
to your honor, that said restraint is
illegal for the following reasons</p>

<p>1- said Justice had no jurisdiction
to issue the aforesaid warrant and
the same was wholly void, for the
reason that no summons was issued
by said Justice at the time of or
before the issuing of said warrant,
and the said Justice for the same
reason had no jurisdiction to render
any judgement whatever against
your petitioner.</p>

<pb/>

<p>2- That said complaint states no
offense under said pretended ordi-
nance <del>for</del> and any judgement thereupon
rendered is void.</p>

is wholly void, for the reason that
said city council had no authority 
under this charter to pass <del><unclear></unclear></del>
the same on any ordinance
on the matter of opium smoking
or inhaling or keeping a house
therefor.</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays
that a writ of Habeas Corpus may 
be issued by the clerk of your Honor's
Court, commanding said Glispin
to bring your petitioner before your
honor, that the cause of her restraint
may be inquired into, and she
released thereupon, if the same be found
illegal.</p>
