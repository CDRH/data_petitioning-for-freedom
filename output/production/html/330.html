    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Golda and Rudolph Maurer were a couple living in Council Bluffs, Iowa. According to his WWI draft card, Rudolph Maurer was an clerk for American Express. On August 7, 1914, they had a baby girl, Marion Lavonne Maurer. However, on September 8, 1917, Rudolph decided to separate from his wife and move to Nebraska (an easy hop across the river), but it was agreed that Golda would retain custody of Marion. But only one day later, Rudolph, with the help of his family, including Julius Maurer, decided to take the girl. They told her mother that they just wanted to take her on a short trip, but, in fact, they absconded with her across state lines and never returned. Less than a month later, on October 2, 1917, Golda issued a writ of habeus corpus against Rudolph and Julius, demanding that they produce Marion in Douglas District Court. They complied, but their attornies subpoenaed many witnesses to testify on their behalf. The case was dismissed without prejudice on November 10, 1917, although an Omaha Daily Bee claims that the court awarded Rudolph custody of the child, but Golda "secured possession" of the child afterwards. In 1918, Rudolph filed for divorce against Golda, and claimed that he had no idea of the whereabouts of his wife and child.</li>
