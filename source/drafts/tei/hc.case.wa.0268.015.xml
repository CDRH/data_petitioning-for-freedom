<p>IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF THE NINTH
CIRCUIT, DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>In the matter of the petition of
ERNEST HUTCHINSON
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>No. 1183
Brief of Petitioner</p>

<p>Our first proposition is that a license means a permission
to do something certain in the way of a permission to do
a thing that otherwise would not be lawful, Therefor a license 
is that which circumscribes, regulates, restrains and gives the
right to control and prohibit. The poliy therefore of license is
to have under control and to that extent duress: to prohibit that
which might otherwise be a public nuisance or a public evil. Outside
of that the police power has no right to go. When it goes
beyond regulating, controlling or prohibiting that which is <del>not</del> a
nuisance or a public evil or which threatens to become a public 
wrong, the authority that grants the license exceeds its constitutional
power.</p>

<p>Therefore we have endeavored to present succinctly to Your
Honor the reasoning of the Courts along the lines here propounded
and as we believe <del></del> the constitutional lines upon which the question
of the constitutionality of the ordinance presented in this 
cause must be decided.</p>

<p>We first cite Your Honor to the following sections and
marginal headings.</p>

<p>Freund Police Power which is an entirely new work on this 
subject. We first the cite section 38:</p>

<p>S38. LICENSE AS A POLICE MEASURE. The license as a police
measure is properly only an incident to restraint or regulation
and should, therefore, not be upheld where there is no power to
restrain. Upon this principle an ordinance imposing a license fee</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>upon the owners of bicycles was declared illegal in Illinois, the
Court holding that the use of streets for private vehicles is as
much of a matter of common right as their use for walking on foot,
and that the charter power to regulate the use of streets cannot 
be made the foundation for a restraint upon the exercise of common 
rights except for specific purposes of order or safety. The ordinary
use of the wheel was held to justify no restraint upon this 
principle, and upon this theory the decision seems sound; for it
would not be maintained that a license might be required for walking
on the streets. Discriminative licenses may be justified by
the conditions of a business; thus it had been held that a municipal
corporation may impose license fees on meat shops kept outside
of the public market, since they require special supervision;
and licenses may be graded according to the amount of business done.</p>

<p>We next cite section 93.</p>

<p>S 93. RESTRAINTS UPON BUSINESS AND UPON PARTICULAR DEALINGS.
Certain classes of business may be placed under special control
because they furnish facilities for the commission of crimes or for
their concealment. Crimes may to some extent be prevented by properly
restricting the sale of weapons, poisons or explosives; and
their detection may be facilitated by a strict supervision of these
trades. The law, may, therefore, forbid the sale of poisons except
upon responsible prescriptions; and it may require the keeping
of registers showing every sale of weapons, with the name of the
purchaser. As stolen goods usually find their way into the hands
of pawnbrokers or dealers in second-hand goods, these trades may 
be kept under control by the requirement of a license by demanding
reports and authorising inspection. </p>

<p>Again we cite section 494.</p>

<p>S 494. LEGITIMATE GROUNDS OF RESTRAINT AND PROTECTION FROM
COMPETITION.   In <del></del> an earlier portion of this treatise the attempt
has been made to assign the various restrictions to the several 
heads of the police power, and it had been shown that they may be</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>reduced to the following classification: prevention of crime or
of its concealment (pawnbrokers, junk dealers), protection of
morals and order (liquor selling, public amusements), prevention
of fraud (peddlers, auctioneers, employment offices, insurance,
warehousing), and protection of health and safety (the great mass
of other restrictions.</p>

<p>It may be said that where none of these public interests comes
into play, there is no warrant for the exercise of the police power
but it must be asked whether this limitation gives adequate protection
to the principle of liberty. There are few trades that
cannot be exercised as to endanger in a remote degree health
and safety, or so as to expose the public to fraud. There are very 
few cases indeed in which restrictions will be avowedly based upon
the desirability of restraining competition on the part of free citizens
(the competition of convicts and of foreigners is met by legislation)
is no legitimate ground of state interference, for the greatest and 
most successful exertion of industry and genius by legitimate
methods cannot be regarded as detrimental of the public welfare.
Thus not attempt at legislation against department stores has been
successful. To prevent an abuse of the police power for the alleged
<del></del> protection of health or saefty or the alleged 
prevention of fraud, the courts must be allowed to judge whether
restrictive measures have really these ends in view. A remote abd
slight danger should not be <del></del> recognized as a sufficient ground
of restriction, and the provisions of the law should be scrutinized
in order to see whether they in reality tend to effectuate their 
object. By general consent the police power at present does not
interfere for these purposes. Even for the prevention of fraud only
these forms of business are restrained which present exceptional
facilities for imposition upon the public, or which invite the 
public confidence in an extraordinary degree. So for the protection</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>of morals as a rule only those pursuitsare controlled which have 
a notorious connection with vice or disorder.</p>

<p>This last citation states the law of the case and is a 
summary of the jurisprudence covering the matter of police power
in the administration of justice in the United States.</p>

<p>Here ia a harmless business; a harmless contract; a lawful
way of doing your business; and the general plan of trading
amongst business men. What is injurious; what is immoral; what 
tends to a nuisance; what in connection with the trade stamp business
tends to evil or crime; what is the thing that justifies 
restraint? Nothing. The business is lawful; the contract is lawful.
There is nothing in the contract or trade agreed to by the 
parties that justifies control or that tends to evil, immorality
or a public nuisance. There is nohing that endangers the public. </p>

<p>The Grocers' Association undertakes to control the business
of Seattle. It undertakes to say how you will carry on your 
business and if you do not fix the prices according to their schedule
you will be boycotted. Here is a more dangeroud association 
than anything in the trading stamp business as illustrated in this 
cause or in any cause that the courts have passed upon</p>

<p>It was for this association that the ordinance was passed.
To protect this association from the liberal use of printers' ink
and the right of contracting or advertising this ordinance was
passed. It was conceived in inquity and is kept on the statute
books for the purpose of doing wrong. In other words here are 
men engaged in conspiracy to keep up the prices of the commodities 
and get the council to pass an ordinance protecting them.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Thus the combine would prohibit the legislation competition
and to that extent so far as they could protect themselves by 
legislation - <del></del> prevent the engagement of others in business that would
interfere with their methods of trade.</p>

<p>This ordinance requires that $600.00 shall be paid by 
the man who comes in here to start up a business in trading stamps
as set forth in the petitioner's appeal for justice. From the 
man who enters into business with him is exacted $100.00. This 
he is restrained and prohibited from engaging in a legitimate enterprise
and lawful business as a competitor against the man in business who under
the rules of his association <del></del> fix and maintain prices or goods 
in this market.</p>

<p>With this we ask Your Honor to consider the following
authorities which we believe are decisive in this case.</p>

<p>We say that the matter presented to your Honor here
was not presented to the Supreme Court and if it had been presented
we believe that the decision would be different.</p>

<p>We also say to Your Honor that you are not bound by that
decision and upon this point we ask the consideration of the 
authorities submitted.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>UNITED STATES COURTS.</p>

<p>Comity between U.S. and State Courts</p>

<p>Exception as to General or Co mmerical Law.</p>

<p>This court will not follow State decisions which do not 
present a clear case of construction of a State statute, but
assert general principles. Venice v. Murdock, 92 U.S. 494, 23: 583.
Genoa v. Woodruff, Id. 502,23:586.</p>

<p>Where private rights are to be determined by the application
of common-law rules alone, this court does not feel bound 
by State decisions. Chicago v. Robbins, 2 Black, 418, 17:298.</p>

<p>Decisions of State courts are not binding upon questions
concerning contracts of insurance, those being questions of general 
commercial law. Carpenter v. Providence Washington Ins. Co. 16
Pet. 495. 10: 1044.</p>

<p>The courts of the United States are not controlled by the 
decisions of State courts in questions of general Commerical Law.
Brooklyn City, etc. R.R. Co. V. Nat.. Bank of Republic, 102 U.S.
14, 26:61</p>

<p>Boyce v. Tabb, 18 Wall. 546, 21:757.</p>

<p>Delmas v. Merchants Mat. Ins. Co. 14 Wall 661, 20:757.</p>

<p>The construction placed upon a State statute by the highest
court of that State, in a case where the decision did not necessarily 
involve the construction of the construction of the statute, is not binding
on this court. Carroll v. Carroll, 16 How. 275, 14: 936.</p>

<p>In deciding whether a State statute is uncontitutional as violating
a contract by the state, if the decision of the existence 
of an alleged contract requires a construction of the State Constitution
and laws, this court is not necessarily governed by previous 
decisions of the State Courts, except where they have been so firmly
established as to constitute a rule of property. Louisville
&amp; N.R.R.Co. v. Palmes, 109 U.S. 244, 27:922.</p>

<p>The decision of the State court, constructing a statute which
is claimed to constitute a contract, is not conclusive on the Supreme
Court of the United States, where there is a claim that it 
was a contract the obligation of which had been impaired. Wright
v. Nagle, 101 U.S. 791, 25:921. Jefferson Branch Bank v.
Skelly, 1 Black, 436. 17:173.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court will put an independent construction on the 
validity of a municipal ordinance, where the question involves its 
repugnance to the Constitution of the United States. Yick Wo v.
Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 30:220.</p>

<p>The nature of Taxation generally, what uses are public and
what are private, and the extent of unrestricted legislative power
are matter which, like questions of commerical law, no state can 
conclusively determine for this court. Olcott v. Fond du Lac County,
16 Wall. 678, 21:382.</p>

<p><del>In the matter of the application of Ernst Hutchinson for Writ 
of Habeas Corpus</del></p>

<p>Is ordinance No. 6036 of the City of Seattle void?
<note>City Code 423</note></p>

<p>Ordinance No. 6036</p>

<p>"An ordinance to license and regulate certain trades and occupations
in the City of Seattle, providing penalties for violation thereof
and repealing all ordinances inconsistent therewith."</p>

<p>"To license and regulate certain trades and occupations."</p>

<p>What are "trades and occupations"?
Wesbter says:</p>

<p>"Trade, n. 1. A track; a trail; a way; a path; also, passage; travel; resort.
2. Course; custom; practice; occupation; employment.
3. Business of any kind; matter of mutual consideration; affair; dealing
4. Specifically; the act of business of exchanging commodities by
barter or by buying and selling for money; commerce; traffic; barter.
5. The business which a person has learned, and which he engages in,
for procuring subsistence or for profit; occupation; especially,
mechanical employment as distinguished from the liberal arts, the
learned professions, and agriculture; as, we speak of the trade of a 
smith, of a carpenter, or mason, but not now of the trade of a farmer,
or a lawyer, or a physician.
6. Instruments of any occupation.
7. A company of men engaged in the same occupation; thus, booksellers 
and publishers speak of the customs of the trade, and are collectively 
designated as the trade.
8. pl. The trade winds.
9. Refuse or rubbish from a mine.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Syn. -Profession; occupation; office; calling; avocation; employment;
commerce; dealing; traffic.</p>

<p>Trade, v. i. 1. To barter, or to buy and sell; to be engaged in the
exchange, purchase, or sale of ggods, wares, merchandise, or anything
else; to traffic; to bargain; to carry on commerce as a business.
2. To buy and sell or exchange property in a single instance.
<del></del>
Trade, v.t. To sell or exchange in commerce; to barter."</p>

<p>What is occupation?</p>

<p>Webster answering this says:</p>

<p>"Occupier, n. 2. One who follows an employment; hence a tradesman.
Occupy, v.2. 1. To take or hold possession of; to hold or keep for
use; to possess.
2. To hold, or fill, the dimensions of; to take up the room or space
of; to cover, or fill; as, the camp occupies five acres of ground. 
3. To possess or use the time or capacity of; to engage the service
of; to employ; to busy.
4. To do business in; to busy ones self with."</p>

<p>Bouvier defines trade thus:</p>

<p>"Trade. In its most extensive signification this word includes
 all sorts of dealing by way of sale or exchange. In a more limited
sense it signifies the dealings of a particular business, as the 
India trade; by trade is also understoof the business of particular
mechnaic, hence boys are said to be put apprentices to learn a trade
as the trade of a carpenter, shoemaker and the like. Trade differs 
from art.</p>

<p>2. It is the policy of the law to encourage trade, and therefore
all contracts which restrain the exercise of a man's talents in trade 
are detrimental to the commonwealth, and therefore void; though he
may bind himself not to exercise a trade in a particular place, for,
in this last case, he may pursue it in another place, the commonwealth
has the benefit of it."</p>

<p>Let us now look into the constitutional phase of the case.
We will first examine its relation to the Constitution of the
State, and for aid in this examination we will cite such parts of the
State Constitution and of the State Law as we believe have any bearing
on the question before the court.</p>

<p>Here then we will first call attention to the provisions of the 
State Constitution.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Art I.</p>

<p>Declaration of Rights</p>

<p>S1. All political power is inherent in the people, and governments
derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and are
established to protect and maintain individual rights.</p>

<p>S3. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without
due process of law.</p>

<p>S8. No granting irrevocably an privilege, franchise, or immunity 
shall be passed by the legislature.</p>

<p>S12. No law shall be passed granting to any citizen, class of citizens
or corporation other than municipal, privileges or immunities which 
upon the same terms shall not equally belong to all citizens
or corporations.</p>

<p>S29. The provisions of this constitution are mandatory, unless by
express words they are declared to be otherwise.</p>

<p>S30. The enumeration in this constitution of certain rights shall
not be constued to deny others retained by the people.</p>

<p>S32. A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is essential
to the security of individual right and the perpetuity of free government.</p>

<p>Art. VII.</p>

<p>Revenue and Taxation</p>

<p>S1. All property in the state, not exempt under the laws of the
United States, or under this constitution shall be taxed in proportion
to its value, to be ascertained as provided by law. The legislature
shall provide by law for an annual tax sufficient, with other
sources of revenue, to defray the estimated ordinary expenses of the
state for each fiscal year. And for the purpose of paying the state 
debt, if there be any, the legislature shall provide for levying a 
tax annually, sufficient to pay the annual interest and principal
of such debt within twenty years from the final passage of the law
creating the debt.</p>

<p>S2. The legislature shall provide by law a uniform equal rate</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>of assessment and taxation on all property in the state, according
to its value in money, and shall prescribe such regulations by general
law as shall secure a just valuation for taxation of all property,
so that every person and corporation shall pay a tax in proportion
to the value of his, her, or its property; Provided, That a deduction
of debts from credits may be authorized; Provided further, That 
the property of the United States. and of the state, counties, school
districts, and other municipal corporations, and such other property
as the legislature may by general laws provide, shall be exempt from
taxation; And provided further, That the legislature shall have
power, by appopriate legislation, to exempt personal property to the
amount fo three hundred ($300.00) dollars for each head of a family 
liable to assessment and taxation under the provisions of the laws 
of this state of which the individual is the actual and bona fide owner.</p>

<p>S5. No tax shall be levied except in pursuance of law; and every
law imposing a tax shall state distinctly the object of the same to
which only it shall be applied.</p>

<p>S9. The legislature may vest the corporate authorities of cities, o
towns and villages with power to make local improvements by special
assessment or by special taxation of property benefited. For all 
corporate purposes, all municipal corporations may be vested with 
authority to assess and collect taxes, and such taxes shall be uniform
in respect to persons and property within the jurisdiction of the body 
levying the same.</p>

<p>Art. XI.</p>

<p>County, City and Township Organization.</p>

<p>S10. Corporations for municipal purposes shall not be created by
special laws; but the legislature, by general laws, shall provide for 
the incorporation, organziation and classification in proportion to 
population, of cities and towns, which laws may be altered, amended
or repealed. Cities and towns heretofore organized or incorporated
may become organized under such general laws whenever a majority of</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>the electors voting at a general election shall so determine, and
shall organize in conformity therewith; all cities or towns heretofore
or hereafter organized, and all charters thereof framed or adopted 
by authority of the constitution shall be subject to, and controlled
by general laws. Any city containing a population of twenty thousand
inhabitants, or more, shall be permitted to frame a charter for
its own government, consistent with and subject to the constitution
and laws of this state, and for such purpose the legislative authority
of such city may cause an election to be had, at which election there
shall be chosen by the qulified electors of said city fifteen freeholders
thereof, who shall have been residents of said city for a period 
of at least two years preceding their election and qualified electors,
who duty it shall be to convene within ten days after their election
and prepare and propose a charter for such city. Such proposed charter 
shall be sbmitted to the qualified electors of said city, and if a 
majority of such qualified electors voting thereon ratify the same,
it shall become the charter of said city, and shall become the organic
law thereof, and supersede and existing charter, including amendments
thereto, and all special laws inconsistent with such charter. Said
proposed charter shall be published in two daily newspapers published
in said city for at least thirty days prior to the day of submitting
the same to the electors for their approval, as above provided. All
elections in this ection authorized shall only be upon notice, which
notice shall specify the object of calling such election and shall
be given for at least tne days before the day of election, in all
election districts of said city. Said elections may be general or
special elections, and, <del></del> except as herein provided, shall be governed
by the law regulating and controlling general or special election 
in said city. Such charter may be amended by proposals therefor submitted
by the legislative authority of such city to the electors thereof 
at any general election after notice of said submission, published 
as above specified, and ratified by a majority of the qualified electors
voting thereon. In submitting any such charter, or amendment
thereto, any alternate article or proposition may be presented for the 
choice of the voters, and may be coted on separately without prejudice
to others.</p>

<p>S11. Any county, city, town or township may make and enforce within
its limits all such local police, sanitary and other regulations as
are not in conflict with general laws.</p>

<p>S12. The legislature shall have no power to impose taxes upon counties 
cities, towns or other municipal corporations, or upon the inhabitants 
or property thereof, for county, city, town, or other municipal purposes, 
but may, by general laws, vest in the corporate authroities
thereof the power to assess and collect taxes for such purposes.</p>

<p>S13. Private property shall not be taken or sold for the payment of
the corporate debt of any public or municipal corporation, except in
the mode provided by law for the levy and collection of taxes.</p>
