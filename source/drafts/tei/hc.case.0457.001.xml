<p>In the Circuit Court of the United States,
for the District of Washington.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Soo Hoo Wing
for Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>To the Honorable the Judges of the Circuit Court of the United 
States for the District of Washington:</p>

<p>Your petitioner respectfully shows that he is a resident of
the City of Portland, Oregon, and has so been since June 1892.
That since said time your petitioner and his said wife have
lived and cohabited together as husband and wife, in the City of
Portland, Oregon until the 21st day of January, 1893. That on the 
said 21st day of January, 1893, while the said Fue Gam was lawfully
engaged in the discharge of her duties in her own home in the 
said City of Portland, State of Oregon, and while in company with
your petitioner, she was forcibly abducted, taken and carried away
by one D. W. West, and forcibly and against her will and against
the will of your petitioner, taken from the State of Oregon and
carried to the State of Washington, and there imprisoned in the
County Jail of Kings County in the City of Seattle, where she is
now confined and imprisoned illegally and against her will.</p>

<p>That said jail is in charge of <del></del> Woolery Sheriff of said 
Kings County and the said Fue Gam is now detained and unlawfully
held and imprisoned in said jail by said Sheriff.</p>

<pb/>

<p>Your petitioner further shows that the cause of said detention
is as follows:</p>

<p>That one J. W. Spriggs a United States Commissioner at said
City of Seattle, assuming to be in the discharge of his duty as
such Commissioner, has pretended to try the said Fue Gam upon the
charge of being a prostitute and of having unlawfully entered the
United States from a foreign country, to-wit: from British Colum-
bia, for the purpose of prostitution, and of being guilty of living
a life of a prostitute since coming to this county as aforesaid,
and of being now unlawfully in the United States contrary to and 
in violation of Section 5 of the Act of the Congress of the
United States of America, passed March 3rd,1875, and upon said 
trial the said Commissioner did pretend to adjudge said Fue Gam
guilty as charged in the said complaint, and did adjudge that she
be deported from the United States to Beitish Colubmbia.</p>

<p>That said imprisonment is not on account of any other order,
judgment or process than that herein set forth, and your peti-
tioner further shows that unless the prayer of your petitioner
is granted, said order will be executed and the said Fue Gam will
be deported forcibly and against her will and unlawfully from the 
United States to the Province of British Columbia.</p>

<p>And your petitioner respectfully shows that the said Commissioner
was without authority to make such order and that the same is
illegal and void. That said Fue Gam was never in said State of 
Washington until taken there forcibly as aforesaid, and was never
inthe Province of British Columbia.</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays that a Writ of Habeas Corpus
issue out of and under the seal of this Honorable Court directed
to the said <gap></gap> Woolery,Sheriff of said Kings County,</p>

<pb/>

<p>Washington, directing and commanding him to have the body of said
Fue Gam before the Honorable the Judges of the Circuit Court for 
the District aforesaid, at the United States Court House in the
City of Portland, Oregon, at the time and place therein to be 
specified, to do and receive what shall then be adjudged concern-
ing her, the said Fue Gam, together with said Writ and the cause
of detention, and that the said Fue Gam may be restored to her
liberty.</p>

<p>Soo Hoo Wing</p>

<p>State and District of Oregon,
County of Multnomah.</p>

<p>ss.</p>

<p>I, Soo Hoo Wing being first duly sworn, say that I have read the 
foregoing petition, and that the statements therein contained are
true as I verily believe.</p>

<p>Soo Hoo Wing</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 3rd day of February, 1893.</p>

<p>Victor C Bellinger</p>
<p>Notary Public for Oregon.</p>
