    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Al Atkinson, confined in the Douglas County jail, was facing extradition to Canada for his alleged involvement in the violent theft of liquor, a firearm, and other items belonging to one Robert Andrist. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming, among other things, that the procedure leading to his arrest and detention were inconsistent with treaty obligations between the United States and Canada. After hearing the evidence, his writ was denied and Atkinson remanded to the custody of his jailer.</li>
