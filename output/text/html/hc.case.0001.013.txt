I am 21 years old I think I dont know how old my sister   my sister is older has been
married to Teller as near as I know 4 years   while they lived together they lived
there at that place - I had been living in that place about two months when Teller
was killed - there was an agreement between myself and Teller



by which I was to work the place up there  arrangement included the work and use of
the horses spoken of - I was to live then with my sister and she to keep me - the
working of the place - between 35 and 40 acres under cultivation - Teller had been
at home prior to killing   there day before (Monday) saw Mr Teller on Monday evening
at home no one else there - Mrs Teller came there with me - he was setting in the
house - about between sun down and dark - Mrs Teller returned about not long after
she went there - House and kitchen joined are only rooms - I slept in the N.E. Corner
of the house bed on the bed on the floor Mr Teller slept in the south west corner
bed mound  a little from the side - he slept with Mary his wife - dont know which
one got up first I was asleep - my bed about three feet from door heading to kitchen
before I got up. I heard no conversation between Teller and wife - they had been quaralling
during the night - It was about the horses he wanted to know what she came to Spokane
for what business she had at Spokane and what business she had to come there that
night - next morning did not hear any conversation before going to get the horses
- she was in the kitchen when I spoke of getting the horses told her I would get the
horses

didnt you say to her this Mary while your getting breakfast Ill go and get horse to
do that rolling -   I said Ill go and get the horses. I might have said it but I dont
remember it - Mr Teller was in the house when I made the remark - and was not doing
anything - standing up Teller said let the horses alone he would tend to horses -
he should have known for what purpose I was to get the horses - I think I have mentioned
to him that night I was going to roll - was going to get them to roll the ground he
spoke right out in a partly rough way rougher than he usually spoke. Teller done nothing
then since he gave me in charge of the place 7 horses - dont hardly know  why I did
not go and get them not ever having any trouble with Teller preferred not to  when
Teller forbid me getting the horse - I done nothing then before Teller said she would
go and get them - Teller said nothing - she did then start to get the horses dont
know how long she was after them not long - dont think 10 or 15 minutes. Horses were
out East of the house say 350 or 400 yards. I think she could go in that time I dont
know what Teller was doing - I went out to the old house left Teller in main house
- that to the old house fix a line on the harness - did not go for horses because
I feared difficulty with Mr Teller. There has been a gun kept there prior to the killing
all the time - I would know the gun   shown gun  identifies it as the one in the evidence



usually kept in the door in the main  went into the kitchen - did not notice gun Monday
night when I got home - I saw it Tuesday morning setting in the corner of the house
- dont know whether loaded or not - If  Teller went out without the gun and turned
the horses loose without the gun I do not know it - I do not know it  the second time
he went out to turn the horses loose that I have spoken of - It could have happened
that he went out without my knowledge - I heard Mr Teller make threats to Ms Teller
when he went with the gun "if you dont have those horses loose Ill shoot you" I did
not hear him threat to kill her if she did not leave the place that morning. I did
at   I was the friday before that in the house - " If you dont leave here Ill shoot
you or burn you out" I did not hear Teller say to my sister in the morning that if
she did not take the clothes and go away I will burn you out or kill you some night"
I did say to my sister that Mary that I was afraid Teller would do her some harm and
for her to be on her guard told her this because he had made so many threats I thought
he might - I told her this from Teller threats &amp; manner that morning - when I first
saw Teller with gun he was coming out of the house - Mrs Teller was coming up to the
gate - held gun one hand with barrell one butt just ready to fetch it to her face



Witness illustrates - walked toward her carrying gun in same position - gun cocked
when he came out I did not see him cock it - I know who took the gun  down - Frank
Teller took it down that morning - first words I heard him are when he had the gun
in his hands was "saw you turn those horses loose and leave here or I will kill you"
he was about 6 or 8 feet from her when he used those words - he continued to advance
upon her when he said that - she made no reply that I heard after saying that he walked
right up and pointed the muzzle in her face - she then knocked the gun on side and
pulled the pistol and shot one shot at that time - Hand with real position she did
not fire but think only one - he fell backwards and partly down and she turned one
horse loose - he then straighted himself up and attempted to point his gun at her
again - said then turn the horses loose or he would kill her - she then picked up
slat or club and hit him on the head with it two or three times - 

In answer to a question  Is it not a fact that she shot again instead of striking
witness answer  I dont know that I seen that   In answer to the question "is it not
a fact that she did not strike him until she had fired all the shots that the pistol
did fire - dont know that I saw that either

After she struck him he hardly got to his feet again when she fired last time he was
coming toward her she did shoot at him after striking him with the board - she hit
him two or three blows as near as 



I can tell  - all shown  after she fired the shots she did not that I saw hit him
after firing the last shot - he was on his feet when she fired last shot - when she
fired last shot fell over on his face toward her   Shown diagram - she was was standing
about in the gate he the length of the yard from her - she did not stand there when
she struck him

Isnt it a fact that after she fired the first shot from the gate that he staggered
back toward the middle of the yard and that when he attemted for the revolver that
she advanced upon him

ans - he advanced a little - I saw where he fell after the killing the diagram represents
similar place to where he fell - I think three shots in the pistol - I know where
Mrs Teller got the pistol - after Teller taking the shot gun down and loading it I
went to her and told her I feared he was going to do her some harm and gave her the
pistol and told her to protect herself - that was in the morning just after she had
started for the horses - they for was from him taking down the gun loading it and
setting it in the corner - and from the further threats he had made for her - when
she said she would go and get the horses he said nothing - I did not see Mrs Teller
hit him with anything but that peice of board - she could not have hit him with anything
else without my seeing it

to go forwad before he got up she shot and he fell on his face dont know whether his
feet in same place as when she struck him - did not have the gun when he tried to
get up - I dont know as whether his feet moved or not after seemed shot he did not
get up when he fell last time cant state how far his hand for gate dont think defendant
brought horse inside - halter straps 8 or 10 feet long - I had advanced two or three
steps when he fell last time  I went and crawled under the fence and caught a horse

one side to let  out

When I went of the door with awl I dont know



as that there was any splinters or chips with blood on or not   I knew where the ax
was in the morning of the killing - it was at the wood pile at end of old house shed
- the ax was between me and the old house when I saw Teller go out with gun - I dont
know where board by was laying when she picked it up - think it has been used for
a bed slat - bed sister and Teller occupied had slats - dont know the size - when
I started out to give pistol to sister bed was not made up dont know whether a slat
was gone or not - never been inside the house since until he died did not notice condition
