    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Ella Epps, mother of Georgia A. Risch, petitioned on behalf of her grandson Henry Laverne Risch. Georgia and Arthur A. Risch had started proceedings for a divorce around the time of the petition, but had agreed to leave Henry with Ella while the divorce was going on. Ella described Arthur as an alcoholic, "a man of violent temper" and often used "vile, violent and obscene language" towards Georgia. Georgia was also only 17, meaning that Arthur must have married and impregnated her at the age of 15 or 16 at the latest. Epps then claimed that Arthur violently took Henry from her on August 5, 1913 and placed him in the care of two individuals referred to as Mr. and Mrs. Lyons. Henry was sick and in need of certain medications and care. Ella stated that they refused to let Georgia see him or provide him with necessary medication. The writ was allowed and Henry was placed in the immediate custody of Georgia. </li>
