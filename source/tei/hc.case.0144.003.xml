That on said date defendant moved
the court to discharge here for the

that said Justice has no authority or
Jurisdiction to within defendant in

Which said pretended ordinance was
certified by the city clerk to have
been properly passed by the city 
council and to have been published
in Spokane Evening Review on 
Sept. 10 1885.

Your petitioner further represents
to your honor, that said restraint is
illegal for the following reasons
1- said Justice had no jurisdiction
to issue the aforesaid warrant and
the same was wholly said, for the
reason that no summons was issued
by said Justice at the time of or
before the issuing of said warrant,
and the said Justice for the same
reason had no jurisdiction to render
any judgement whatever against
your petitioner.

2- That said complaint states no
offense under said pretended ordi-
nance <del>for</del> and any judgement thereupon
rendered is void.
3- That said pretended ordinance 
is wholly void, for the reason that
said city council had no authority 
under this charter to pass
the same on any ordinance
on the matter of opium smoking
or inhaling on keeping a house
therefor.
Wherefore your petitioner prays
that a writ of Habeas Corpus may 
be issued by the clerk of your Honor's
Court,commanding said Glispon
to bring your petitioner before your
honor, that the cause of her restraint
may be inquired into, and she
released thereupon, if the same be found
illegal.
