<p>My dear 
parents it is under very disagreeable 
circumstances that I now write these few lines 
hoping that you will see the immediate necessity 
of either sending me my free papers or something 
to prove who I am for I am now in 
Jail <unclear>with</unclear> no prospect of getting out without my 
proving myself free please write as soon 
as possible. I shall direct this to Frederick at 
the Broadway hotel for I do not know where 
you live at.. you must excuse this I have 
to write on my knee.. I have been in jail 
now for more than a week and have not 
had an opportunity of writing before.. 
give my love to mother, sister, Frederick, Gardnor 
Jones and all enquiring friends no more 
But remain your <del>undifect</del> undutiful 
son</p>

<p>George W. Turley</p>

<p>Direct yours to the <unclear>case</unclear> of Mr. Jas <unclear></unclear> 
Martin Esqr Chesnut Street St Louis, MO <unclear>upon</unclear>
