Du Breuil a Justice of the Peace within and 
for the County &amp; State aforesaid Louis St 
Ange who being duly sworn upon his oath 
says that he did apprehend ^in the City of St Louis a negro woman 
calling herself Rebecca Moore about 40 
years of age of a black color, &amp; about 5 feet 
<del/> high, which said negro woman 
having no free papers or any thing to establish 
that she is free he has good reason and 
does believe she is a runaway slave 
and from papers found in her possession 
that she belongs to one Amos Webb
