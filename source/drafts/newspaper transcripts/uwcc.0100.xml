<p>Chinese Laborers.&#8212;Upwards of a hundred and twenty Chinamen have come here from Tacoma in the last three days, for the purpose of working on the grade of the Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad. The Messenger brought down twenty on Wednesday, and forty-five last night; besides a few on other boats. Their stay here will probably be short, for most of them will be engaged in the hop yards two months hence. Say what you will against the Chinese, they are not drones, and if work will not come to them the will go to it, and the greatest public works of this coast have been rendered practicable only by the abundance and economy of their labor.</p>
