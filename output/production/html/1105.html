    <li>Summary of Proceedings: H. C. Littooy, a U.S. citizen who practiced dentistry, applied for a writ of habeas corpus on June 11, 1904. Littooy stated that he had been repeatedly arrested and detained for the offense of practicing dentistry without being licensed by the State Board of Dental Examiners, an offense that violated a 1901 Washington law. His petition claimed that, despite his experience in dentistry, the Board would not allow him an examination because he had no diploma from a dental college. The petition claimed that the licensing law was a violation of Section One of the 14th Amendment because it was "class legislation" and because it infringed upon his right to "equal protection." Judge Hanford commanded that Sheriff Edward Cudihee show cause for Littooy's detention. Prosecuting Attorney W. J. Scott and Washington State Counsel Samuel R. Stern responded for Cudihee and stated that the petition should be dismissed because Littooy should instead seek remedy in the Superior Court of the State of Washington. Judge Hanford denied and dismissed the petition, stating that the lack of blatant unconstitutionality of the licensing law meant that directly appealing to a higher court would be more appropriate than habeas corpus. Newspaper articles stated that Littooy was fined $200 and was part of a larger group of dentists that were challenging the law; it is unclear if he remained in detention. </li>
