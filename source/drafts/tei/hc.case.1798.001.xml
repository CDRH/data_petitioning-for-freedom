<p>Territory of Washington,
Second Judicial District, Ss.</p>

<p>Before Roger S. Greene
Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court
At Chambers
Eighth January, A.D. 1879</p>

<p>In the matter of
the Petition of S.
W. Hall for a Writ
of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Territory of Washington
County of Cowlitz, Ss.
Daniel Delaney, being
first duly sworn deposes
and says, I know
George H. Holliday;
I knew him since
the fall of 1859 at Carlin-
ville, Macoupin County,
Illinois; I was person-
ally acquainted with
him; he was a friend
of mine; he was the
person that gave me
my naturalization
papers; I was person-
ally acquainted with
him until the fall
of 1870 or the spring
of 1871; he was a
man of high standing
in our county, busi-
ness transactions
called me sometimes
to see him; at the
time he gave me my
naturalization papers
he was county clerk,
and the Probate Court
was in session - it was
in the fall of 1859; I
lived in Girard, a small
town north of Carlinville
and was in the trolley
business, and Mr. Holli-
day would frequently
come over to the town
and would call and see
me as he would <unclear></unclear>
of his friends; I have
seen him quite often,
have ridden with him
on the cars and have
been as familiar with
him as a man would
want to be; have seen
him frequently in his
office in shirt sleeves;
I am as satisfied that
this prisoner is George
Holliday as that I
am Dan. Delaney;
I know I cannot
be mistaken.</p>

<p>Daniel Delaney
sworn to and subscribed
before me, this 8th day
of January, A.D. 1879</p>

<p>Roger S. Greene,
Assc. Justice of the
Supreme Court of
Washington Territory</p>

<p>Received from Judge R.S. Greene
Filed January 17th 1879
R.G. O'Bruin
Clerk</p>
