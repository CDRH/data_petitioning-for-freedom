    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Evelyn Burress Miller died of the measles on May 18, 1882. She was survived by her husband, Louis Miller; her infant daughter, also named Evelyn Miller; and her parents, Thomas and Catherine Burress. In the wake of his wife's death, Louis left his daughter with her grandparents for several months. When he tried to retrieve Evelyn, Thomas and Catherine refused to surrender her. In the summer of 1883, he unsuccessfully petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the Nemaha County and district courts. Louis remarried a few years later and resumed his attempt to re-establish custody of Evelyn. When the Burresses refused, Louis, now living in Ohio, petitioned for habeas relief in federal district court in 1889. After a lengthy hearing, which the newspapers covered in salacious detail, the court determined that Louis should have custody of his daughter, who was now eight years old. Thomas and Catherine appealed in federal circuit court to no avail. Eventually, the parties agreed that Louis would have custody of Evelyn but that her grandparents could visit at reasonable times. However, when Louis tried to board an eastbound train with his daughter in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Catherine assaulted him. She and Thomas seized their granddaughter and returned to Nebraska. The case file makes no mention of Evelyn's ultimate fate.</li>
