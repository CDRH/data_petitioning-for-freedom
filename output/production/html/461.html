    <li>Summary of Proceedings: The bound party, Samuel Summers, was issued a warrant in the County of Tallahatchie, Mississippi for the crime of knowingly receiving stolen property over the value of $100 by Justice of the Peace J. B. Ray. On August 23rd 1918, the bound party was arrested upon report of McArthur, K. B., allegedly without an issued warrant. On August 27th 1918, the wife of the bound party, Maggie Summers, and attorney for the petitioner, John M. Macfarland, filed a writ of Habeas Corpus naming Chief of Police Micheal Dempsey and Jailer George Stevens. In response, Geo Holmes, police magistrate, issued a letter detailing the reasoning for confinement and the previous warrant from Mississippi. On August 30th, Justice Geo Holmes issued an arrest warrant for the bound party who was already, at that point, in custody. The following day on August 31st, the application for the writ was granted and Summers is released from custody.</li>
