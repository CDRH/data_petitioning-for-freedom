<p>United States Circuit Court
District of Washington
Northern Division.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Petition of
ERNEST HUTCHINSON
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>No. 1183. Filed May 16
1904.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM DECISION ON THE MERITS.</p>

<p>Ordinance No. 6036 of the City of Seattle requires
a person carrying on business as a pawn broker to pay one
hundred dollars per annum for a license, and exacts payment
of six times as much for a license to sell trading stamps
to merchants, in addition to a license fee of one hundred 
dollars per annum which each merchant using trading stamps
in his business is required to pay. It is very apparent
that the purpose of this ordinance with respect to trading
stemps is, to prohibit their use in retail trade as a means 
of drawing custom; rather than to provide revenue, or to 
exercise in a reasonable manner the police power of the 
city, The giving of trading stamps is merely one way of
discounting bills in consideration for immediate payment 
in cash, which is a common practice of merchnats, and is
doubtless a popular method and advantageous to all concerned,
and it is not obnoxious to public policy. The</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>ordinance, therefore, is oppressive, and an invasion of the
liberty of the people to carry on legitimate business by
the use of legitimate means.</p>

<p>In the case of Seattle v. Barto, 31 Wash. 141, the
Supreme Court of this state affirmed the validity of Ordinance
No. 6036 in so far as it relates to pawnbrokers, and
in its opinion the court said in effect that, the fee of 
one hundred dollars per annum required of pawnbrokers, is
not so exorbitant or disproprotionate to the cost of police
surveillance that the court could without proof of special 
hardship deny its constitutionality. The court was not reaquired
to and did not express an opinion as to the validity 
of the subdivisions of the ordinance relating to the selling
and use of trading stamps.</p>

<p>Admitting the principle that the city government
 is invested with discretionary power to license different
trades and occupations, and that the rule of uniformity in
taxation, is not violated by differences in rates, the cases 
of Fleetwood v. Read, 21 Wash. 547, Stull v. DeMattos, 23
Wash. 71, and State v. Clark, 30 Wash. 439, are easily distinguishable
from this case, and I am not required to comment 
on those decisions. </p>

<p>For the reasons above set forth, it is my opinion 
that subdivisions 1 and 2 of Sec. 7 of the ordinance under 
consideration are an unwarranted abridgement of the privileges
of citizens and void, and that the imprisonment of the
petitioner thereunder is a deprivation of his liberty in</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>violation of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States. Therefore I direct that a judgment
be entered discharging him from custody.</p>

<p>C.H. Hanford
Judge</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Form No. 599
1183
No.</p>

<p>In the Circuit Court 
Of the United States
for the
District of Washington</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Petition
of Ernest Hutchinson
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>Memorandum Decision on the Merits.</p>

<p>Filed in the U.S. Circuit COurt
Dist of Washington.
