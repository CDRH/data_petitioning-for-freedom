<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application
of Tonka Bajlo for the Writ of
Habeas Corpus.</p>
<p>No. 2459</p>

<p>BRIEF OF GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>If the Court has not already, either in connection 
with this case, or the accompanying habeas corpus case of
Marie Miller, examined the following statutes and cases, we
respectfully ask that he glance through them, where he will
find the legal principles governing this case more clearly
stated than I could hope to do.</p>

<p>Act of February 20, 1907, as amended by Act of March 26,
1910, Sections 20, 21 and 22;
DeBruller v. Gallo, 184 Fed. 566, adn cases there cited;
United States v. Ju Toy, 198 U. S. 253, 49 L.Ed. 1040;
Chin You v. United States, 208 U. S. 8, 52 L.Ed. 369;
Bottlier v. Donseuguey, 130 U. S. 238;
Zakonaite v. Wolf, 226 U. S. Sup. Ct. Rep., 272.</p>

<p>The record in this case under the principles there laid 
down presents the following questions for determination by
the court:</p>

<p>I.
Was there anything "unfair", arbitrary or despotic in
the executive proceedings under which the alien has been
ordered deported? The only matters in which it is claimed
that there was any unfairness are the following:</p>
<p>(a) The warrant of arrest gave prostitution as the ground
<pb/>
for deportation, while the findings of the officer
gave in addition the commission prior to immigration
of an offense involving moral turpitude, and liability
at time of entry to become a public charge; and the 
finding fo the Secretary of Commerce, included in the 
warrant of deportation, is based upon prostitution and 
liability at time of entry to become a public charge.</p>
<p>(b) The findings of the local officer to the Secretary, included
in the report on which the Secretary acted, stated
a material conversation with the alien in which she 
admitted illicit relations with other men and also his
judgment that she was a prostitute, based in part on
his observation of the condition of her room.</p>
<p>(c) Errors in translation of the evidence embodied in the 
return on which the Commissioner of Labor acted.</p>

<p>II.
Was there any evidence on which the findings of the 
Commissioner could be based, or were they clearly without 
foundation, arbitrary and despotic?</p>
<p>The vie of petitioner's whole brief is an assumption
that the proceedings are a trial on a criminal charge or
analagous thereto, and that similar rules will prevail.
The requirement of the law is merely this - that the
Commissioner shall be "satisfied" that the alien is subject 
to deportation. No manner in which he shall so satisfy 
himself is laid down. If, as in this case, by his decision 
he announces that he is satisfied, that ends the matter
unless it clearly appears that his alleged "satisfaction" 
is an unfair, arbitrary and despotic thing, arrived at without
giving the alien any fair opportunity to show the facts.</p>
<p>See statutes and cases cited at beginning of brief.</p>
<pb/>
<fw>-2-</fw>
<p>I. (a)
Applying these principles to the alleged unfair procedure
in failing to include in the warrant the commission of
crime before entry and liability to become a public charge
at that time, we see at once that unless it appears that the
alien was unfairly deprived of some opportunity by this
fact, no review will lie. This is not a case of indictment
where every thing must be pleaded. It is not even
like a civil case at law, though there a pleading will
in this state be considered as amended to correspond with 
the facts. It is a summary proceeding and unless essentially
unfair methods have been adopted, the writ will not lie. 
Obviously there is nothing essentially unfair in deporting
an alien for matters brought out at the hearing at which
she was present, and where she was given an opportunity 
to have counsel and present any and all matters she might 
have, even though such matters were not known to the officers
when the investigation started and hence were not included
in the formal warrant for her arrest. The technical rules
of criminal pleading cannot be injected into this procedure.</p>
<p>For a further reason petitioner's objection in this
respect must fail. The order of deportation and the warrant 
of Commissioner on which he expresses his satisfaction 
recited that the alien is one found practicing prostitution,
sufficient in itself to justify deportation, and the very
ground stated in the original warrant (page 5 of Record
included in return). Therefore, even though the Secretary 
had no authority to consider anything else, yet the fact
that he did so, would be immaterial, since his actin
within the limits of his admitted authority justifies the
holding of the alien and her deportation.</p>
<pb/>
<fw>-3-</fw>
<p>I. (b)
Was it proper for the inspector to include as a part
of his return to the Secretary of Labor, his personal
observation and conversation with the alien? Most certainly
it was. He would have been derelict in his duty had he 
not done so. And it was proper for the Secretary to consider
such matter in reaching his conclusion. The alien had a 
full opportunity to explain her relations with the men in 
the house and the circumstances surrounding her residence
there. The matters referred to in the inspector's report
were fully gone into at the hearing, and she denied that
there was anything immoral in relation thereto. Nevertheless
it was eminently fair and proper that the inspector
state his ideas in which he had gained from personal conversation
and observation. Of course in a court of law he 
would have been sworn to these matters, but these proceedings 
were not in a court of law, and where the alien has been 
given a change to show her version of the facts it is
obviously not improper or unfair for the inspector to include
his own personal observations in the report.</p>
<p>I. (c).
Is the report submitted to the Secretary unfair and
distorted in that a material part of the statements were
omitted or distorted by the interpreter? It may be admitted
that since the decision of the Secretary is the 
vital matter in these proceedings, any substantial discrepancy
in the report, by which the Secretary is misled 
as to material matter, is a very serious charge, not only 
as to the fairness of the hearing, but also against the
local officers personally, and a charge not to be inferred
<pb/>
<fw>-4-</fw>
unless its truth is firmly established. These matters are:</p>
<p>(1) That Tonka is reported as saying that she worked for
$2.00 per month, while by her affidavit she says that
her statement showed $2.50 and $5.00 per month from
each of several men. Your Honor well knows how frequently 
a witness will fail to express on the stand all that
he has on his mind. This is clearly such a case, but 
even if the witness did say what she now claims she
meant to say, we fail to see how she has been injured. 
Vaska Belen, or Joe Miler, to use his English name, 
testified to practically the same thing (Record p.22).
However the question as to whether she received $2.50
or $10.00 per month in addition to her board is entirely 
immaterial in determining whether she was a prostitute
or liable at time of entry to become a public charge.
It would not even be evidence on which to grant a new
trial in criminal action - much less will its 
accidental misinterpretation (if indeed it was misinterpreted)
justify habeas corpus in this proceeding.</p>
