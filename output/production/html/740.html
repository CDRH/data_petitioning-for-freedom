    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On May 21, 1887, Moses Cline (also known as BM Cline or Moses Brown Cline) filed a writ of Habeas Corpus on behalf of his four-year-old daughter, Elnora Cline, in the Third Judicial District Court in King County, Washington. Elnora had been living with her mother and Moses' wife, Ella Cline, in Seattle since April 15, 1887. Moses claimed that as a single mother, Ella would be unable to maintain the best interest of Elnora and that as a caring and capable father he not only possessed a legal right to custody of his child, but that Elnora would benefit from being in his custody. In response, Ella maintained that she had a legal right to custody of Elnora and that Elnora's age required the care of her mother. While the remaining files for the case are missing following Ella's return to the writ, Elnora seems to have gone into Moses' custody for a brief period, given that Moses listed Elnora as the sole other member of his household on the 1889 Kitsap County Census. </li>
