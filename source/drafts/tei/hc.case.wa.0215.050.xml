<p>U.S. Department of Labor</p>
<p>Immigration Service</p>

<p>In the matter of the arrest of SOMENEUSKE SAITO, GIN KATO, SEID YIM, CHUNG HIM, SAM GUM</p>

<p>Brief</p>

<p>In as much as I do not care to encumber the record in these cases with briefs covering the same matter and inasmuch as the circumstances and what might be termed extenuating circumstances I herewith beg to submit my brief in the above cases.</p>

<p>At the outset I take it that the Immigration Service and Department of Labor is composed of off-icials who are human and that an appeal to the reasonableness and fairness of the matter and the good that will result from an order either in favor of the above named Aliens or against them will be considered by your Department. In other words I am given to understand that the Government has made out a "prima facia" case on the statement of the Local Inspector with reference to these Aliens being employed in a house of prostitution, and I argue this case upon that assumption.</p>

<p>Many years ago, approximately 20 years, the little town of Ketchikan started its growth. It, being a town in the far famed Alaska, and what may be termed a frontier or far Western twon, had to live and grow in the true Western or frontier manner. One of these mannerisms seemed to be that it was frequented by women of the underworld. They started to live here. Then as mothers and the best women of the land came into our midst and for the sake of good morals it became necessary for these women of the underworld or prostitutes to be isolated in a district so that they could be regulated. Without argument I admit that to-day the City of Ketchikan has such a district, it is not only known to the officials of the Department of Justice, the Territorial officials, the City Officials. The line is even regulated, and it is a very well regulated line, by the local officials. Now, during all these years the inmates of this line or restricted district have employed Japanese or Chinese cooks, and not one up to the time of these arrests had ever been disturbed. In fact if I may be permitted to go outside of the record on a well known fact that colored women have been warned by the officials of the Department of Justice of this City or who are officially in this City to keep off of the line or they would be arrested. The prostitutes have been given permission to employ Chinese or Japanese cooks. Now why was this done, simply because the women would interfere with the business of the prostitutes and the Chinese and Japanese are neither pimps, macques or disolute persons and rather aid the officials than cause the trouble. Has any Japanese or Chinese person ever been arrested on the line for any kind of disturbance? Most emphatically no. Where do they live? In their own cabins. Where do they eat? In their own cabins. What do they do on the line? Cook two meals and leave. (See the testimony of them all.)</p>

<p>Is it the intention of this Department to work hardships on these men? I believe not. Surely this Department could not be accused of the unfairness charged by Hon.Louis F. Post against the Honorable A. Mitchell Palmer. Then what have we to deal with in this case or these cases.</p>

<p>Just picture, if you will, Someneuske Saite, commonly known as Fred, a little Japanese boy coming to this country when he was but 16 years of age to learn to speak English and TO BE AN AMERICAN. What course did he take to become one? He applied to the Captain of one of our ships in the Navy to learn English and was taken on board the ship. Could any person have a higher rating at the end of his service? I defy the world. Did he quit with serving just</p>

<pb/>

<p>one term? No. And when the question arose as to his being under heighth his Captain recommended and urged the waiver of this condition and this recommendation went through the military or naval channels to the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation and the Surgeon General of the U.S.N. and they authorized the waiver of the physical disqualification and he was reenlisted. You will also note that one of these discharges was during the Spanish American War.</p>

<p>After having served five times and having become fairly well versed in the English language this Japanese finally came to this City of Ketchikian and started a business. He has been in this town over 16 years and nearly 20 years. He has seen the atititude of the people and the officials regarding the restricted district during its existence in this City. Never has an Oriental been arrested nor warned but instead encouraged to work on the line during all these years.</p>

<p>In the year 1905 in order to become a citizen of the United States he applied for and received his first papers. And since that date thought or at least felt that he was a citizen. Even though the issuance of the paper was not legal or proper and confers no rights upon him still why should he be expected to know that when the Deputy Clerk of the U.S. District Court did not know it.</p>

<p>Now we have "Fred" a man of 47 years of age. A little old Japanese arrested on the charge of working in a house of prostitution and facing a charge of being deported. For w-hat? For working in a house of prostitution, if we take the officers word for that and I am not attempting to deny it in this manner, for the period of 4 months. Mind you, just four (4) months altogether. Other Japanese and Chinese had done it for years and never been arrested or warned that it was illegal. But here is little "Fred" a man of 47 years of age. A little old Japanese arrested on the charge of working in a house of prostitution and facing a charge of being deported. For w-hat? For working in a house prostitution, if we take the officers word for it and I am not attempting to deny it in this manner, for the period of 4 months. Mind you, just four (4) months altogether. Other Japanese and Chinese had done it for years and never been arrested or warned that it was illegal. But here is little "Fred" an old man for a Japanese, having served faithfully in the U.S.Navy, having renounced his allegiance to Japan and her rulers, have declared his intention to become a Citizen of the United States, having purchased a home to spend the rest of his days in, having no relatives in Japan to whom to return, having lived in the United States 33 years of his 47, or therabouts, and ONE JAPANESE WHO WOULD FIGHT WITH THE UNITED STATES AGAINST HIS OWN MOTHER COUNTRY, JAPAN, a man who loves this country and wants to live and die here and a man against whom one word cannot be said to discredit him. Never has bee-n arrested, how many Americans can say that, in the course of his 33 years in this country. Now to be deported for working where he did not know it was wrong to work for only 4 months in all and right here I can safely say and prove my statement that outside of 25 people in this City including lawyers and officials none of the rest of the people know that it is against the law for foreigners to work in these houses, then why expect this man to know. It is further the custom and practice and I am in a position to know, being at the present time Municipal Magistrate of the City of Ketchikan, to warn these people, I mean inmates of that district, these workers never having to be warned, before any action is taken because inasmuch as the line is illegal it is only permitted to be run because it is the wish of all the business men and the great majority of people in this City. For this reason these men expected to be treated the same as the inmates at least and therefore their surprise and astonishment when arrested FOR THEY KNEW OF NO WRONG THAT THEY HAD COMMITTED, while I am not trying to argue that before a man is to be arrested he must be warned for that would be ridiculous in the extreme but they were entitled to expect the same treatment as the inmates at the very least and again in view of the fact that during all these years IT HAS BEEN THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF THE IMMIGRATION OFFICERS TO GO THROUGH THIS DISTRICT AND INTERVIEW ALL FOUND THERE AND KEEP AN ACCURATE RECORD OF THE SAME FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE IMMIGRATION LAWS AND DURING ALL THESE YEARS THESE COOKS FOUND EMPLOYED THERE WERE INTERVIEWED AND THE FACTS NOTED BUT NEVER A PROSECUTION FOR VIOLATION OF THE IMMIGRATION LAW OR WARNING AND THESE MEN KNOWING THESE THINGS AND THAT THIS HAD ALWAYS BEEN DONE AND BEING LEAD TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT AGAINST THE LAW IN THIS MANNER SURELY CANNOT BE PLACED IN THE SAME POSITION AS ANY OTHER CASE THE COUNTRY OVER AND DEPORTED WITH A ROUGH HAND.</p>

<p>GIN KATO</p>

<p>Now let us look <del><unclear>the</unclear></del> over the record of Gin Kato. He came into this country in 1884. He has never been back to Japan. He is 60 years old and has been in this country 36 years of the 60. Has worked on two Revenue Cutters with excellent discharged from both. He has been in Ketchikan 12 years and has seen the same state of facts above stated. And in all the 36 years has never been arrested. He has worked 7 months in these houses in all. He is a man with a clean record and with recommendations as long as your arm. He did not know it was wrong to work there.</p>

<p>SEID YIM</p>

<p>This Chinaman came to this country when he was 16 years old and he is now about 59 years old. About 30 years ago he went back to China for a visit and was there just a few months and that is the only time he has been back. This man worked on the line just 5 weeks and 1 day. He was told that it was alright to work in these places and having been in this City for 5 years and during all that time no one had been warned or arrested for working there and there being no question as the it being alright to work there and the question never even entering his mind he started work. He has never been arrested before in all his 43 years in the United States. During the recent War this man relieved another cook in order to allow that cook to enter the U.S. Army.</p>

<p>CHUNG HIM</p>

<p>This man came to this country a good many years ago, he has been back to China just once many many years ago. Just think of this old Chinaman, 65 years old, bending over the ironing boards in Louie's Laundry working many hours a day for a scant living, then being offered a cooking job, there being no question of the work being against the law for the others were doing it openly knowing no wrong and others had done it here always, and then working for only two months and being arrested. In all his many many years in this country he had never been arrested. Not a mar on his record.</p>

<p>SAM GUEM</p>

<p>Sam came to this country when he was 20 years of age and has been here 42 years making him 62 years old. He has been back to China just once. Has been working in the house just 6 weeks. He has been in this City 5 years and know that it was considered absolutely alright for him to work there and had never heard to the contrary, had never even thought of it being wrong, why it could not be or something would have been done. Here is another man that is in a partnership with a Chinaman who is a citizen of the United States. The citizen was married but claimed no exemption, wnated to fight for the United States. He had to get some one to take his place and as he was the active manager of the business to run the business. This man Sam volunteered his services and all through the War took his place at his own sacrifice. Sam has large business interests to take care of. He is a man all the way through and knowing this many many whites and orientals have borrowed from him and if he were deported he would have to go practically penniless. On account of the fishing season being the lucrative season and at the end of which is the period of paying all debts he could only get his money by being here personally then and being on the job and the season lasts about 6 months. He also has property interests that would require about a similar time if he is</p>

<pb/>

<p>to be allowed the privilege of going home, or to China with at least a pittance, if he is deported.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to say that not one of these men have ever been arrested before. They have been in this country, all of them I believe, for over 30 years. They are not gamblers, drug users or sellers, they are not a public charge nor a liable to be, and if I would be permitted to do so and if it would help in this case I would like to be given an opportunity to submit a written statement or petition signed by I believe practically all the business men of this City stating that each and every one of these men are good, hard working, conscientious, sober, honest, law abiding men. They are respected by the community as a whole as good men. I am assured of this fact by many of the business men who are leaders of this City and I personally know these men and I take a personal interest in this case for that reason.</p>

<p>The deporting of these men in my opinion would parallel the charge made by the Honorable Louis F. Post as referred to herein.</p>

<p>What good will result? Just one word would have stopped it all. What benefit will derive to the people of the United States? If it will be a benefit to deport two old Japanese and three old Chinamen for working on a publicly recognized restricted district and one which the people of this City have publicly asked the authorities to leave as long as well regulated and which was made publicly and signed by the Mayor of this City and others, yes many others. If it will benefit the United States or its people to put these men in disgrace for the rest of their lives and to die in disgrace in a few years for the strict construction of the law where no possible good can result, then of course I will have to submit to it. The word has been given, the law has been declared, results have been accomplished. What more can be asked?</p>

<p>These men will never do that kind of work again and no other Orientals will ever work there again.</p>

<p>They all say and I know it to be the truth that they would never have worked there if they knew it to be against the law. They say, why were we not told?, why did they not publish it so that the Chinese would know, are they not proper questions? At least, for these men who had been given to understand  or lead to believe there was no trouble in it. It meant the same to them as any other job. They did not sleep there, nor eat there. They just cooked two (2) meals and left. They did their eating and sleeping at their own homes. What is wrong with that, only a purely strict interpretation of the law unknown to them.</p>

<p>I BEG YOU IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE, REASON, GOOD COMMON SENSE, to quahs these warrants and let these men have their liberty. I know that I may expect a fair deal from your Department or Bureau and I want you to examine this matter carefully. It means much to these men. They all have only a few years to live. Now on a mere technicality are you to end their days with this matter.</p>

<p>If your decision is adverse to my clients I at least beg for a stay of 6 months for "Fred" or Somensuske Saito and Sam Guem.</p>

<p>I distinctly want it understood that I have not a single word or blame or criticism for our Local Immigration Inspectors. They could not be better men or officers. Neither have I for the Bureau or Department or any of its officials.</p>

<p>I ask for justice and fairness and in my opinion JUSTICE, FAIRNESS and COMMON SENSE will turn them loose.</p>

<p>MOST RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED</p>

<p>Attorney For Aliens</p>
