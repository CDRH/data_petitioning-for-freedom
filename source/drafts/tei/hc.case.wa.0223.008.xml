<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT
OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION
OF CHIN SHEUNG WING, FOR A WRIT
OF HABEAS CORPUS.</p> 
<p>No. 3072
PETITION FOR WRIT.</p> 
<p>Comes now Chin Sheung Wing by his father Chin Kim and
petitions the Honorable Court for a Writ of Habeaus Corpus and
alleges the facts to be as follows:</p> 
<p>That Chin Kim, father of the applicant, was born in
the United States and is now and has been ever since said time
a citizen of the United States of America; that on May 24th, 1901
a proceeding was had to determine the status of Chin Kim in the
United States District Court for the District of Washington, same
being cause #2017. The United States District Judge, Hon. C. H.
Hanford then and there found that Chin Kim was a citizen of the
United States.</p> 
<p>Upon Chin Sheung Wing making application to be admitted
to the United States, the immigration officials at Seattle, Wash-
ington, contrary to the law and wholly in abuse of their authority,
refused to take the findings of the United States Court regarding
the nativity of Chin Kim and denied Chin Sheung Wing, son of
Chin Kim, admission upon the grounds that he was not the son of a
citizen of the United States, this being on or about June 25th, 1915.</p> 
<p>An appeal wes taken to the Department at Washington D. C.
and the Commissioner in Seattle was sustained, all of which is
unfair, unlawful and contrary to the treaties between the United
States and China, being an abuse of discretion, defrauding this
applicant out of his legal rights.</p> 
<p>That the applicant will be deported to China unless
restrained by this Honorable Court. That said restraint and
<pb></pb>
imprisonment by the immigration department is illegal, unlawful
and not warranted in law.</p>
<p>This applicant is able and willing to defray all
expenses incurred herein and will deposit the necessary amount
therefor.</p> 
<p>Daniel Landon
Attorney for Petitioner.</p> 
<pb></pb> 
<p>State of Washington
County of King }ss.</p> 
<p>Chin Kim being first duly sworn on
oath says that he is the Father of Chin Sheung Wing applicant
in the above entitled action; that he has read the foregoing Petition
knows the contents thereof and believes the same to be true:
Chin Kim</p>
<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 15 day of July 1915
Daniel Landon
Notary Public for the State of Washington, residing at Seattle</p>
