    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Ethel Johnson was arrested on February 9, 1919 for keeping a "Common Illgoverned House." She was tried at police court under magistrate Charles E. Foster on the tenth and sentenced to thirty days in prison plus court costs. While she was sentenced to city jail, she was moved to county jail on February 12, which Johnson claimed in her case was irregular and not what the magistrate had ordered. She filed a petition for a writ of habeus corpus on February 13, which was issued. In her petition, she argued that the charges against her were not specific enough to charge her with a crime&#x2014;a bold claim, given the shyness about sex in the early 20th century&#x2014;and that the ordinance outlawing prostitution in the city of Omaha did not provide for prison sentences above ten days. However, in court on the 14th, she asked for her own case to be dismissed, likely because she had just filed another writ of habeus corpus against Clark.</li>
