The petition of the undersigned respectfully shows:

That George Grant is unlawfully imprisoned, detained, confined and restrained of his

confined by a committing 



magistrate for this alleged commission of an alleged offense which if committed by
the said Geo Grant is one for which no punishment is provided for by the statues of
this territory court that of having carnal intercourse with an animal (a mare.)

Wherefore your petitioner prays that a writ of habeas corpus may be granted directed
to the said Archer S Bowles sheriff as aforesaid. Commanding him to have the body
of the said George Grant before you at a time and place therein to be specified, to
do and receive what shall then and then be considered by your herein concerning him
together with the time and cause of his detention and said writ: and that he may be
restored to his liberty.
