No.5954</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>In the District Court of the 3rd
Judicial District of Washington Territory
holding terms at Seattle W.T.</p>

<p>In the matter of the
application of Charles Smith
for a writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>To the Hon. R.A. Jones, Judge of
the District court of the 3rd Judicial
District of Washington Territory holding terms
at said City of Seattle</p>

<p>The petition of Charles Smith
respectfully shows;</p>

<p>That Charles Smith is unlawfully imprisoned,
detained, confined and restrained of his
liberty by John Coldwell at his office
on Washington Street in said City of Seattle
in said King County Wash. Terr.</p>

<p>That the said imprisonment, detention,
confinement and restraint are illegal and
that the illegality thereof consists in this
to wit; That upon the the face of said warrant
or process
<add>under and by virtue of which said Smith was arrested and is detained</add>
it appears that no offense has
been committed contrary to the laws of this
the Territory of Washington. That said writ
does not state that the defendant has
removed or dispased of his property or is
about to do so with intent to defraud his

<pb></pb>

creditors, but simply state that "on the
9th day of May 1888, Charles Smith left his
late residence with intent to defraud his
creditors" and the said Writ is therefore
and for other reasons shown upon the face
thereof fatally defective and void, and the
said imprisonment, detention, confinement and
restraint thereunder is illegal.</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays that a writ
of Habeas Corpus may be granted directed
to the said John Coldwell commanding
him to have the body of said Charles Smith
before your honor at a time and place
therein to be specified, to do and receive
what shall then and there be considered
by your honor concerning him, together
with the time and cause of said detention
and said writ, and that he may be restored
to his liberty</p>

<p>Dated on the 10th day of May
A.D. 1888</p>

<p>Charles M. Smith
Peterson + Haller
Attys. for said Chas. Smith</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Territory of Washington
County of King</p>

<p>Charles M. Smith being
first duly sworn on oath says: That he is the petitioner named
in the above entitled action; that he has heard the foregoing
petition read, knows the contents thereof, and believes the same to be true;
<del>that he makes this affidavit because</del> Charles Smith</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 10th
day of May 1888</p>

<p>Fred. H. Peterson
Notary Public in and for Washington Territory</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>$500</p>

<p>No. 5954</p>

<p>In the District Court 3rd
Judicial District, holding terms

<p>In the Chas
Smith petition
for habeas
corpus</p>

<p>FILED
MAY 10 1888
W.E. Ledgerwood,
Clerk.</p>
