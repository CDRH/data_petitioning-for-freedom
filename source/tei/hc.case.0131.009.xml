<p>Whereas I have been informed this 25th day of
Dec. A.D. 1884 that A.L. Beardon death was caused
by unlawful means. I have summoned a 
jury and proceeded to inquire the death
of said A.L. Beardon.
The Jury being duly sworn proceeded to 
view the remains and then examined
the witnesses where statements are here-
unto attached. After the examination 
of the witnesses the jury retired for delib-
eration and reviewed the verdict also
attached. Dr. M.A. Lyle sworn statement 
is also attached. A warrant was issued by 
me and given to Deputy Sheriff J. Friedlander

I hereby certify that the above is a true
record of the inquisition held by me.
