    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Jim Ryan filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against H. P. Haze (the police officer in charge of the Omaha Work House) on December 20, 1917. Ryan's petition stated that, on November 24, 1917, Ryan was charged by the Police Court with "Unlawful possession of Liquer." The Police Magistrate of Omaha tried Ryan, found him guilty, and sentenced him to sixty days of imprisonment in the Work House and required to do "Hard Labor." Ryan's petition alleged that his sentence and commitment were illegal because the prohibition law that he was charged with violating stated that all imprisonment sentences imposed by magistrates would be served in the County Jail. It was commanded that Haze bring the body of Ryan before judge Willis G. Sears to show cause for Ryan's detention. Ryan's application was denied, and it is likely that he remained in custody.</li>
