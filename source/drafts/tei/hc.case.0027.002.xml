detained and held from your petitioner he prays that a 
writ of habeas corpus may issue directed to the said Mary Anne 
Scheiber and Henry Steinberg requiring them to produce the 
body of the said Edward Scheiber and on the truth of the 
foregoing allegations appearing that the said Edward may be 
delivered over to the possession of your petitioner</p>
