<p>In the United States District Court, in and for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division</p>

<p>No. 6215</p>

<p>Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Writ of Certiorari</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Fletcher Decker for a Writ of Habeas Corpus and Writ of Certiorari.</p>

<p>Comes now Fletcher Decker, by and through his attorneys, Beeler &amp; Sullivan, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, and a writ of certiorari, and in reference thereto alleges as follows:</p>

<p>That on the 3 day of August, 1921, the said Fletcher Decker was arrested by the United States Marshal for the Western District of Washington, under and by virtue of a pretended warrant of arrest issued by Robert W. McClelland, United States Commissioner at Seattle, Washington, in a proceeding entitled, "In the matter of the Extradition of Fletcher Decker," instituted before said Commissioner for the extradition of said Fletcher Decker from the United States to the Dominion of Canada, under the extradition treaty between the United States and Great Britain, and the statutes of the United States relating thereto.</p>

<p>That on the 25th day of August, 1921, a hearing was held before said Commissioner in said matter of the extradition of Fletcher Decker, and such proceedings were thereupon had that said commissioner did on the 27th day of August, 1921, render a pretend judgment, or order, therein, among other things finding that said Flercher Decker should be extradited from the United States to the C<add>D</add>ominion of  Canada, and ordering that he be committed and held pending the further action of the Secretary of State of the United States, a copy of Which judgment or order is hereto attached, marked Exhibit A, and hereby referred to and made a part of this petition.</p>

<p>-1-</p>

<pb/>

<p>That on the 26th day of August, 1921, the said Commissioner did issue a pretended commitment directed to the United States Marshal for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division, commanding him, the said Marshal, to commit the said Fletcher Decker to the King County Jail, there to remain pending further proceedings for his surrender to the Province of Saskatchewan, Dominion of Canada, a copy of which commitment is hereto attached, marked Exhibit B, and hereby referred to and made a part of this petition.</p>

<p>That acting by and under the direction of said pretended commitment the said Marshal incarcerated said Fletcher Decker in said King County Jail, and continued to and now does keep him imprisoned therein and restrains him of his liberty.</p>

<p>And your petitioner further informs this Honorable Court that said imprisonment, confinement and restraint is illegal, in this, to-wit:</p>

<p>That the said Robert W. McClelland, Commissioner as aforesaid, is without lawful right, authority and jurisdiction to do or perform any matter or thing concerning extradition under any of the extradition treaties of the United States and the laws of Congress relating thereto, and by reason thereof said warrant of arrest, hearing, judgment or order, and commitment were and are illegal, null and void.</p>

<p>That said warrant of arrest was and is illegal, null and void for the reasons, first, that the complaint made before and filed with said Commissioner fails to show that said Commissioner had jurisdiction in matters relating to extradition, and, second, that said warrant of arrest fails to recite, allege or show upon its face that said Commissioner, who issued the same as aforesaid, had any right, power or authority in law to issue the same.</p>

<p>That the evidence, documents and proogs submitted upon said hearing fail to show that said Fletcher Decker committed any offense</p>

<p>-2-</p>

<pb/>

<p>against the laws of the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE, your petitioner prays that this Honorable Court enter its order directing the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus directing the said Marshal to have the body of said Fletcher Decker before the Court at a time and place to be fixed therein, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered concerning the said Fletcher Decker, together with the time and cause of his detention.</p>

<p>And your petitioner further prays that this Honorable Court enter its order directing the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus directing the said Marshal to have the body of said Fletcher Decker before the Court at a time and place to be fixed therein, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered concerning the said Fletcher Decker, together within the time and cause of his detention.</p>

<p>And your petitioner further prays that this Honorable Court enter its order directing the issuance of a writ of certiorari, directing the said Robert W. McClelland, Commissioner as aforesaid, at a time to be fixed therein, to transmit to this court all papers, files, records, documents, proceedings and transcript of testimony in the matter of the extradition of Fletcher Decker, now in his possession and on file before him as such Commissioner.</p>

<p>DATED this 31st day of August, 1921.</p>
