In the District Court of the Third Judicial District holding terms at Seattle, King
County, Washington Territory.

To the Hon. Roger S. Greene, Judge of the above entitled Court,

Your petitioner would respectfully represent that Gee Lee a Chinaman and a great number
of other Chinese persons, residents of the City of Seattle, being all such persons
who are passengers on board steamship "Queen of the Pacific" any more particular description
of whom, either by number, name or otherwise, it is impossible for your petitioner
to give, are now restrained of their liberty on board said steamship, lying at the
Ocean Dock at the city of Seattle,

That said Chinaman and others are restrained of their liberty by Malcolm McMillan;
James Rochester and John Alexander and others to your petitioner unknown, on board
said steamship. The cause of the restraint of said Chinaman and each of said Chinamen
aforesaid



is as your petitioner is informed, an unlawful attempt to compel said Chinamen to
leave the Territory of Washington against their will and consent and by intimidation
the said restraint is illegal in this that by force, threats and intimidation the
persons heretofore mentioned as restraining said Chinesemen and Gee Lee and under
said restraint are forcing said Chinesmen against their consent to leave the Territory
of Washington.

That your petitioner makes this petition and application of behalf of said Gee Lee
and seventy five other Chinamen, as their next friend and because they are prevented
from making this application themselves by the facts of the persons herebefore mentioned
as restraining them of their liberty.

Wherefore your petitioner prays for writ of Habeas Corpus for the relief herein prayed

Wan Lee
