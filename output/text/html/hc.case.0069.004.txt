D.L. McCowan being first duly sworn, deposes and says: That on the 28th day of Feb.
1884, in said city of Seattle said defendant did violate Ordinance No. 32 of said
city as follows, to-wit:

By being a person able to work and support himself in an honest and respectable calling,
not having the wherewith to maintain himself, who is found loitering and soliciting
about the streets of the city, who is an idle, dissolute person and has no regular
lawful business or occupation; who does lead an idle, immoral, profligate course of
life 

contrary to the term of the Statute said ordinance in such case made and provided,
and against the peace and dignity of said city. Wherefore depondent prays that said
Jack McLaine may be brought before this Court and be dealt with according to law.
