<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE 
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Petition 
of FRANCIS STEPHEN MEDCRAF for 
Writ of Habeas Corpus. 
No. 3038</p>

<p>BRIEF OF RESPONDENT, STATE OF WASHINGTON
ON MOTION TO QUASH WRIT.</p>

<ab>Alfred H. Lundin,

Attorneys for State of Washington</ab>

<p>IT IS WITHIN THE POLICE POWER OF A STATE TO FIX THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE SEEKNG TO PRACTICE DENTISTRY IN THE 
STATE.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Gray, in the well know case of Leisy v. 
Hardin (<del>1324</del> <add>135</add> U.S. 127), in speaking of the exercise of the 
police power, said:</p>
    <p>"It is that power which is characterized as that 
    inherent power essential to the very existence of civil 
    society, and the sageguard of the inhabitants of the 
    state against disorder, disease, poverty and crime.
        "The power of a state to make reasonable 
    provisions for determining the qualifications of those 
    engaging in the practice of medicine and punishing
    those who attempt to engage therein in defiance of 
    such statutory provisions is not open to question."</p>
<p>Justice Brown in Reetz v. Michigan, 188 U. S. 505,
citing</p>
    <p>Dent. v. W.Va., 129 U. S. 114-</p>
    <p>Hawker v. N.Y.,170, U. S. 189.</p>
    <p><add>Watson vs. Myd. 218 U.S.-173 -</add></p>
    <p><add>Collins vs Texas 223 U. S. 288 -</add></p>
<p>To quote from the opinion in the <del>latter</del> case: <add>g Hawks vs <unclear/> -</add></p>
    <p>"No precise limits have been placed upon the 
    police power of a state, and yet it is clear that
    legislation which simply defines the qualifications
    of one who attempts to practice medicine is a proper
    exercise of that power."</p>
<p>The issues raised in the case at bar are these: Do the 
statutes determining the qualification of those engaging in the 
practice of dentistry in this state create uniform and unreasonable
classes? So these statutes fail to apply equally to all
within the class created by them?</p>
<p>The State of Washington maintains:</p>
<p>1st. That the statutes in question are uniform as to all 
in like circumstances within the sphere of their operation.</p>
<p>2nd. That the classification is reasonable. Not such an 
arbitrary or hostile classification as infringes upon the quality
guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States.</p>
<fw>1</fw>
<pb/>
<p>3.</p>
<p>The statutes fixing the requirements for the practice of 
dentistry in this state apply to:</p>
    <p>"Any person or persons seeking to practice dentistry 
    in the state, or to (own), operate or cause to be 
    operated, etc., any dental office."</p>
<p>There is no restriction as to the operation,as the law applies
equally to any and all persons.</p>
<p>The provision exempting persons engaged in the practice 
at the time of the passage of the act applies equally to all who 
at the time were practicing, and is reasonable.</p>

    <p>State v. Vanderlins, 42 Minn. 129. <add>43 N.W. 789.</add></p>

    <p>Webster v. State Board, (K.Y.) 113 W S, W. 415.</p>
    <p>People v. Phippin, 70 Mich., 6. <add>37 N.  W. 888.</add></p>
    <p>Ex parte Spinney, 10 <add>N.W.</add> 323.</p>
    <p><add>State vs Randolph 31 Pac. 201 (Oregon).</add></p>
    <p>THE REQUIREMENT OF A DIPLOMA FROM A DENTAL COLLEGE IN 
    GOOD STANDING IS A REASONABLE REQUIREMENT.</p>
<p>The petition well may state that: "The Supreme Court
of the State of Washington has declared the said law herein 
quoted (R. &amp; B.Code, 8416-24) to be not violative of the State
or Federal Constitution."   In the short but well reasoned opinion
in "The Petition of E.G.Thompson for a Writ of Habeas Corpus",
(36 W. 377), the following appears:</p>
    <p>"If we are correct in our conclusion that the 
    legislature, in the exercise of its police power, has authority,
    under the state and federal constitutions, to regulate
    the practice of dentistry within the state by reasonable
    rules, it follows that the legislature may provide that
    an applicant be possessed of a diploma from some dental 
    college in good standing. There is nothing unreasonable
    in this requirement, nor in the other requirements named 
    in the act. Such diploma is evidence of the ability of 
    the applicant to practice dentistry. It is not conclusive 
    of such ability, and the dental board may, therefore, 
    provide reasonable rules for determining the actual ability
    of the applicant."</p>
    <p><add>2</add></p>
<p>We submit that petitioner's position that "unless this 
court defends and preserves his rights under the Constitution
of the United States, petitioner will be further restrained of 
his liberty, etc., pursuant to said void and unconstitutional 
law and in violation of the Constitution of the United States",
<fw>2</fw>
<pb/>
<fw>4.</fw>    
is untenable. The statement that the law is void and unconstitutionable
is a mere conclusion.   Petitioner speaks of his rights. What 
of the rights of the people of the State of Washington? Countless 
practitioners in the profession of dentistry have toiled through 
difficult and expensive college curricula in order to secure diplomas.
Petitioner seeks to be given the same privileges without the attendant
labor and expense.</p>
<p>The case of Webster v. State Bd. of Health of Kentucky (113
Sw., 415) is in point. That was a case in which mandamus was 
invoked to compel the State Board of Health to issue a certificate to 
practice medicine. The statutes of Kentucky authorized the Board
of Health to admit an applicant to examination for a certificate to 
practice upon his presenting a diploma from a reputable medical
college, or furnishing evidence that he was reputably and honorably 
engaged in the practice of medicine prior to February, 1884. The 
court denied the writ, holding that the requirement of a diploma
was reasonable.</p>
    <p>"The statute under consideration is a wise and 
    beneficient exercise of the police power of the 
    commonwealth, enacted for the purpose of protecting the 
    people of the state from imposition by expirics and 
    quacks."</p>
<p>We commend to the court's attention the case of State ex
rel Crandall v. McIntosh (Mo.) 103 SW., 1078, as being almost identical
with the case at bar.</p>
<p>Laws '05 Missouri declared that any person desiring to 
practice dentistry in the state, who shall have a license from the dental 
board of another state, or who should have received a diploma from 
a reputable dental college in any of the United States, should have 
the right to apply to the Missouri Dental Board for examination as
to proficiency, and to be licensed and registered. In a hearing on 
return of a writ to mandamus, the court held: That a citizen of 
Missouri never having been licensed by any dental board nor having
obtained a diploma from a dental college was not entitled to urge
<fw>3</fw>
<pb/>
<fw>5.</fw>
that such section was unconstituional as impairing the rights of 
citizens of the different states and foreign countries because
foreigners well equipped to practice dentistry in their country
coming into Missouri without a diploma or license from a dental 
board or graduates of dental colleges in the District of Columbia
and citizens of other States where no license was required, and who
were not college graduates, were not entitled to examination in 
Missouri.</p>
    <p>The Court in part said:</p>
    <p>"A certificate from the faculty of a college attesting
    that its bearer as a student, day in and day out, with 
    scholarly patience and research, had equipped himself with
    the technical knowledge taught in such college as contemplated
    by the foregoing statute, is of pronounced significance.
    It comes from the hands of honorable and competent men; it
    pledges the honor of the college that its holder attended
    lectures, possessed himself of the learning of his text books,
    passed his term and final examinations with credit under the 
    eyes of his perceptors, and was capable of rendering 
    professional services to the people in accordance with the rules of 
    his art; that he was, in the language of State ex rel Gregory,
    supra, no pretender, 'no empiric, mountebank, charlatan, or 
    quack'. It is manifest that no practicable examination by a 
    dental board could go quite so deep or be so searchingly 
    broad in its meaning as an honest,well - earned diploma of that
    sort. The law places its benediction on such a diploma, 
    assigning it no trifling office, and public sentiment tends to 
    support that theory." </p>

    <p>Harding v. People (Colo.) 15 Pac. 727.</p>
    <p><add>State vs Knowles 45 atl 877.</add></p>
<p>In the words of the court in State v. Creditor (44 Kan.
565, 21 Am. St. 306), <add>24 Pac 346</add> commenting on a statute providing that (1)
it should be unlawful for any person to practice dentistry without
having a diploma from a reputable medical college, and (2)
exempting from the requirement of a diploma those engaged in the 
practice of dentistry or dental surgery within the state at the 
time of the passage of the act:</p>
    <p>"if the regulations operate equally upon all who may
    desire to practice, and who possess the required qualifications,
    and if they are adapted to the legislative purpose
    of promoting the health and welfare of the people by 
    excluding them from the practice those who are ignorant and
    incapable, then the fact that the conditions mau be rigorous,
    impolitic and unjust will not render the legislation in-
<fw>4</fw>      
<pb/>    
<fw>6.</fw>    
    valid. The authorities uniformly support the exercise of this 
    power by the state, and statutes simlilar to the one under 
    consideration have been repeatedly sustained."</p>

    <p>State v. Med. Ex. Bd., 32 Minn., 324. <add>20 N.W. 238</add></p>
<p>The New Hampshire cases State v. Hinman and State v. Pennoyer
cited by petitioner are not in point and are no authority against the
validity of our statutes. The New Hampshire statute,held to be 
invalid in the Hinman case, was an act regulating the practice of 
dentistry. It required a dentist practicing in one part of the state
to undergo an examination and to pay a certain license fee, while
dentists residing elsewhere in the state were exempted from these
requirements. There was a discrimination between persons residing
and practicing in the state, founded solely upon the accidental 
circumstance of residence, or a change of residence, and for that 
reason the statute was held to be unconstitutional and void.</p>
<p>Although not specifically declared in the act, the manifest
purpose of the legislature was to exclude from a profession requiring
learning, skill and experience those who are unfit to practice, and 
thus protect the public from ignorance and incompetency. No arbitrary
or capricious conditions are imposed. The profession and practice
are open to any and all persons who are qualified and can produce a 
diploma as evidence of such qualification. The legislature was fit
to permit those practicing in the state when the act was passed and 
who are citizens of the state, to continue in practice without diploma 
or other evidence of competency. This fact is made by the 
legislature an evidence of skill and competency equivalent to a diploma
from a dental college, and the wisdom of either test we submit, is a 
question for the legislature. The act cannot be held to unduly 
<pb/>
<fw>7.</fw>    
discriminate between persons or classes and unconstitutional because 
it exempts those engaged in practice within the state when the law 
was enacted.</p>
<p>We ask that writ prayed for by the petitioner, Francis 
Stephen Medcraf, be denied.</p>
