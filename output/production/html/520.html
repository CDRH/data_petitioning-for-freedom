    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Blanche Barry was arrested and tried in a Police Court in Omaha on the charge of vagrancy and having a vanereal disease. This charge was successfully appealed on July 6, 1918, and an order of release was issued by Police Judge James M. Fitzgerald. Barry and attorney, John M Macfarland, filed for habeas against City Health Commissioner, Ernest T. Manning, charging that he continues to hold Barry in a detention home without complaint or judgement. The petition was granted, but later denied on July 12th. Barry motioned for a new trial, charging that such judgement was contrary to the evidence, but the motion was overruled on July 16th.</li>
