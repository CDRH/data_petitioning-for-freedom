    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In early 1916, Tom Birbilis, a twenty-eight-year-old Greek immigrant who had been living in the United States since he was a teenager, traveled from Iowa to Nebraska with nineteen-year-old Marie Campbell. Soon thereafter, the US Departments of Labor and Justice investigated him for violating the Mann Act. A district attorney accused Campbell of being a prostitute and Birbilis her pimp, but ultimately dismissed the suit. Campbell admitted that she had worked as a prostitute in Iowa, but had determined to leave that life behind when she agreed to travel to Nebraska with Birbilis, whom she had married. Nevertheless, U.S. immigration officials then decided to deport Birbilis for the alleged violation. Birbilis petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that he was being detained by inspector S. L. Whitfield and had not received a fair hearing. The U.S. District Court judge agreed, setting bail at $1,000 and ordering that Birbilis appear before him so that both he and the U.S. government could subpoena witnesses. Birbilis lost in Omaha but appealed the decision to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, which dismissed his case. It is unclear whether or not he was deported. 

It is worth noting the ethnic and gendered dynamics of this case. Birbilis' attorneys, for instance, wrote the following in a brief that survives in the case file: "The alien is a Greek. This American girl will perhaps make him a better citizen and herself a worthy companion for him. She is perhaps the highest type of American womanhood with whom this alien could expect to become associated in marriage. She was a fallen woman.&#x201D;</li>
