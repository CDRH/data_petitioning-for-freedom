<p>Recieved Jul 16 1920</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration Service</p>
<p>Seattle</p>

<p>U.S.Department of Labor.</p>

<p>In re case Hiura Teiichi,</p>
<p>Arrived July 1, 1920.</p>
<p>Ex. SS Africa Maru.</p>

<p>Brief on Appeal.</p>

<p>To the Honorable Secretary of Labor.</p>

<p>At the hearing before the Board of Special Inquiry, these facts in brief appeared:</p>

<p>That the appellant originally came to the United States as a stowaway April 1, 1914, on the SS Tacoma Maru; That he resided in Tacoma until October 16, 1919, when he made a visit to Japan as a member of a tourist party. The Board of Special Inquiry were of the opinion that the appellant was guilty of obtaining a passport under false pretenses, and also that he was liable to become a public charge. Upon the latter point absolutely no evidence was submitted. There is not a sylable in any of the testimony adduced to throw any light whatsoever upon the appellant's financial condition. His physical examination developed that he was all right, and the fact that appellant was able to support himself in Tacoma for a period of 5 1/2 years appears to conclude negatively any assertion of the Board of Special Inquiry that he is likely to become a public charge.</p>

<p>We assume from the history of the appellant that he is able to support and take care of himself.</p>

<p>As to the assertion by the Board of Special Inquiry that the appellant had been guilty of obtaining his passport by false pretenses, we desire to suggest that the passport is not the foundation of the appellant's right to be in the United States. The Government itself by its proceedings in all immigration cases acts upon the theory that the passport is not final and is not the source of the right of an alien to enter the United States. The rights of the alien must rest upon facts aliunde the passport, which facts are entirely independent of and distinct from the passport. The</p>

<pb/>

<p>rights of the appellant must be determined upon his status when he left the United States October 16, 1919. It is true that he came here as a stowaway in 1914, but his entry in the United States while illegal only continuted to be such and to affect his status for a limited period.</p>

<p>In Taylor v. U.S. 207 U.S.120, 52 L. ed. 130, The rule is laid down that the Immigration Laws are to be construed stictly. It is very true that during the period of the statute the appellant might have been arrested anywhere within the borders of the United States and deported to the country of his nativity. His status in the United States was then conditional.</p>

<p>Yamata vs. Fisher, 189 U.S.99 47 L. ed. 725.</p>

<p>To the same effect is U.S. vs. Nakashima, 160 Fed. 842. At the end of the period limited for deportation the appellant became a dom<del>o</del>iciled alien and entitled to all the rights of such an alien. The passport could never add to or take from his rights. It has always been held that a dom<del>o</del>iciled alien may visit the country of his nativity and return to the United States within the time limited by law and regulation.</p>

<p>See U.S. vs. Suekichi, 199 Fed. 751.</p>

<p>Any false statement which the appellant may have made to obtain his passport or any silence which he may have observed in order to obtain it cannot be considered or used in order to make out or sustain a charge of likelihood of becoming a public charge, when arrested afterwards.</p>

<p>U.S. vs. Martin 193 Fed. 795</p>

<p>It is respectfully submitted that the Board of Special Inquiry mistook its functions and ignored the laws and the facts in making its finding of entry by use of a passport obtained under false pretenses and of likelihood to become a public charge, and</p>

<pb/>

<p>that the order made by them should be reversed and the appellant permitted to enter the country.</p>

<p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>Agent for Applicant</p>
