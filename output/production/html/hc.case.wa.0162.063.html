      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington<br/>
County of Spokane} <br/>
In the District Court of the
4th Judicial district
holding terms at county
seat of Spokane County</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington<br/>
vs.<br/>
Ray Raymond Defendant</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington
County of Spokane W.T. Ray Raymond being first fuly
sworn on my oath state: I am defendant above
named and I am not guilty of the crime with which
I am charged in this indictment nor of any offense
therein contained against the laws of Washington
Territory. I believe I cannot have a fair trial of this
cause in the county of Spokane on account of and
owing to the prejudice and excitement against
me in and among the inhabitants of said County, and
I ask to be tried by disinterested triers. That
among the facts upon which such belief is 
founded I state the following:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have a number of bitter personal enemies
in the city of Spokane Falls in said County, whom
am informed and believe, and upon such information 
and belief allege have ever since I was
accused of this crime busied themselves
industriously circulating false statements
purporting to be the facts relating to this case
and also in circulating rumors and false

<span class="hr"> </span>

to the effect that I am a dangerous and quarrelsome
<del>attention</del> and given to the wanton and reckless
use of firearms, and so persistently has this
statement been made that many good people of the
county have come to believe it and to repeat it
as true; that many false and, malicious statements
and charges against this defendant have been
circulated among the inhabitants of said
county among which I am informed
and believe, and upon that information 
and belief alleges that since I was accused
 of the crime it has been circulated 
among and is generally believed by
the people of the county, that I had therefore
murdered my husband and had
killed two men &amp; one woman in
matters are of which are wholly false
but have tended greatly to excite and
prejudice the people of the court, against
me that many false and exagerated
and highly colored and prejudicial
account, purporting to be the facts
in this case have been invented
among the people of the county among
other false and untrue statements
purporting to be the facts in this case
circulated since I was accused of
this crime <del>was</del> is the following</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am informed and believe, and upon
such information and belief allege that
one George Ferster, who appearing as
a special prosecuter against me
at the hearing of the habeas corpus
application to admit me to bail
heard before this court about the
thing of such having stated
That the prosecution
had witnesses to prove that at the
time of the killing with which I am
charged the deceased was in the hallway of the
"Bay Window" house and near the door and that
two men had hold of him putting him
out and had <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> him to his knees
and had hold of him and that this
affiant came out of her room with
a loaded and cocked revolver and
said <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> him I'll fix him
and thrusting the revolver in his
throat fired the shot that killed him
applicant here states politely that such
statement of the facts in this and is
wholly untrue and alleges upon her information 
and belief that the prosecution never
at any time had any person who
could swear his was part of it
many thing resembling it applicant 
is further informed <span class="tei_add">and believes</span> that this story was circulated

<span class="hr"> </span>

among the people of this county until
many good people came to believe it
to be the true statement of facts in
the case, and am greatly prejudiced against
defendant by reason thereof that whether
or not said special prosecutor was 
employed against defendant volunteered
to prosecute her affiant does not know
but affiant has been informed and believes that
citizens of Spokane Falls attempted
to employ special council to assist in
her prosecution.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Applicant further states that during the time of the
preliminary hearing of this case before justices
Peel and Booge she heard many expressions
of bitter prejudice against her from
among the crowd of people in attendance
and heard the crowd stomp their feet
in approval of the final determination 
of such <del>hearing</del> justices in holding
defendant for murder in the first degree 
without bail and during said
hearing witnessed many strong
manifestations of prejudice and
excitement against her and
was became alarmed for her own
safety, applicant has heard and the affidavit
of her attorney Thomas C. Griffitts hearin and

<span class="hr"> </span>

knows many of the facts therin stated concerning
the occurances at the preliminary hearing
before said Justices of her own knowledge,
and concerning the publications in
the newspaper therin referred to
and knows such statement to be true
and she refuted said affidavit and
to the affidavit of her other comments
herein filed and to the other affidavit
filed in support of this motion force
were specific statement of the
facts and circumstances upon which she
bases her belief in the prejudice of the people –
I have stated the facts constituting my defenses
herin truly <del>and</del> fully to my council in this
cause and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">endorsed[?]</span> by them that I have a
good defense and one that can be made available
herein if I can have a fair trial; that this application 
is not made for delay but
in good faith and that Justice may be
done.</p>
