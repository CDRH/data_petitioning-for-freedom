    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Margaret Roy, a subject of Scotland, and her attorney, Ralph S. Pierce, filed the petition to challenge her detainment for the purpose of deportation by the United States immigration office for "being an alien and believed to advocate the overthrow of government, [and who] disbelieved in and who opposed organized government". 
The primary claim for her release was that her detainment was due to a failure to provide her due process. She claimed that her fifth amendment rights were violated. Her claim referred to the answers she provided to an immigration hearing after her arrest in July 1918 (warrant issued June 24) where she admitted that she was a member of the IWW and believed &#x201C;in mass action and organization,&#x201D; but denied taking any actual actions. Further, her petition claimed that the evidence against her was based solely on IWW literature that was not actually in her possession at her arrest. Further still, she claimed that the government refused to even turn over the transcript of the hearing or the evidence they attached to it to enable her defence.
The judge approved her writ and demanded that the US government appear to demonstrate its cause for holding her.
In February 1919, the government did appear and provide the transcript of the hearing and the evidence against Roy. The judge ruled that her detainment was lawful and could continue. Presumably, she was deported afterward, but there is no evidence to be certain.
In March 1919, the government of the United States requested that the previously introduced evidence of Roy's hearing and IWW literature be removed from the case file and letters signed by Roy's lawyer agree to that removal.</li>
