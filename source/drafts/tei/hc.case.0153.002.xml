<p>Territory of Washington
County of Spokane}ss
In the District Court
of the Fourth Judicial 
District holding terms
at Spokane Falls
Territory of Washington
vs.
Ray Raymond
I Stanley Mattll being duly
sworn on my oath depose
and say that I am now and
for the [ast nine years have
been a resident of the precinct of Medical Lake in
Spokane County Washington
Territory. That have casual 
knowledge that there
was such a case as that
above named ever since
the homicide out of which
it grew. That I am well
acquainted with the people
residing in said Medical
Lake precinct and have
personal acquaintance
with the greater part of
many. That I have opportunity
to hear the opinions and sentiments 
of the people of
said precinct expresses and
in a general way know the
same. That I have never
heard any expression of
hostility to or prejudice
against the said efendant
Ray Raymond of the resident
of said precinct. That if
there was prejudice and
ill will existing against
her there I should have
been most certain to
have heard it. That from
my best information the elleged 
facts relating to the
homicide out of which
said action drew are not
generally known to the
people of said precinct
and that they generally
have not formed an opinion 
as to the guilt or
innocence of said defendant
and that the people of said
precinct are not prejudiced
against said Ray Raymond
in said action.
Applicant further saith 
that there are about four
hundred people living in
said Medical Lake precinct
and that applicant verily
believes that a large number 
of hood unprejudiced
and loyally qualified jurors
can be summoned and
secured in said precinct
to serve as jurors in
said action and further
applicant saith not.
