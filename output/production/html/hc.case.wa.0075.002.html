      <p class="tei_p">WHEREAS, at a Justice's Court held at my office, in said County, for the trial of 
Lee Kee for the offense hereinafter stated, the said 
Lee Kee was convicted of having, on the 
21 day of May 1885 in said County and City committed the offense of
unlawfully keeping a house on Washington Street between 2nd &amp; 3rd Streets 
in said City of Seattle in which diverse persons did then and there 
smoke and inhale opium, contrary to the provisions of 
section 1 of ordinance No 618 of said City of Seattle
and upon conviction, the said court did adjudge and determine that said Lee Kee
should pay a fine of fifty Dollars 
and 20 70/100 Dollars cost, and stand committed until the same be paid;
and, whereas, the said Lee Kee has made default in the 
payment of the same. Therefore, you, the said Marshal or Police Officer, and said Keeper, are hereby commanded in 
name of the United States forthwith to convey and deliver the said Lee Kee
to the said keeper; and you, the said keeper, are hereby commanded to receive the said Lee
Kee into your custody in said jail, and him there keep at hard labor for the 
space of 30 days, unless said fine and costs be sooner paid, or he shall thence
