of in his testimony Heard <span class="tei_add">part of</span> the description
given by Dr Morgan giving the description
of the dead Man, there such a person 
called at my place, a little before 
11 PM night of 25th, He was in 
the house my front door was open 
and he walked in no one gave him 
permission when my front door is open 
the inside is shut He was quite 
happy from his manner He came 
in the front and opened my parlor 
door and I said how do you do
he said is my friend here I say 
says no there has been no one 
here he said my friend said 
he was coming here and I think 
he is here, no I told him no 
one was here he would know 
No strangers had been here he 
answered by saying you are a 
lying, Old Bitch I told him not 
to speak like that and he reached 
up his hands and said I have a 
notion to break your face

<span class="hr"> </span>

says no I wont treat if you'll 
treat I'll drink I asked him to 
sit down and if you will treat 
first then I will, I was there alone 
and a little araid of him</p>

      <p class="tei_p">He stepped past me to my dressing
room door and I turned round 
and said I don't want you to go 
in there, there is no one in there 
he reached out and took me 
by the arm and said I will 
go in there I'll kick the belly 
off you I reached my hand 
up to him and took hold of 
the little cord <span class="tei_add">on his shirt</span> and said dont 
be cross lets be friends he 
said no I want my friend</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I asked him who his friend 
was he said little fellow that 
came with him off the R.R. and 
described Johnny Maybiess saying 
he had reason to believe he was 
there because he had asked for 
Miss Zoe and was told she

<span class="hr"> </span>

got a 33 and heard Johny as 
looking for her he said my little
Miss told me <span class="tei_add">I</span> asked him to stay 
that may be his friend would 
come said no he would go 
and hunt him he stood while 
he was there would not sit down 
was quite intoxicated and reeling
when he went out he managed
to get into the dressing room then 
out into the hall and out I followed 
him to the hall door and then locked 
it, Had no hat on</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Cross</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I was talking about a man 
dont know his name, never saw 
him before, nor since, no I 
never heard his name dont 
presume to say he was the man 
did not see him after he was 
dead no one else heard this 
language I was alone I 
asked him to sit down done 
all I could to quiet him I asked 
him to treat to a glass beer

dont presume to say he was the 
Man is what I said, He came 
there asking for his friend and 
Called him Johny and described 
Johny Maybiess the reason I 
tought it was Maybiess was because 
he inquired for a little fellow 
that got acquainted with Zoe

house showed me a small square
piece of paper whch seemed to me
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> that looked like this, torn Across

worked hard in this country and got 
less ¢ on the dollar for his work</p>

killed beacuse I did not see him </p>
