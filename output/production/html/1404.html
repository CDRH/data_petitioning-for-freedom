    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Taik (Emma Hamilton) was a 13 year old Tlingit girl who was taken to the Sheldon Jackson Institute (aka Indian Training School at Sitka) in January of 1885 by Sheldon Jackson and Alonzo E. Austin. Taik's mother was said to have died around March 1885, and one Anna Vine became the parent- appointed guardian of the child. The story was that after the death of Hitch- sah- See, Taik's mother, Vine came in March 1885 to take Taik from the school to her home in Victoria, British Columbia, the school administrators, including Jackson and Austin refused to grant the release. When her complaints for release went unanswered, Hitch- sah- See filed for a writ of habeas corpus with her husband, Don- ah- Clah, against Jackson, Austin, and a woman referred to as "Mrs. McFarland." After the case was filed it was discovered that Taik's mother had not actually died, but was still alive, as was her father, Don-ah-clah. The case was transferred to them, and they became the new petitioners. The defendants argued that they had made a verbal agreement to enroll Taik for a period of 5 years in the school with her parents. With this alleged verbal agreement, the defendants claimed to be the legal guardians of Taik.  Judge Ward McAllister ruled against the defendant, in favor of Hitch- sah- see and Don-ah-clah. He wrote that the school officials had no authority to make "contracts with Indians" under the provisions of the federal government. Additionally, administrators could not take Native children from their parents, and were required to return them if that's what parents wished. </li>
