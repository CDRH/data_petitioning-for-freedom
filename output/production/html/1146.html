    <li>Summary of Proceedings: John Van Ormer, father and next friend of Rose Van Ormer, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus against his presumed wife or ex-wife Christina Van Ormer. Christina had divorced him on the allegations that he was an abusive alcoholic who failed to support his family. She had left with Rose for Colorado in 1889. She stayed there for about some time before returning to Omaha to live with her son from a previous marriage, Phillip Summerlad. In November 1889, John was convicted of assaulting Phillip, perhaps to regain control of Rose. He had also tried to kidnap Rose once before. The struggle became physical again on February 3, 1890, with Christina and John literally fighting over the child in the streets, pulling her between them. This was after John had tried to kidnap her, but Christina managed to regain the child. Rose clearly preferred Christina, and even claimed that her surname was Summerlad, not Van Ormer. Roughly two months later, the cause was dismissed by petitioner. According to an 1890 Lincoln Journal Star article, the custody of Rose was given to her mother in the divorce proceedings.</li>
