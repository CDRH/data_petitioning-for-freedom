    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Hannah Segerholm was the servant of Hannah and Per A. Anderson. While she was working for them, she had her daughter, Mabel. One witness alleged that Per A. Anderson was the father and another said that Nels Johnson was the father. Hannah Segerholm gave her daughter away to Melissa and Louis Potts to take care of her until she was an adult. She had been in their custody since she was 3 1/2 months old, although no official adoption papers were ever signed. Some witnesses said that Louis took Mabel in his covered wagon to Oklahoma and everyone was unable to find them. Because of this, Hannah Segerholm filed a writ that said she wanted child custody to be given back to Hannah Anderson. Then, this writ was filed with the Potts claiming the Andersons and Hannah Segerholm were unfit to care for Mabel. The battle in the courtroom got physical at points, according to the Evening World-Herald. The court decided that Mabel should stay with the Potts family. </li>
