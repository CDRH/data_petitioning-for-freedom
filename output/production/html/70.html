    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On September 15, 1918, Omaha's Health Commissioner authorized the isolation and quarantine of Maud Shaw under city Ordinance No. 9852, alleging that Shaw had been found with a venereal infection. On October 17, 1918, Jud Brown filed for habeas on behalf of Shaw against Manning and the superintendent of the detention home, Alva Burger. In the petition, Brown argued that Shaw had been confined for 4 weeks without any complaint and is free of any alleged disease. A writ was issued, but the case was later dismissed for want of prosecution on January 26, 1920; the fate of Shaw is unknown.</li>
