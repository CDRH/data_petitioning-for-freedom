    <li>Summary of Proceedings: James Nesladek and Anna Nesladek petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus against A. H. Vosberg (Chief of the Juvenile Department), Michael L. Clark (Sheriff) and Sherman Clayton (Chief Deputy Sheriff and Jailer) for detaining their son, William Nesladek. They stated that Nesladek was 17 years old and had not committed a crime. They claimed that they first learned that he was accused of a crime when they were served summons to appear before the Juvenile Court, which meant that Nesladek did not have counsel when he was tried in a trial without a jury. Therefore, they argued that he was convicted and sentenced to the state reformatory without due process of law. Judge Charles Goss commanded that Vosberg, Clark, and Clayton bring the body of Nesladek before the court, and Nesladek was released on recognizance of $1,000 with his parents are sureties while the trial was under advisement. The petition was granted and Nesladek was released from custody of the sheriff upon his sentencing to Kearney, but he was remanded to the custody of the juvenile court. It is unknown what Nesladek's ultimate fate was. </li>
