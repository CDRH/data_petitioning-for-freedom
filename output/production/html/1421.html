    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In October 1924, Harry Reed petitioned for a writ of Habeas Corpus on the grounds he was being unlawfully restrained of his liberty. Seven years prior, in 1917, a divorce was entered against the petitioner in favor of his former spouse, Chloe Reedy, in Atchison, Kansas. The court found Harry guilty of gross neglect and awarded Chloe custody of their two minor children and an alimony of $5 per week. In Douglas County, October 1924, Harry was arrested for non-support of his minor children and being a fugitive of justice from Kansas. The petition alleges Harry was not a fugitive of justice from Kansas and by decree of the divorce he was not guilty of any felonies. Judge Stauffer allowed the writ, and Harry Reedy was released from custody. </li>
