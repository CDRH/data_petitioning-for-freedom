    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On June 23, 1920, Nellie P. Christy, ne&#xE9; Crother, asked for a divorce from her husband of 15 years, Robert E. Christy. She accused him of committing repeated acts of adultery with their maid, Beulah Shepherd. Robert had become infatuated with the 17-year-old, and continually defied Nellie's attempts to fire her. He also refused to support his wife or their six children, so Nellie had been forced to take in roomers and work in a laundry. At some point, he had moved away from the family's home in Fullerton to live in Omaha with Beulah. The divorce was granted, and Nellie was given custody of the three older children, with Robert maintaining custody of the three younger. Robert continued coming around Nellie's household after the divorce to verbally abuse and swear at her, as evidenced by a restraining order issued against him in September 1920. Robert filed a petition for a writ of habeus corpus, presumably against Nellie, for his daughter, Ruth Christy on July 12, 1923. Apparently, sometime before 1923, custody of all six children had been given to Robert after Nellie was accused of living with another man. This did not dissuade Nellie from visiting her children, and she violated a court order to do so. She accused Robert of poisoning her children's minds against her, and said that the gifts of hand-knitted stockings that she had mailed to them were returned to sender. On January 21, 1924, the case was dismissed for want of prosecution. This may be because the Christy family was involved in another legal case at the time&#x2014;Ruth and Vera had danced in a public theater, which was illegal for girls under 14. Both had been sent to a reform school in Riverview on July 13, 1923. </li>
