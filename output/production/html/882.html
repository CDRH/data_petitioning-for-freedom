    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Don E. DeBow filed a petition for habeas corpus against Douglas County Sheriff and Jailer Michael L. Clark on September 25, 1917. His petition stated that, on September 19, 1917, DeBow had been arrested and charged with selling securities of an association called "The Farmers Oil &amp; Gas Company" without a permit from the Nebraska State Railway Commission, which allegedly violated Section 808 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska, otherwise known as the "Blue Sky Law." 

DeBow pled not guilty in an arraignment in front of Omaha Police Magistrate James M. Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald found probable cause, set DeBow's bail at $400.00, and directed a mittimus for Fitzgerald to Sheriff Clark on September 22, 1917. DeBow did not pay the bail and was taken into custody. DeBow's petition asserted that the process used to justify his detention was illegitimate. Judge Willis G. Sears allowed the writ to be issued and commanded that Clark appear with the body of DeBow and justify DeBow's detention on September 27, 1917. On October 2, 1917, after hearing the evidence, judge Willis G. Sears denied and dismissed DeBow's application, and it is likely that DeBow stayed in custody.</li>
