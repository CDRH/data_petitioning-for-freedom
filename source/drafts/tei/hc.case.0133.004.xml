<p>The Territory 
vs. 
S.P White } Charge = murder in second degree
The prisoner is charged in the 
indictment with the offence 
of murder in the seond degree,
committed by killing one <del>light</del>
alias Light Beardon in Lincoln
County in this territory.
That the deceased person named 
in the indictment was <del>killed 
shot by</del> murdered by a bullet 
fired from a pistol in the hands
of the defendant and that he died
from said wound a couple of days
thereafter, is not disputed by the
defense.
The defense maintains the position
that the fatal shot was fired by 
the prisoner in the necessary 
defense of his person. The law
decrees to all the right to use
deadly weapons to protect this person
from death or great bodily harm.
It is not every apprehended dan-
ger however that will justify a
killing in selfdefense. He must
be a serial danger <del>to the life</del> 
and one liekly in the apprehension
of a reasonable man, to 
result in loss of life or great bodily
injury. The danger must appear to be
imminent and innundated,
lest a contingent danger.
That he is owed not be real.
If the facts and <unclear></unclear>
were such as to indulge a reason-
able man to believe that is
actually existed.
A person, in no way in the wrong,
need not go out of his way to 
avoid danger, and being in a 
position adhere he has the right
to be, may stead on his rights
and rebel unlawful as soon
with such force as may be necessary.
even to the taking of human life,
if it be excused, to use so much
force to save his own life or to
save his person form great bodily 
harm.
A person, who by his own aggres-
sion, brings on a diffienly
does not plead in the acue
position. If he came he cannot
avoid a conflict, and if he
finds himself in danger and can
avoid it either by retreating or 
by calling for assistance, or by
yielding to a just demand upon
the part of the person or persons
attacking hum, and instead of
avoiding the danger acts is by
taking life, he is not justifies in the grounds of self defense.
But if a person in the wrong as I 
have stated, has avoided a 
conflict by using means in his 
power and still he finds him-
self in danger, of life or great bodily harm, 
and he can do nothing other
or further to save himself, then
he may use to his rights of
self defense, but with this 
indictment that he must 
not have put himself in da</p>
