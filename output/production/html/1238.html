    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 23, 1919, Agnes Marshall was arrested for vagrancy and prostitution. A few days later, on the 25th, police judge Charles E. Foster sentenced her to 30 days in the city jail and signed a mittimus requiring Marshall to be examined for venereal disease. Therefore, she was held by Elizabeth Hardy, keeper of a detention home, to be examined for venereal disease, although Marshall maintained that she didn't have venereal disease and there was no reason to suspect that she did. Another petition filed by her around the same time states that she refused to be examined unless her doctor was present, which the hospital didn't allow. Marshall attempted to post a bond for her release, but the court refused to allow it because of the aforementioned writ of mittimus. Therefore, on August 28, 1919, Marshall filed a writ of habeus corpus for her freedom against Elizabeth Hardy, arguing that she did not have the authority to detain her. An Omaha Bee article says that this petiton was filed along with similar petitions from other Detention Home inmates named Mamie Allen and Ruth Matthews. After hearings stretching into the first week of September, Marshall was released on a $500 bond. An answer and return was filed on September 9, and Douglas County paid the sheriff's fees for serving the writ of habeus copus on November 19. </li>
