to suit

Territory, at which place the Plff has continued to reside and at which county the
Defts then and now reside

forcibly and against the will of the Plff and against the will of his wife Maty took
and carried her from the house of the Plff to the house of the Defts in said County
where they have ever since forcibly and by threats of violence to her person restrained
him of her her liberty and will not permit the Plfft to speak to, nor see his said
wife

is  at the Plff but the Plaintiff says that he is informed and believes that his said
wife is very anxious to come to him and that the real reason why the Defts restrained
his said wife of her liberty is that the said William A Church may have an opportunity
to violate her chastity which he has attempted to do Wherefore the Plff prays that
a writ of Habeas corpus be issued forthwith and that the Defts be required to bring
into the court forwith the said Maty Wells that they may be dealt with according to
law and the said Maty set at liberty and for his costs and disbursement and for general
relif
