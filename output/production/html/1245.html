    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On June 9, 1919, Carson (Carlson) Titus was arrested upon a report that he had failed or provide for his wife, Emelia (Amelia) Titus. On June 10th, 1919 he appeared before a police judge where he pleaded not guilty and was placed on a $200 bail. On June 13th, 1919, he was arrested again under allegedly suspect pretenses. At that subsequent hearing, the bound party was ordered to pay Emilia $8 per week and was ordered to be imprisoned until he performed. On June 14th, 1919, a petition was filed on behalf of the bound party by his father, Frank Titus, who alleged that as a minor of 17 years of age, Carson was unable to marry and thus his marriage and any obligations to it are void. The application for the writ was granted on June 16th, but the fate of the fate of the bound party is unknown.</li>
