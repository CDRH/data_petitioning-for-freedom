    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In July 1922, 19-year-old Czech immigrant Henry Patera and Mary Poulicek met and started dating. A few months later, on December 6, 1922, he proposed to her with a diamond ring. This was against the wishes of his parents, Jacob and Agnes Patera, who promised to kill him if he married Mary. Thus, in January, he fled to San Francisco and joined the navy. Mary's father, James Poulicek, somehow found him and paid for his passage back to Nebraska to stand trial for the crime of seduction. On June 19, 1923, he stood on trial in the court of Charles A. Goss for parole in this offense, pleading guilty to the crime. Mary testified in this trial, and weeping, showed the jury her ring and proclaimed that she forgave Patera and still loved him. At this, Patera stopped the trial and proclaimed that he would marry Poulicek. The ceremony took place immediately in the courtroom: Judge Goss officiated, the bride and groom's lawyers formed the wedding party, and the jurors were witnesses. Goss ordered the couple to live apart from the parents and for Patera to compensate his new father-in-law for the travel costs of his return from California. After the ceremony, Henry kissed Mary and promised to be the "bestest husband ever." He would not keep this promise: on their wedding night, he refused to sleep in in the same bed as Poulicek and left her again only one day after they had been married. He was returned to Omaha shortly after and arrested for violating his parole on August 1, 1923. On August 7, Patera and his lawyer, Julius J. Zitnik, filed a petition for a writ of habeus corpus against sheriff Michael L. Endres and jailer Joe Sherry. Zitnik was also part of the Omaha Czech community. He claimed that since he had already been placed on probation, he could not be confined in jail. Judge Charles Leslie denied his petition on August 9, 1923, and Patera remained in the custody of the court. He was later sentenced to a reformatory for two years. On August 23, 1923, Mary had Henry Patera's daughter&#x2014;this means that she would have been heavily pregnant during the June 1919 courtroom wedding, a factor that likely encouraged Judge Goss to allow this unusual procedure. A few months later, in October 23, Mary sued Henry's parents, Jacob and Agnes Patera, for $15,000, claiming that their persecution of the couple had Henry's "loss of affection." Two years after Henry got out of prison, Henry married another Czech immigrant named Silvera. He worked as a laborer in a steel works to support his wife and daughter Silvia, born in 1928. Mary ended up marrying another man with the surname of Shada before her death in 1984. </li>
