<ab>STATE OF WASHINGTON.</ab>

<ab>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.</ab>

<ab>TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME, GREETING:</ab>

<p>WHEREAS, It has been represented to me by His Excellency
JOSEPH M. DEVINE, Governor of the State of No.Dakota that Solvest
A. Sylvester stands charged in said State with the crime of EMBEZZLEMENT
committed in the County of Traill in said State and is a fugitive
from the justice of said State and has taken refuge in the State of

<p>AND WHEREAS, the said Governor of the State of North Dakota has
pursuant to the constitution and laws of the United States demanded of
me that I cause the said Solfest A. Sylvester to be arrested and delivered 
to Stener S. Wenaas, agents authorized to receive him into their custody
and convey him back to said State of North Dakota.</p>

<p>AND WHEREAS, said representation and demand are accompanied by
affidavits, complaint, information, indictment and warrant whereby the
said Solfest A. Sylvester is charged with the said crime and being a
fugitive from the justice of said State and having taken refuge in the
State of Washington, which are certified by said Governor of North
Dakota to be duly authenticated.</p>

<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I , J.R. ROGERS, Governor of the State of Washington,

<ab>In re SALFEST A. SYLVESTER.</ab>

<ab>No. 3252</ab>
<ab>Filed June 20th, 1899.</ab>

<p>The appellant, Salfest A. Sylvester, sued out a writ of habeas
corpus in the superior court of King County, whereby he sought to be
discharged from the custody of Stener A. Wenaas. The cause and
pretense of his arrest and detention he alleged to be a warrant issued
by His Excellency, John R. Rogers, governor of the State of Washington,
without first having the Givernor of North Dakota certify that an
affidavit, if one has been made, stated a crime and was correct under
the laws of said state, and that no indictment or affidavit required
by law has been found or made in North Dakota. He further alleged that
his imprisonment and restraint were illegal because, first, the governor 
of North Dakota has not certified that a crime is charged second, that
no crime has been or is now charged or evidenced as is by law required,
and, third, that the governor's warrant does not state facts sufficient
to warrant petitioner's arrest and detention. The writ was duly served
the respondent who thereupon made return thereto that he was the duly
accredited agent of the State of North Dakota; that he denied that said
petitioner was or is unlawfully restrained of his liberty; admits that
the said petitioner is in the custody and control of the respondent;
that said custody is in all things legal and in accordance with the
constitution and laws of the United States, the states of North 
Dakota and Washington; that the respondent, as agent of the state
of North Dakota, holds the said petitioner is his custody under and by
virtue of a warrant for the arrest and extradition of said petitioner,
issued by His Excellency J. R. Rogers, governor of the state of Washington,
a copy of said warrant being hereto attached and made a part
of this return, the original neverthless being now and here produced in
court, upon the filing of this return the said petitioner moved the
court to require the respondent to incorporate into and make a part of 
his return the representation and demand of the executibe of North</p>

<pb/>

<p>Dakota alleged in the warrant as accompanied by affidavits, complaint, 
information, warrant and indictment, so that said return should set forth
the facts presented to the governor of the State of Washington upon
which he issued his warrant. This motion was denied by the court and the
appellant duly excepted to the ruling. Thereupon the appellant interposed
a demurrer to the return on the ground that the same did not
state facts sufficient to warrant a lawful imprisonment and detention
of the petitioner. The demurrer was overruled by the court, and an
exception taken; and the court thereupon dismissed the writ and entered 
an order fixing th bail of appellant in the sum of $500, and remanding
him to the custody of the sheriff of King County until said bail be
given, to be held by said sheriff at the expense of the state of North 
Dakota. From the judgment and orders of the court the petitioner
appeals.</p>

<p>The respondent moves to dismiss the appeal upon the following
grounds: I() a failure to serve and file briefs within the statutory
time; (2) a lack of diligence in the prosecution of the appeal, and (3)
that the order appealed from us not an appealable order and that the
court has no jursidiction to entertain the appeal. Under the circumstances
of this case we think there is no substantial merit in the first two
grounds of the motion, and in regard to the point that the order
remanding the appellant into custody is not appealable or subject to
review by this court, <del>and</del> the case of In re Foye and that of In re
Baker not yet reported establish the law of this state adversely to the
contention of the respondent. For the reasons given more at large
in those cases, the motion to dismiss is denied. </p>

<p>Following the rule laid down in the two cases above mentioned,
we next proceed to determine the merits of this case, or, in other 
words, to ascertain whether, in fact, the appellant is and was illegally
restrained of his liberty as alleged in his petition for the
writ of habeas corpus. In this instance, it will be borne in mind,
the papers accompanying the requisition of the governor of North
Dakota were not produced at the hearing before the superior court,</p>

<pb/>

<p>and we are therefore necessarily limited to a consideration of the 
return of the respondent to the writ; and the question is, does the
return, which is admitted to be true by appellant's demurrer, show
facts sufficient to autorize the arrest and extradition of the appellant
under article 4, section 2 of the constitution of the United 
States, and <unclear>symbol</unclear>5278 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, which
provisions constitute the law governing the subject of interstate
extradition. It seems to be the established law in this country that
the executive authority of a state upon whom a demand has been made by
the executive authority of another state for the rendition of a fugitive
from justice, cannot be coerced by the courts to produce or
exhibit the papers accompanying the requisition of the governor of the
demanding state.</p>

<ab>Church on Habeas Corpus, <unclear>symbol</unclear> 480;
People v. Donohue, 84 N.Y.438.</ab>

<p>And that being true, it would seem logically to follow that one
having the custody of an alleged fugitive from justice should not be
obliged, on a hearing upon habeas Corpus, to produce such papers. In
fact, this point was directly raised and passed upon adverse;y to the
contention of the appellant in the Matter of Leary, 10 Benedict, 197;
6 Abbott's New Cases, 44. See also People v<unclear></unclear> Donohue, 84 N.Y.438. The
executive warrant in this case recities:</p>

<p>"Whereas it has been represented to me by His Excellency, Joseph
M. Devine, Governor of the State of North Dakota, that Salfest A.
Sylvester stands charged in said state with the crime of embezzlement
committed in the county of Traill in said state, and is a fugitive
from the justice of said state and has taken refuge in the State of 
Washington;</p>

<p>And whereas, the said Governor of the State of North Dakota has,
pursuant to the constitution and laws of the United States demanded of
me that I cause the said Salfest A. Sylvester to be arrested and delivered
to Stener S. Wenaas, agents authorized to receive him into their
custody and convey him back to said state of North Dakota</p>

<p>And wgereasm said representation and demand are acomoanied by
affidavits, complain, information, indictment and warrant whereby
the said Salfest A. Sylvester is charged with the said crime and being
a fugitive from the justice of said state and having taken refuge in
the State of Washinton, which are certified by said Governor of
North Dakota to be duly authenticated.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, I, J. R. Rogers, Governor ofnthe State of Washington,
do hereby authorize and empower Stener S. Wenaasm the agent named
in said demand, to take the said Salfest A. Sylvester wherever he may
be found in this state, and transfer him to the line thereof at the
expense of the State of North Dakota.</p>

<p>And I hereby command all civil officers within said state of </p>

<pb/>

<p>Washington to afford all needful assistance for the execution of this 
warrant. * * *</p>

<p>This warrant, as we have before observed, was made a part of the
respondent's return to the writ, and appellant's demurrer admits the
truth of all of its material allegations, and, if it states all of the 
facts required by the constitution and laws of the United States to
authorize the arrest of a fugitive from justice, then the a rest and
detention complained os is not ellegal and appellant ought to be - 
remanded to the custody of the respondent to be transported to the
state of North Dakota to answer to the charge there preferred against 
him. An examination of this warrant will show a compliance with all the
conditions prescribed by <unclear>symbol</unclear> 5278 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States. It clearly recites a demand by the governor of the State of
North Dakota for the rendition of appellant as a fugitive from justice
from that state; that the demand was accompanied by the papers therein
specified; that it appears therefrom that appellant is charged in that
state with the crime of embezzlement and that the papers accompanying
the requisition were duly authenticated by the governor of the said
state of North Dakota. None of the recitals are controverted by the
appellant, and we think the warrant constitutes a sufficient authority
for the arrest and extradition of the appellant</p>

<p>The judgment and order of the lower court remanding the appellant
was, in our opinion, correct and proper, and it is therefore affirmed;
and it is ordered that the appellant be delivered to the respondent as
the agent of North Dakota when he shall appear, and that in the mean
time he be kept in the custody of the Sheriff of King County at the
expense of said state.</p>
