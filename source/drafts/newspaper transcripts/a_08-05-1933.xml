The Stroller

A TALE OF LONG AGO

Recently while in Portland, L.K. Hodges, editorial writer for the Oregonian and formerly employed on Seattle papers, told me a story. I have since checked upon it and obtained some additional data. Here it is:

It was mid-afternoon when George M. Horton, deputy coroner, called up Will H. Parry, city editor of the Post-Intelligencer, and told him that there had been a murder on Cedar Mountain, that he was about to start for the scene of the crime, and that Mr. Parry might send a reporter along if he cared to do so. But he would have to hurry. Horton&#8212;the same George Horton who afterwards became known as one of the most eminent surgeons on the Pacific Coast&#8212;and Sheriff Jim Woolery, were ready to start. Will Parry was the father of Tom Jones Parry. If you know Tom you know Will. That explains him. 

Parry looked around the office. He was stumped. The city room was empty. Or was it? There was a straw hat over by a corner desk, and by examining it carefully he found the youngest, and smallest, acquisition to the repeterial force in between the hat and the chair&#8212;Portus Baxter. Parry had met young Baxter at several baseball games, had talked to him, and had become so impressed with his knowledge of the game that he had employed him to write baseball for the P.-I. Up to the time of this story young Baxter had handled no other news.

The city editor told the cub reporter what was wanted and the cub reporter darned near fainted. In those days murders were few and far between. In those days murders were few and far between. Local news was scarce. A dog fight made the first page, provided that the owner of one of the dogs had a pedigree.

Baxter said he would not know how to write a story to go on the wire. Parry told him to do it just as if he was writing him a letter. Baxter siezed a ream of copy paper and a bunch of pencils and hot-footed it to the sheriff's office.
