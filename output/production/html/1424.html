    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On November 19, 1876, P. Bently accused William McCon of assaulting him with intent to kill. The next day, McCon was brought in front of a grand jury and justice and found guilty. Justice of the peace O.P. Lacy set bail at $1000. As he was unable to pay, he was confined to the Walla Walla County Jail until his next hearing in May. On January 31, 1877, McConn filed a writ of habeas corpus against Walla Walla county sheriff George F. Thomas, stating that his bond was unfairly high and he was unable to pay it. However, if it was reduced, he would happily pay it. Judge Samuel C. Wingard allowed the writ, but the outcome of the case is unknown.</li>
