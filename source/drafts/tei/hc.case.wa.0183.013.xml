sufficient to form a belief, and therefore denies the same.</p>
<p>III. 
As to the allegations set forth in the second paragraph,
he admits those ending at the words "which is unknown
to your petitioner", that he denies the reast of the allegation
in said paragraph.</p>
<p>IV.
As to allegations set forth in paragraph three, he
<pb/>
has not knowledgte and information thereof sufficient to form
a belief, and therefore denies the same.</p>

As to the allegations set forth in paragraph eight,
he denies each and every one thereof.</p>
<p>X.
As to the allegations set forth in paragraph nine, he
has not the record of the hearing in his possession, and is
therefore unable to say whether the statement as to the testimony
taken by the Government was correct or not; that if

arrival of the transcript it is incorrect, he will deny same;
that the transcript of the hearing will be marked "Exhibit A"

<p>XVI/
That wherever he has denied the statement as to what
testimony took place before the Commissioner, he will withdraw

hearings, it is shown that the petition for Habeas Corpus
correctly gives the testimony that was had before said
Commissioner.</p>
<p>And for a further and separate answer and return to
said application for a writ of habeas corpus, and for further
return to said writ, said Henry M. White alleges as
follows:</p>
<fw>(3)</fw>
<pb/>
<p>I. 
That a hearing was had before the Commissioner and
the petitioner was ordered deported, as is set forth in
paragraphs five and six. That after the decision of the 
Secretary of <del>Commerce and</del> Labor, he sent a warrant of deportation
from Washington, and the alien was delievered by
Inspector Watkins, of Portland, to the defendant answering
herein, for the purpose of deporting her.</p>
<p>II.
That the hearing was had according to the Deportation
Law of Feburary 20, 1907, and every right provided
for under this Act was given the petitioner.</p>
<p>III.
That though the evidnece as to the prostitution of
the petitioner might have been conflicting, there was
strong and substantial evidence showing that she was a
prostitute; that she should therefore be deported and
the petition ans writ herein be dismissed.</p>
<p>Wherefore said Henry M. White prays the above
entitled court that the said writ be dismissed and the application
and petition therefor be denied.</p>
