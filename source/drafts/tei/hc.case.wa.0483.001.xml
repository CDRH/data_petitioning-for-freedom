<p>In the United States District Court, in and for the Western
district of Washington, Northern Division.</p>

<p>In the matter of the Application
of Chin Hing, for a Writ of Habeas
Corpus.</p>

<p>No. 2857
Bill of Exeptions</p>

<p>Be it remembered, that on the twenty-ninth day of September,
1914, came John J. Sullivan, as Attorney for and in behalf of Chin
Hing, an alleged alien, and an alleged son of a merchant of New
York City, and appealed to the United States of America for a Writ
of Habeas Corpus, on the group of unlawful detention of said petitioner, 
and on the further group that one J. B. <unclear>Densimons</unclear>, Solicitor
of the Department of Labor, acted without authority in ordering the
deportation of said petitioner, and that in consequence he had been
deprived of a fair hearing, and that petitioner's appeal had been
heard and determined by one not authorized to do so; to show cause
an Order was issued from the United States District Court, In and 
For the Western District of Wasington, Northern Division, and in
due time the United States made a return from said order and Petition
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, admitting and denying the allegations
in said petition, and the United States further tendered and
made a part of said return, and alleged original record, marked
"Exhibit A", as taken before the Immigration Department. A stipulation
was entered into between counsel for the Government and counsel
for the petitioner to the effect that interrogatories might be
taken propounded to Louis F. Post, Assistant Secretary of Commerece
and Labor, and Corrie M. Stadden of Washington, District of Columbia,
before one Thomas G. Lewis, a Notary Public, which said interrogatories
listed information from said Louis F. Post, and said Corrie
M. Stadden as to whether or not said Louis F. Post was present in
the city of Washington on the date that said J.B. <unclear>Densimons</unclear> acted
and signed the Deportation Order, and reviewed the case of the said
<pb/>

petitioner, Chin Hing. The Order was signed by Honorable Jeremiah
Neterer, Judge in and for the Western District of Washington, 
Northern Division, and upon the refusal of Louis F. Post to answer
the interrogatories propounded by the said Commissioner appointed
by order of the Court, a rule to show cause was issued by Justice 
Gould in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and while
said matter was pending before said Court, counsel for the Government
petitioned Honorable Jeremiah Neterer to issue an Order withdrawing
said comission to take and propound interrogatories to 
said Louis F. Post. An answer was filed to said Petition by counsel 
for the petitioner, Chin Hing, and hearing was had, on which said
date the Court allowed the Government to make a further return, showing
that the Secretary had reviewed the record and affirmed the decision
of the Commissioner for the deportation of the petitioner, 
Chin Hing, and on the tenth day of May, 1915 the Court rendered an
Opinion granting the petition of the Government withdrawing said 
commission to take interrogatories, and on the twenty-ninth day of
May, 1915 the Court signed a Jedgement and Order in conformity with 
the said petition, discharging said Writ of Habeas Corpus, and remanding
the petitioner to the custody of the Commissioner of Immigration. 
to all of which the petitioner excepted as herin set forth,
Concel asked the Court to rule: </p>

<p>I.</p>
<p>That the so-called memorandum for the Secretary, or Assistant
Secretary, or Acting Secretary, as shown bythe record, was irregular,
illegal, and not given under oath, and its admission to the record
sent up to the Department of Commerce and Labor, constituted illegality,
and unfair hearing on appeal.</p>

<p>II.</p>
<p>That no other person except the Secretary of Commerce and 
Labor had a right to rule on appeal, as provided by the treaty,
<pb/>

laws and rules governing the admission of Chinese.</p>

<p>III.</p>
<p>That the petitioner had had no fair trial, in that letters,
memorandums, etc. from officials and inspectors of the Department
were considered by the Commissioner of Immigration without the
petitioner being given a right to deny the same, or being apprised
of their contents; that the same were not given under oath, and
were not evidence, being hearsay, and not permissable under the
rules governing the admission of Chinese.</p>

<p>IV.</p>
<p>That the evidence of so-called "Exhibit A" disclosed such 
irregularity and illegality that the Court should investigate the
record to do justice.</p>

<p>V.</p>
<p>That upon the evidence of this proceeding it appears from the
record that the petitioner did not have a fair hearing, as he was
entitled to upon application for admission into the United States
under the law, constitution and treaty and rules and regulations of 
the United States governing the admission of Chinese, and his detention
and deportation being illegal, he is now entitled to discharge.</p>
