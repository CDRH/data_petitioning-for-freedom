I went to the door there was a gentelman
standing in the hall when I went there 
I said Miss Ray there is a Man in the 
hall, she came to the door ordered
him out he refused to go out she 
ordered him out again he said 
he be D-D if he would she stepped 
back in her bed room just out of
the hall <del>but first he said he be d-d if 
he would</del> he struck at her 
when she ordered him out they 
wrestled a little bit she took him 
by the shoulder and ordered him 
out <span class="tei_add">again</span> he <span class="tei_add">refused to go</span>
         <del>said he be d-d if he
would</del> then she went in her bed 
room the bureau drawer

came back holding a revolver
by her side and ordered him 
out again he struck at her 
again and refused to go out

to get him to go out again she took
him by the shoulder again and 
tried to get him out again and 
he struck her some where about the 
shoulder think it was on the right shoulder 
she drew back pointed the pistol 
and it went off then the man stood
there he was shot I guess, he fell 
down in the hall it is a small 
hall and he fell between the two 
doors, Think she dropped the 
Revolver and went to helping 
the man and said O My God
have I shot you or hurt you 
and he said lay me down then 
she asked for water, a few minutes 
after that She helped to lay him down 
asked for water I did not get it 
for her and then the crowd 
gathered around I think she 
got water herself crowd was 
gathering in front dont know 
who was first there when the crowd 
first came she was ringing her
hands saying My God have 
I hurt you she usually kept 
her pistol on a empty chamber 
She did not khow it know it would 
go off and did not mean to shoot 
the man, <del>We lo</del> He was then

<span class="hr"> </span>

there in Hall and had left the 
door partly open when he came 
in she tried to take him by the 
shoulder and get him to go out 
She tried to get past him to go 
out and she could not as the hall 
was small and he would not let 
her pass when she could not get 
by the man she stepped back as 
I described before when she 
first came out she asked him
