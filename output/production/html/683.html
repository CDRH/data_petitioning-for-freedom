    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In December 1919, James Douglas petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds he was being unlawfully restrained of his liberty by Henry M. White, Commissioner of Immigration. Douglas was a citizen of Canada and was arrested and charged on account he was a person likely to become a public charge. At a hearing before the Department of Labor, Commissioner White issued an order directing Douglas to be deported from the United States. The petition alleged the evidence was insufficient, and Douglas did not violate the Immigration Act of Feb. 5th, 1917. Judge Neterer initially denied the petition, on account that the Court's jurisdiction was limited to determining whether a fair hearing was accorded, and the Immigration Acts makes the hearing before the Department of Labor Final. However, a couple days later, Judge Neterer dismissed the proceedings. The fate of James Douglas is unknown. </li>
