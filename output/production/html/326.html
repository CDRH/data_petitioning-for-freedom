    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Reigh Poole, the petitioner, petitioned for an absolute decree of divorce from his wife, Blanch Poole, through a writ of Habeas Corpus. Reigh Poole claimed that Blanch Poole had abandoned him, and he has since paid a reasonable sum to her for support. Yet, he was charged with wife abandonment and ordered to pay a sum of $5,000; he was incarcerated for his inability to pay the fine and, with his petition, asked to be freed from the burden and from unlawful imprisonment. The outcome was not provided. </li>
