      <p class="tei_p">The Petition of Adam Riley respectfully 
sheweth: That your Petitioner is a free 
man of color - born in Indianapolis state 
of Indiana - that he has been accustomed 
to run the river as fireman on steam boats 
between Cincinnati &amp; St Louis for the last 
three or four years - that he was arrested in 
this city on the 5th instant as a fugitive 
slave, taken before C. C. Simmons Recorder of 
the City of St Louis &amp; by him committed to the 
jail of St. Louis County kept by James Castello 
where your petitioner was confined and is 
now confined - that he is illegally imprisoned 
and unjustly restrained of  his liberty. That 
your petitioner demanded a copy of the commitment &amp; the evidence against him (if any) but 
was refused. Your Petitioner further states 
that none of his family as far as he can learn 
were ever held in slavery &amp; that no person 
claims your petitioner as a slave - that 
he can prove that he is free-. Your petitioner 
prays that a writ of Habeas Corpus may issue directed to the said James Castello commanding him 
to bring the body of your Petitioner before 
your Honor &amp; on its appearing that he is 
illegally held that your Petitioner may 
be set free.</p>
