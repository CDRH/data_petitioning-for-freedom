    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Alvira E. Britton claimed that while in the process of applying for a divorce from her former husband Robert I. Kendall in 1910, she gave over custody of her baby son Robert I. Kendall Jr. to Stephen W, Bryant and Alice Bryant. She was also about to undergo a life-saving surgery. After her divorce was granted, Alvira claimed to have tried to get her son back from the Bryants, but they refused to give him back. Alvira asserted that they neglected to send Robert to school or church consistently. Alvira got remarried to John Britton and felt that she was in a position where she could provide Robert with the proper care and wanted to regain custody of her son again. The writ was allowed and the judge decreed that custody of Robert would go back to Alvira. Robert Jr. apparently wanted to stay with his foster parents, who he had been with since infancy ,crying when he had to leave them.</li>
