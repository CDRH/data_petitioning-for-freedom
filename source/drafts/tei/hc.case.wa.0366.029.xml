<p>GOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN
DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</p>
<p>ADDRESS YOUR REPLY TO
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY-GENERAL
REGINA, SASK.
AND REFER TO OUR FILE NUMBER
DO NOT WRITE ABOUT MORE THAN 
ONE SUBJECT IN ANY LETTER</p>
<figure><p>stamp</p></figure>
<p>D/B</p>
<p>REFER TO FILE C 6506</p>
<p>REGINA, March 9th, 1922</p>
<p>Sirs:-</p>
<p>Rex v. Fletcher Decker.</p>
<p>I have the honour to acknowledge receipt
of your favour of the 27th ultimo requesting that I
give you some official statement showing that Fletcher
Decker against whom extradition proceedings were taken
at Seattle for his return to Canada for trial upon a
charge of theft of about three hundred bushels of flax,
the property of Claude Ficklin, alleged to have been
committed near Wiwa Hill Post-office, in the Province
of Saskatchewan, on or about the 15th day of November,
1915, has surrendered himself into the custody of the
Police Authorities of the Dominion of Canada.</p>
<p>I note that you refer to a letter which
you state you wrote to this Department on January
27th, 1922, to which you state you received no reply.
It appears also that you enclose a copy of a letter
dated February 20th, 1922, from the Deputy Minister
of Justice, Ottawa, Ontario, to whom you state you
wrote in the first instance, who it appears advised
you to communicate directly with me. It appears that
you desire the official statement above referred to
for the purpose of obtaining an order from the Court
at Seattle cancelling the bond which was given when
Fletcher Decker was released, pending the hearing of
his appeal.</p>
<p>In reply I have the honour to state that
the man</p>
<p>Messrs. Beeler and Sullivan
Lawyers, 
1807 L.C. Smith Building,
Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.</p>
<pb></pb>
<p>the man representing that he ws Fletcher Decker who
surrended himself to the Saskatchewan Provincial
Police on or about February 2nd, 1922, at the City of
Regina, has had a preliminary hearing at which he was
confronted by the witnesses for the prosecution who were
able to identify him, and after the evidence for the
prosecution had been given before the Magistrate he was
duly committed for trial, and I am informed that the
said accused is the Fletcher Decker against whom the ex-
tradition proceedings above referred to were instituted
by this Department.</p>
<p>With regard to the letter which you state
you wrote to this Department on January 27th, 1922, I 
may state that your letter of February 27th, 1922, is 
the first communication in this case which appears to
have been received from you in this Department, and
your previous letter does not appear to have been
received by this Department.</p>
<p>I have the honour to be,
Sirs, 
Your obedient servent,
<unclear></unclear>
Deputy Attorney-General.</p>
<p>Messrs. Beeler and Sullivan
Lawyers, 
1807 L.C. Smith Building,
Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.</p>
