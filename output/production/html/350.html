    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Nathan Finegold filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on December 28, 1923. On the same day, Judge Charles A. Goss issued an order commanding that Sheriff Michael L. Endres show cause for Finegold's detention. Endres submitted a response stating that in November, Finegold had been arrested due to a capias issued by Judge Carroll O. Stauffer for the charge of being in "contempt of court." This charge was connected to an accusation that Finegold had committed perjury as a plaintiff in a suit against the Union Outfitting Company and William Bell. Finegold was sent to the County Jail and was found to be sane in a medical examination by Dr. G. Alexander Young. On November 17th, 1923, the Court found him guilty of contempt of Court in connection with perjury and sentenced him to eight (8) months in prison. The judge for the habeas corpus petition dismissed Finegold's application without prejudice and it is likely that Finegold's detention continued.</li>
