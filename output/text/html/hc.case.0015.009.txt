Christian NH Hauemann a physician of the city of St Louis do hereby certify that I
have at diverse times and last on the day of Dec 1867 seen and examined Caroline Bauer
wife of John Bauer of the city and county of St Louis and believe said Caroline Bauer
to suffer of monomania and a proper patient to be sent to the State luncatic asylum
