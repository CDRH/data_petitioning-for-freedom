      <p class="tei_p">State of Missouri</p>
      <p class="tei_p">St Louis SS</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The petitioner Michael 
a boy of color having been this day 
brought before me the judge of the circuit 
court of St Louis county by writ of habeas 
corpus and the persons in whose possession 
the said Michael was found having 
refused to enter into <del>security</del> recognesance as required   
by law in that behalf. I do therefore order 
and direct the <del>said</del> sheriff of St Louis   
county to take possession of the said 
Michael and have him out from time 
to time during the pendency of the 
petitioners suit for freedom and that the 
sheriff take <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> from the person or persons who shall hire the said petitioner 
in the bond sum of six hundred dollars 
with such security as the sheriff shall approve <del>with security</del> that the said Michael   
shall at all times during the pendency 
of said suit have reasonable liberty of attending 

his counsel and the court and that 
the said Michael shall not be removed 
out of the jurisdiction of the circuit 
court of St Louis county or subjected to 
any cruelty because of his application 
for freedom and that the person or persons 
having said Michael shall pay the fine 
at the time stipulated and return the 
said Michael to said sheriff at 
the expiration of the term for which 
he is paid or sooner if the action shall 
sooner be obtained</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Given under my hand this 
30th May 1832</p>
