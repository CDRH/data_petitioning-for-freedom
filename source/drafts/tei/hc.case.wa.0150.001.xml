<p>That he is now imprisoned and restrained of his liberty by the

<ab>II.</ab>

<p>That the cause of pretense of the restraint of your said petitioner,
according to the best of the knowledge and belief of the petitioner,

petitioner was by the judgment of the said United States District Court.
in and for the District of Alaska, Second Division, sentenced to be confined
in the United States Penitentiary at McNeil's Island, in the State

were had and taken in said United States District Court, in and
for the District of Alaska, Second Division, upon the said judgment and

<pb/>

<p>a committment upon said judgment and sentence, a certified copy of which
committment is hereto annexed, marked "Exhibit B" and made a part hereof.
That thereafter such proceedings were had and taken in the said United 
States District Court, in and for the District of Alaska, Second Division,
that said petitioner prosecuted a writ of error from that said judgment
and sentence to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, in and for
the Ninth Circuit; that thereafter such proceedings were had and taken
in the said United States Circuit Court of Appeals that an application
was made for and on behalf of your said petitioner to have your said

cause of your said petitioner upon said writ of error in the said Circuit

Thousand Dollars, conditioned as aforesaid and to be approved as aforesaid;
<del>and</del> but your said petitioner alleges that by reason of his being without
friends and unacquainted in the State of Washington, he was unable to
furnish the said bond pending the determination of his said cause upon
said writ of error; that therafter such proceedings were had and taken
in the said United States Circuit Court of Appeals, upon said indictment,
and upon record in said cuase, that the said United States Circuit Court</p>

<pb/>
<p>of Appeals did on the 5th day of June, A.D., 1902, reverse the said
judgment and sentence and remand the said cause for a new trial; that
thereafter such proceedings were had and taken in the said cause upon
said indictment, that the said Circuit Court of Appeals issued a mandate
in said cause, a certified copy of which said mandate is hereto annexed,
marked "Exhibit C" and made a part hereof, which said mandate from the

certified copy of which said order is hereto annexed, marked "Exhibit E"
and made a part hereof.</p>

<ab>IV.</ab>

<p>That your said petitioner alleges that his said imprisonment
and restraint is illegal, and that said illegality consists in this;</p>

<p>A.-That the said judgment and sentence of the said United States
District Court, in and for this District of Alaska, Second Division,
having been reversed, and your said petitioner having been granted a new
trial by the said United States Circuit Court of Appeals, the said 
committment issued upon the said judgment is illegal, void and of no force
or effect, and in truth and fact your said petitioner is not confined or</p>

<pb/>

<p>imprisoned by the said Warden of the said United States Penitentiary at
McNeil's Island, under and by virtue of any legal or valid process, issued
on any final judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>B.-That your said petitioner has not been granted a speedy trial
upon said indictment, and is deprived of his liberty without due process
of law.</p>

<p>C.-That by reason of your said petitioner's illegal restraint and
confinement in said United States Penitentiary at McNeil's Island, in
the State of Washington, and without the jurisdiction of the said United
States District Court in and for the District of Alaska, Second Division,
your said petitioner has been denied and deprived of the right and opportunity
to procure bail upon said indictment.</p>

<p>D.-That under and according to the laws of the District of Alaska
now in force, the Sureties upon bail after indictment, are required to
qualify and justify before a magistrate of this District of Alaska, and
to make oath among other things that they are residents and inhabitants
of the district of Alaska; and your said petitioner alleges that he is
wholly unacquainted with any of the residents and inhabitants of Alaska
save and except those residing at Nome in the Second Division, District
of Alaska, and that he is without friends or acquaintances in the State
of Washington, and that navigation between McNeil's Island in the State
of Washington, where your said petitioner is now restrained of his
liberty, and Nome, in the district of Alaska, where your said petitioner
could obtain bail, is now closed, and owing to the close of navigation
and the lack of other means of transportation your said petitioner cannot
now be taken to Nome in the District of Alaska for trial upon said indictment
before the 15th day of June, 1903; that by reason of the aforesaid
facts, and by reason of the failure of the United States to comply
with the said mandate of the said Circuit Court of Appeals, and remand
your said petitioner to the said town of Nome in the Second Division,
District of Alaska, for a new trial, your said petitioner has been deprived
of the opportunity to obtain and has been and is unable to obtain
bail upon said indictment; that your said petitioner is in ill health and</p>

<pb/>

<p>unless he is granted his liberty and released from confinement, will be
in great danger of loosing his life.</p>

<p>Wherefor your said petitioner prays that a writ of habeas corpus may be granted, directed to the
said Warden of the United States
Pentientiary at McNeil's Island, in the State of Washington, commending
him to have the body of your said petitioner before this Honorable Court
at the time and place therein to be specified, to do and receive what
shall then and there be considered by your Honor concerning him, together
with the time and cause of his detention, and the said writ; and that 
your said petitioner may be restored to his liberty and discharged from
custody.</p>
