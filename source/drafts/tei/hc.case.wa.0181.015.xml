<p>STATE OF WASHINGTON
COUNTY OF KING ))) SS:</p>
<p>Bhagat Singh, being first duly sworn, deposes
and says; that he was employed as a government immigration
interpreter at Manila by the examination officials
to interperate at the time when more than half of the
seventy-three aliens who are now detained and whose cases
are before the Federal Court were examined, and he knows
that these men were properly examined by the immigration 
officers and given the same examination as is given 
at the ports of the United States proper and at
Seattle and he knows that they came into Manila in a
lawful manner and were held at the border for examination 
and were duly examined by the government and were passed 
and permitted to land at Manila and were given certificates
similar to certificate "A" attached to the
other affidavit, showing their lawful admission and their
proper examination and the fact that they had passed
said examination to the satisfaction of the government's
immigration inspectors, and this affiant attaches hereto
letters from the acting chief of the immigration division 
and two different inspectors of immigration at Manila, 
showing that he did serve as said interpreter and showing
that he is qualified to testify as to the proper admission 
of all of those detained who had been in Manila 
for a period of less than one year. This affiant also 
knows from his familiarity with the seventy-three
Hindoos and from his education and his ability to both
<pb></pb>
understand the government requirements and to talk ot 
his countrymen that the seventy-three men detained are 
all in the same position to the half of the men for
whom he interpreted as a representative of the government. 
This affiant further knows that it is the custom 
of the government inspectors in examining both at 
Manila and Seattle, to examin the passports and certificates
which all of these seventy-three men held and their 
other papers and after examination and surrender to the
government by the aliens of said papers, that the government
makes it a practice to return these papers to 
the alien for the reason that they would be too bulky 
and would take up to much file space.</p>
<p>Bhagat Singh</p> 
<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 27th day of August,
1913.</p>
