    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On April 26, 1922, George Painter filed for habeas against sheriff, Michael Clark. In the petition, Painter explained that his arrest came of April 17 in Sarpy County, Nebraska, after violating Section 16, Chapter 186, Laws of Nebraska 1917 as amended by Section 16, Chapter 156, Laws of Nebraska, 1921 (Section Laws 1921, Page 639). Painter was sentenced to a $500, costs, and 30 days. Painter argued that such confinement was unconstitutional and that the law was designed to deprive petitioner of due process. In addition, Painter argued that he had not been informed or arraigned for this charge, that as an uneducated man, Painter had no knowledge of law or legal proceedings, was not provided presentation, and agreed to plead guilty to pretend charges. The case was dismissed for want of prosecution on January 21, 1924.</li>
