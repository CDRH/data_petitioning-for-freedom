<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, IN AND FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT
OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
vs.
YO YOU JAM,
Defendant.} No. 3395
PETITION</p>
<p>Comes now JOHN J. SULLIVAN, as attorney for and in behalf
of Yo You Jam, an alleged citizen of the United States and an 
alleged son of Yo Bing Goe, a citizen of the United States and
resident of New York City, New York, and respectfully makes this
application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus and alleges as follows:</p>
<p>That Yo You Jam is imprisoned and restrained of his liberty
by the United States Commissioner of Immigration, Henry M. White,
and the United States Chinese Inspector, Henry Monroe, or by person
or persons acting by, through or under them, and that said Yo You 
Jam has been detained at the Detention office the Immigration
Station inn the City of Seattle, under the charge that the said Yo
You Jam has no lawful right to be admitted into the United States,
and that he should be deported according to law.</p>
<p>And your petitioner further informs the Honorable Court
that saud imprisonment, confinement and restraint and Order of 
Deportation is illegal, and arises from the following facts, to wit:
That said Yo You Jam arrived at the port of Seattle on a voyage
from China on the steamship "Ixion" on May 4, 1916; that said
Yo You Jam was given a hearing and was denied admittance into the
United States on the ground that he was not legally entitled to be
admitted therein; that an appeal was given by the said Yo You Jam,
through his attorney, James V. Storey of New York City, to the <pb/>
Secretary of Labor, and that on July 24, 1916, the said Order of
Deportation and said Finding of Commissioner of Immigration of
Seattle, Washington, was affirmed and said Yo You Jam was ordered
deported.</p>
<p>Your peritioner further alleges that said Order on Appeal
and said Order of Deportation is null and void, and that the said 
Yo You Jam has been denied the right to have his appeal heard by
the Secretary of Labor, as by statute made and provided in such
cases; that your petitioner has not had a fair hearing, in that
it appears in the record that the petitioner was entitled to be
admitted into the United States under the law and the Constitution
of the United States, and to deny him admission was a deprivation
of his constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further alleges that said hearing given
by the Immigration officials on appeal was unfair, and that said officials
were arbitrary and abused the powers given them under the law,
and that by reason thereof, your said petitioner has been denied
his rights allowed by law and by the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further alleges that he has not had a fair
trial in that letters, merorandums, etc., from officials and inspectors,
of the Department were considered by the Commissioner of Immigration 
and by the Secretary of Labor, or his assistants, without
the petitioner beign given a right to deny the same, or being apprised
of their contents; that the same were not given under oath,
and were not evidence, being hearsay, and not permissible under the
rules governing the admission of Chinese, and that the receiving
of the same by the said officials was a ursurpation of their power
and a violation of the rights of your petitioner under the law;
that the father of your petitioner Yo Bing Goe has been adjudicated to be an
American citizen and that your petitioner as the son of said Yo
Bing Goe is an American citizen himself, and being so has the<pb/>
right of entry into the united States as an American citizen, and 
that the evidence presented by said Yo You Jam presents a prima 
facie case and a proof of his citizenship; that the United States
Immigration officials have not offered any proof to contradict
said showing of citizenship, and that, therefore, the denial of the
right of entry of your petitioner deprives him of his constitutional
rights and is contrary to law.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further alleges that the entire record,
which your petitioner asks to be made a part of this petitition or
Writ of Habeas Corpus, discloses such irregularity and illegality
that this Honorable Court should investigate the record to do
justice to an American citizen.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further states that he has deposited the
sum of One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars with the Commissioner of Immigration
to pay for his board and lodging pending the final determination
of this case.</p>
<p>Your petitioner prays that he be allowed to go forth on 
bail fixed by this Honorable Court, pending the final determination
of this case adjudicating his rights.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, your petitioner prays that his Court find
that he has not been accorded the rights and privileges allowed by 
the Constitution of the united States and by the Chinese Exclusion
Laws and rules and regulations pertaining thereto, and that he be
discharged and allowed to join his father who is a citizen of the 
United States living in New York City.</p>
<p>Dated this 4th day of August, 1916.
By Yo You Jam
John Sullivan
Attorney for Petitioner
