<p>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, IN AND FOR THE WESTERN 
DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application 
of CHIN QUOCK WAH, for a Writ of 
Habeas Corpus. )
NO. 2971.
BILL OF EXCEPTIONS.</p>

<p>BE IT REMEMBERED, that on the fourth day of March, 1915
came CHIN QUOCK WAH, a Chinaman, and alleged son of a Chinese 
merchant, and an alleged son of a citizen of the United States, and 
appealed to the United States of America for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, 
on the ground of unlawful detention of said petitioner; to show 
cause an Order was issued from the United States District Court, 
In and for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division, 
and in due time the United States made a return from said Order and 
Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, admitting and denying the 
allegations in the said Petition, and the United States further 
tendered and made a part of said return, the original record marked 
"Exhibit A", as taken before the Immigration Department. The said 
cause was continued from time to time, and a hearing was had, and 
upon the tenth day of May, 1915 the Court rendered an Opinion, and 
on the twenty-ninth day of May, 1915 the Court signed a judgment 
and order in conformity with the said Opinion, discharging said Writ
of Habeas Corpus, and remanding the petitioner to the custody of the 
Commissioner of Immigration. To all of which the petitioner excepted, 
as herein set forth. Counsel asked the Court to rule:</p>
<p>I. 
That the so-called memorandum for the Secretary, or Assistant 
Secretary, or Acting Secretary, as shown by the record, was irregular, 
illegal and not given under oath, and its admission to the record 
sent up to the Department of Commerce and Labor, constituted 
illegality, and unfair hearing on appeal.</p>
<fw>-1-</fw>
<pb/>
<p>II.
That no other person except the Secretary of Commerce and 
Labor has a right to rule on appeal, as provided by the treaty,
laws and rules governing the admission of Chinese.</p>
<p>III. 
That the petitioner had had no fair trial, in that letters, 
memorandums, etc. from officials and inspectors of the Department
were considered by the Commissioner of Immigration without the 
petitioner being given a right to deny the same, or being apprised
of their contents; that the same were not given under oath, and 
were not evidence, being hearsay, and not permissable under the 
rules governing the admission of Chinese.</p>
<p>IV.
That the evidence of so-called "Exhibit A" disclosed
such irregularity and illegality that the Court should investigate
the record to do justice.</p>
<p>V. 
That upon the evidence of this proceeding it appears from 
the record that the petitioner did not have a fair hearing, as he 
was entitled to upon application for admission into the United 
States under the law, constitution and treaty and rules and 
regulations of the United States governing the admission of Chinese, and 
his detention and deportation being illegal, he is now entitled to 
discharge.</p>
<p>VI.
Counsel asked the Court to rule that the status of CHIN 
WING HIN, the alleged father of the petitioner as a citizen of the 
United States, was determined by the McGettrick Certificate, issued 
on the ninth day of July, 1896, introduced and made an exhibit and 
part of the record in this case, but the Court refused so to rule.</p>
<fw>-2-</fw>
<pb/>
<p>VII.
Counsel asked the Court to rule that further status of said 
CHIN WING HIN, alleged father of petitioner, as a citizen and as a 
merchant, was determined on a trip to China by an examination held
prior thereto in 1912, and a return on an examination made in the 
month of January, or thereabouts, 1914, from said voyage from China, 
but the Court refused so to rule.</p>
<p>VIII.
Counsel asked the Court to rule that there was no evidence
to justify the refusing of the United States, through its officials, 
to admit the petitioner from entering the United States, and no
evidence to warrant finding that he was not the son of CHIN WING HIN, 
but the Court refused so to rule.</p>
<p>IX.
That upon the law and the evidence the petitioner is illegally 
restrained and detained, and was not given a fair hearing, and is a 
minor son of a citizen of the United States, whose status had been 
adjudicated on three prior occasions, and ought to be discharged from 
custody, but the Court refused so to rule; and ordered that the Writ 
of Habeas Corpus heretofore issued, be discharged, and that said 
petitioner, CHIN QUOCK WAH, be remanded to the custody of the 
Commissioner of Immigration; and to said rulings and refusal to rule, 
and to said Order and Judgment of the Court, counsel for petitioner
duly excepted, and said exceptions were allowed by the Court;
the Court having filed an Opinion, which is included in the 
transcript of the record in this case, and is made a part thereof. 
The petitioner later appealed from said decision and order of the
Court entered on the twenty-ninth day of May, 1915, to the Supreme 
Court of the United States, and filed a petition for appeal adn 
Assignment of Errors, and said appeal was allowed, and Citation 
issued, as appears by the record.</p>
<fw>-3-</fw>
<pb/>
<p>Thereupon, petitioner, CHIN QUOCK WAH tenders this his 
Bill of Exceptions to the actions, rulings and judgment of the 
Court, and the refusals to rule in the particulars set out, to 
have the same force and effect as if each and every said exception
had been separately signed and sealed, which were signed and made 
a part of the record in this case.</p>
