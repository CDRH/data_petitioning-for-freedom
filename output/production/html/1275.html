    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In 1886 Can- ah- couqua filed for a writ of habeas corpus to regain custody of her son who had been at the Indian Training School at Sitka, AK for three years without leave. The defendants argued that Can-ah-couqua had signed an agreement with the school in 1883-when her son was five years old- to relinquish her parental custody for a period of five years. They argued that it was for the well being and education of the boy, Con-ca-bach, that he remain in the school and not be allowed to return to his "uncivilized" mother. Can-ah-couqua argued that she had never been presented any sort of contract or verbally agreed to give- up custody of her son to the school. She further asserted that Con-ca-dach was suffering physically from the poor conditions of the school building, overworked, and unfed. He was also frequent physically and verbally abused by teachers and other staff members of the school. Furthermore, she had not been able to see her son in three years, since he had been taken from her. As part of the petitioner's evidence, Can-ah-couqua;'s attorney submitted a letter that had been written by Con-ca-dach to the governor of Alaska, A. P. Swineford, saying that he wished to be taken out of the school, and returned to his mother. Judge Dawson ruled in favor of the defendants, writing that Can-ah-couqua had relinquished custody for five years in her "agreement" with the school, and it was in the best interest of the child to continue to receive a proper education. Can-ah-couqua was, however, allowed to occasionally visit Con-ca-dach at the school, provided that the there was adequate supervisor by school officials. </li>
