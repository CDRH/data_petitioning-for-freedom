    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Alice Bigelow's twin daughters Edith and Edna were placed in the Home of the Good Shepherd under two conditions: 1) they would only be there for six months and she could remove them whenever she wanted, and 2)they would not be taught the Catholic religion. Alice's daughters were there for one year and three months and she was only allowed to see them through bars under the supervision of a woman referred to as "Mother Superior." They were also taught Catholic practices which Alice believed affected them mentally and physically. She refers to them as being "regular prisoners in fact." On March 22, 1899, Alice petitioned to get her children back and was granted custody on that same day. </li>
