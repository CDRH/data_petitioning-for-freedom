this action in support of
said defendants motion for a 
continuance therein, and
know the contents of said
affidavits.</p>

<p>That I was present
at the house of said

the city of Spokane Falls in
said county on or about
the 25th day of June 1886,

of James Finch and witnessed
the transaction. That I now

That he then and there
informed said Griffitts

to said T.C. Griffitts
during the past week

that said Griffitts and
