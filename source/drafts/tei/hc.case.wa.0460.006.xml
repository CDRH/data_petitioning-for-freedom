<p>IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, FOR THE DISTRICT OF 
WASHINGTON, WESTERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>United States of America,
Plaintiff,
vs
Moye Chung, 
Defendant.</p>

<p>State of Washington,
County of Pierce.</p>

<p>:ss.</p>

<p>A. J. Smith being first duly sworn on his oath deposes
and says:-</p>

<p>That he is and has been for six years last past and citizen 
and resident of the City of Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon,
and has been in business in said city during said time as numbers
215 Front Street and189 Second Street respectively, and while de-
ponent has been engaged in carrying on said business, has not been
more than from one and one-half to two blocks from the places of
business of Moy Chung and Wah Ni and knows the said Moye Chong to
be a member of the firm of On Chong Wa &amp; Co., dealers in Chinese
dry goods and general merchandise at No. 140 Second Street; that
he is well and personally acquainted with the said Moye Chong and
has been for four lears last past; that he has seen the certifi-
cate with the photograph attached thereto as signed by J. E. Marks
Notary Public on the 10th day of March, 1892 and has read the same
and that the same is true with the exception that the said firm's
name should be On Chong Wa &amp; Co., instead of Won Chem Wo Co.,
which is evidently a mistake in spelling the firm's name, because
the firm at 140 Second Street is On Chung Wa &amp; co., and deponent
verily believes that owing to said mistake in the description of
said firm name, it has been the cause and source of part of the
difficulty experienced by said Moye Chong in obtaining admission
into the United States; and deponent further says that he has seen
the photograph of said Moye Chong and has also seen andtalked
with the said Moye Chong and knows him personally and taht the</p>

<pb/>

<p>said Moye Chong can converse quite fair and intelligently in the
English language, and also has seen <del>hi</del> the said Moye Chung since
his arrival at Tacoma, Washington, and that he was fully recog-
nized by the said Moye Chung; and deponent recognized said Moye
Chung as being the identical person as the said photograph as at-
tached as exhibit "A" and the identical person referred to in the
certificate and member of the firm doing business at 140 Second
Street; and deponent further says that he verily believes that
said Moye Chung is a member of said firm of On Chong Wa &amp; Co., as
deponent has done business with said firm, and that the said Moye
Chung when he left the United States about one year ago, sill had
and retained his interest in the business at said 140 Second St.,
and has and retains the same, and believes him to be a good, honest
upright Chinaman and acting in the best of good faith, and is a
bona fide Chinese merchant at Portland, Oregon.</p>
