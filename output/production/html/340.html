    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On September 25, 1900, Lillie Parker accused John Walker of bastardy in Cass County, Nebraska. Walker was arrested, arraigned in state district court, and ordered to pay a $500 recognizance, but fled to Iowa before doing so. Since bastardy was not an extraditable offense, the court found Walker guilty of bastardy in absentia and ordered him to compensate Lillie, whose child had not survived infancy. Walker was then accused of subornation of perjury, which was an extraditable offense, and returned to Nebraska. He was arrested and released on bail a few times before ultimately being jailed for failure to pay Parker. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, which was granted. After hearing the evidence, his cause was dismissed without prejudice, as he had not exhausted all his remedies in state court, and he remained in custody.

It is worth noting that Judge William Munger commented directly on habeas corpus law in his opinion, saying: "It is a fundamental rule that a court will not, by proceedings in habeas corpus, review the errors of another tribunal. It is only upon the theory that the judgment, the basis of the imprisonment, is void." </li>
