    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In March 1918, Alson Cole pled guilty to murder in the district court of Howard County, Nebraska and was sentenced to death. In January 1920, he unsuccessfully petitioned for habeas relief in federal court. In August, he petitioned a second time, arguing that he had not pled guilty to murder in the first degree--which is how he was sentenced--and that the trial court had never had a hearing to determine the degree of his guilt. The judge agreed with him and in October that the Howard County district court re-sentence him. In December, the court issued a nunc pro tunc order establishing that they had found Cole guilty of first-degree murder in 1918 but had neglected to record this fact in the trial docket. They once again remanded him to the custody of the warden of the Nebraska State Penitentiary to await his execution. Cole petitioned a third time in federal court for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the nunc pro tunc order did not remedy the defects in his trial. The court disagreed and denied his petition without a hearing on December 20, 1920. Newspaper reporting reveals that the state of Nebraska executed Alson Cole later that day.</li>
