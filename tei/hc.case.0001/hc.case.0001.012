<p>Dr. LP Walterhouse sworn and testified</p>
<p>Lin at Deep Creek Falls am physician and surgeon   knew Frank Teller he is now dead <del></del> saw him in death May 31th Tuesday in the evening house in the yard in front of his house substantially the Diagrams shown me is correct if any difference he was not lying quite as straight as shown - about 25 to 30 feet from door to gate about halfway between head to gate - feet 6 or 7 feet from front door might have been seen  did not look about the premises much  lying partly in the right side left side of face turned up  <unclear>considerable</unclear> blood about the head and face and in the ground about the body   saw gun double barrell shot gun  Just looked at it both hammers up - Caps on - saw sprinkles of blood in the barrell - from about where the <unclear>back</unclear> to the muzzle looked like it had been touched with bloody hands and other part looked like it had been sprinkled saw a board about 1 x 4 inches  3 1/2 ft long lying near the gun shown diagram board near the house

<pb facs="hc.case.0001.012.002"/>

it was considerably bloody on the side from 6 to 8 inches near one edge in patches as though forced in to the <unclear></unclear> about 1 in wide and foot long and as the other side some blood did not notice anything but blood in it one spot blood in ground say 1/2 <unclear>pinch</unclear> <unclear>poured </unclear> in would make it two other smaller <unclear></unclear> <unclear>me</unclear> near the door step - could not tell around how long there from appearance could not have been there near set <unclear>hour</unclear> was there next morning <unclear></unclear> same as night before deceased had <unclear></unclear> been <unclear>disturbed</unclear> gun and board <unclear>the same</unclear> blood spots there. <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> John Haynes and Rudolph Staltz I think was there <unclear></unclear> <unclear>Major Thompson</unclear> was there - I was ordered to make an examination by coroner  Done to - the coroner and I was <sic>engadged</sic> together we both took hold of him and rolled him over on his back then we <unclear></unclear> to get clothes I got knife and coroner cut the clothing in front and stripped him <unclear></unclear> <del></del> In was a mark about two inches below the left nipple ran <unclear></unclear> me <unclear></unclear> from round bruise simply destroying the testicle such as I have seen frequently made by a spent 

<pb facs="hc.case.0001.012.003"/>

bullet say 3/4 of in  such of a reddish brown color  I did not examine the clothing there was another mark about <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> of the other in the shoulder just below the collar bone almost like the <unclear></unclear> I examined his mouth and throat  on the throat large patches of blood <unclear>settled</unclear> <unclear></unclear> the skin extended about half way in color dark similar to clodded blood just such marks as in often seen on dead people when blood settles under the skin   skin was not apparently injure Next mark left ear <unclear>considerably</unclear> <unclear>mutilated</unclear> and immediately above and to <unclear></unclear> a scalp would scalp cut through as by a knife about 3/4 inch long <del></del>  could cut it further say two inches each way and I examined it shown gun - says looks just like the one <unclear></unclear> stick - that is the stick did not find <unclear>in dark</unclear> immediately under the wound cut by coroner no other external mark of violence scalp cut no other way  skull above the back of this wound was and the whole skull above this mark was all broken and the other side was worse broken than the side above the cut - simply pronounced it comminuted which means broken

<pb facs="hc.case.0001.012.004"/>

a little peices to remove to <unclear></unclear> they might be <unclear></unclear> - one thing <unclear></unclear> right side of the head had no scalp hand was <unclear>undeniably</unclear> in the deppression should <unclear></unclear> to 1/2 or 3/4 inch and was from 3 to <unclear>thic k</unclear> <unclear></unclear> and  was badly <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear>  should pronounced cause of death Frank Teller produced by blows on the head with some blunt instrument - the blows on either side of the head would produce death - should say that death ensued confidently death would be from concussions of the brain <unclear></unclear> in the head would not produce death one in <unclear></unclear> nearly <unclear></unclear></p>

<p>When I saw deceased was in Spokane County about a mile and half in Washington Territory - I do not know whether defendant had occupied the house <del></del> <del></del> up to the time of the killing or not</p>

<p>X</p>

<p><unclear></unclear> wound near the head on the shoulder could <unclear></unclear> been made by <unclear></unclear> by <unclear></unclear> - the wound on the left side of head could have been produced by board shown gash could have been produced by corner of the board There might be concussion of the brain without fracture of the skull  I dont think there might be a depression on one side of the skull which  <unclear>slowing</unclear> <unclear>on</unclear> <del></del> one side</p>

<pb facs="hc.case.0001.012.005"/>

<p>X</p>

<p>Mutilation of left ear would probably have been made at time cut was made - did not observe wound on right side of neck blood had settled but no abrassion of the skin by witness was wound on left head first fingers broken - no external marks of violence (scalp around) on right side thick blows might be <unclear></unclear> if broken and comminution produce and skull was <del></del> no evidence of scalp wound</p>

<p>Re Direct
 I do not think comminution could be produced by one blow on left side on right side it might have been produced by one single blow of large <unclear>round</unclear> club</p>


<p>Re X</p>
<p>arrange thickness human skull <unclear>ray</unclear> and for 1/8 to 1/2 inch  3/8 inch would be the <unclear></unclear> according to locality - thickness of skull does vary in <unclear>men</unclear></p>

<p>ReRe Direct</p>
<p>Saw Mr Glispen there morning I was there also Dr Renfield and Mr Staltz</p>
