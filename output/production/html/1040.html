    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Albert Weston and John Surra managed and operated a soft drink bar and fruit store in Omaha that allegedly sold alcohol. On June 26, 1924, their bond was set for $5,000 after they were found guilty on the charges of unlawful sale and possession of intoxicating liquor and maintaining a common nuisance. On July 3, 1924, Judge McGee sentenced Albert Weston to two six-month sentences for the alcohol charge and a one-year sentence for the maintenance of a common nuisance charge to be served in the Lincoln County Jail (along with a $500 fine). On December 18, 1924, Albert petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus and argued that he served both six-month sentences concurrently, was entitled to a shortened sentence for good behavior, and that the maintenance of a common nuisance charge was void because it was unconstitutional. The writ was allowed and delivered to the respondents on December 20, 1924. However, the petition was withdrawn by Albert on December 26 and he was returned to the custody of jailor L. L. Berthe. It is possible that he saw other cases filed during the same time frame go to the U.S. Court of Appeals and did not want to prolong the case if the decision would be reversed in a higher court (see Cronin vs. William J. Fox and related cases).</li>
