    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Izora I., petitioner, and Frank H. Goldsborough, respondent, married in 1888 and had their son, Claude H. Goldsborough, the bound party, in March 1889. In September of 1889, Frank agreed that if he were to mistreat either Izora or Claude in any way, he would give up all claims to Claude and give Izora all right to take him, with the process of law. Due to Frank's cruel treatment of both Izora and Claude, they left Frank, returned in May of 1889, and left again for Izora's mother's house in Albright, Nebraska in June of 1890 due to Izora's fear that her and Claude's lives were in danger. Afterward, Izora left for her parent's home with Claude, and on the 22nd day of August 22nd of 1890, while Claude was playing in the yard of Izora's home, Frank came on horseback and seized him. He carried the child to Springfield, Nebraska, from Omaha. During this time, Claude was only dressed in underclothing, a treatment that Izora alleges was inhumane. Additionally, Izora alleges that Frank had no clothing for the infant with him and had no inclination or ability to clothe him. Then, Frank left the child with his parents, Henry and Sophranne Goldsborough, who supported the child, while Frank returned to Omaha. On the 28th of August 1890, Izora filed for a writ of habeas corpus for Claude. Judge Joseph Clarkson allowed the writ of habeas corpus and ordered it to be returnable to Frank, Henry, and Sophranne. During the trial, Frank threatened to kill Izora if she received custody of Claude. Judge Clarkson also ruled that Izora should have full custody of Claude, and Frank must be allowed to visit Claude at the home of Mrs. I. J. Lucas each Sunday afternoon in the presence of an adult. Judge George N. Doane, who hears the case in his courtroom as well, came to the same conclusion as Judge Clarkson. </li>
