<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>IN RE APPLICATION OF 
FRANCIS STEPHEN MEDCRAF
FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS )
No. 3038.
Filed September 23, 1915.</p>

<p>George D. Emery, For Petitioner
Alfred H. Lundin, Prosecuting Atty. ) For State.
Frank P. Helsell Asst. " " )
NETERER, District Judge:</p>

<p>The petitioner alleges that he is unlawfully detained 
and restrained of his liberty by the Sheriff of King County,
Washington, upon a judgment of conviction for violation of the 
provisions of Sections 8412-8425 Remington &amp; Ballinger's Codes
and Statutes of Washington, he being charged with practicing 
dentistry for a fee in the State of Washington, without having 
first filed for record and recorded in the office of the Auditor
of the County wherein he then and there practiced, to-wit,
King County, a certificate from the Board of Dental Examiners 
of the State of Washington, authorizign him to so practice as
provided by law. He alleges that at the age of thirteen he 
was regularly apprenticed to a practicing dentist in London,
England, and served his apprenticeship the full term of five 
years; tha the "worked as a dental assistant" to a surgeon 
dentist at Athens, Greece, for the term of two years, and as a 
dental mechanic in the regular study and practice of that profession;
that he returned to London "for further study and 
prosecuted such study in dental surgery for six months" under William
Lombardi, under whom he served his apprenticeship; tha tin 1896 
he was engaged in the office Dr. Waldo Royce, dentist at 
Tunbridge Wells, England, a graduate of Harvard University, for 
eight months, as general dental assistant; that thereafter he 
was employed by Mr. James Shillcock, at Cannes, France, for five
months; and afterward entered the office of William Lombardi, 
<fw>--1--</fw>
<pb/>
at London, and studi<add>ed</add> and practiced dental surgery for five 
months, and then, at Nice, France, acted as general assistant
and continued in that practice for the term of six months;
and in 1898 served for four months as dental mechanic at Mile
End Road, London, and then returned to Nice, France, where he 
was employed for seven months in the practice of general 
dental work; and, in 1899, acted as general dental mechanic for 
four months in the office of Isador Clifford, in London, who 
treated "the then Prince of Wales, who is now the King of 
England"; did further assistant dental work in 1900, at Nice,
France, and in 1901 returned to London and opened an office
where he continued the practice of dentistry for two years; and
then, on account of ill health, removed to Alberta, Canada, 
where he practiced dentistry for five years, and in February,
1908, removed to Seattle, Washington, "where he has continued
the practice of dentistry undisturbed until the issu<del>e</del> <add>ance</add> of the
warrant of arrest herein complained of." That before beginning
the practice of dentistry in Seattle, Wash. for license 
to practice, <add>he</add> "tendered the legal fee and offered himself for
examination pursuant to law, and in all things complied with 
the requirement of the statutes in such cases made and provided,
save only that he did not present any diploma from any
college of dentistry whatever for the reason that he did not 
possess one and does not now possess any, having obtained his 
profession, learning and skill at the places, by the practice 
and study, and in the manner hereinbefore set forth." That the 
State Board of Dental Examiners refused to receive the application 
of petitioner, and refused to grant him any licesne; and
further states that he is qualified to practice dentistry and
is willing to pay the fees, and sets forth in the petition the 
sections of the act complained of, and alleges that the provisions
contravene Section 1 of Article 14 of the amendments to the
Constitution of the United States, and Section 7 of Article 1
<fw>--2--</fw>
<pb/>
of the Constitution of the State of Washington, and Section 3 
of Article 1 of the State Constitution.</p>
<p>Section 8416, Rem. &amp; Bal. Codes of Washington, in so far 
as pertinent, reads:</p>
    <p>"Any person*****seeking to practice dentistry
    in the State of Washington****shall file his or her 
    name, together with the application for examination
    with the Secretary of the State Board of Dental 
    Examiners, and at the time of making such application
    shall pay to the Secretary of the Board a fee of 
    $25.00 and to present him or herself at the first 
    regular meeting thereafter of said Board to undergo
    examination before that body.</p>
    <p>No person shall be eligible for such examination 
    unless he or she shall present to said Board his or 
    her diploma from some dental college in good standing 
    and shall give satisfactory evidence of his or her 
    rightful possession of the same; PROVIDED, this 
    section shall not apply to persons engaged in the 
    practice of dentistry at the time of the passage of this 
    act who are bona fide citizens of the State of 
    Washington.*****"</p>
<p>The act further provides for the issuance of a certificate and
the record thereof in the Auditor's office and a penalty for the 
violation of the provisions of the act, and <del>then</del> Section 8424 
defines dentistry as follows: "All persons shall be said to be 
practicing dentistry within the meaning of the chapter, who 
shall, contrary to this act, for a fee or salary or other reward, 
paid either to himself or to another person for operations or 
parts of operations of any kind, treat diseases or lesions of 
the human teeth or of jaws or correct malpositions thereof."
The underscored portion of the section of the statute is attacked.
These various constitutional provisions can be discussed 
together. Section 1, Article 14 of the amendments to the
Constitution of the United States, provides:</p>
    <p>"*****nor shall any State deprive any person of 
    life, liberty or property without due process of law, 
    nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the 
    equal protection of the laws."</p>
<p>Article 5 of the Constitution of the United States:</p>
    <p>*****No person****shall be deprived of life, 
    liberty or property without due process of law."</p>
<p>Section 12, Article 1 of the Constitution of Washington:</p>
    <p>"No law shall be passed granting to any citizen 
    or class of citizens, or corporation, other than
<fw>--3--</fw>    
<pb/>    
    municipal, privileges or immunities which, upon the 
    same terms, shall not belong equally to all citizens
    or corporations."</p>
<p>Section 7, Article 1:</p>
    <p>"No person shall be disturbed in his private
    affairs or his home invaded without authority of 
    law."</p>
<p>Section 3, Article 1:</p>
    <p>"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty 
    or property without due process of law."</p>
<p>It is strenuously urged on behalf of the petitioner
that since the profession of dental surgery or dentistry is a
profitable employment and an honorable profession, and oflarge
importance to the petitioner as a means of earning a livelihood, 
and to the public in that it gives it efficient service, that
the act transgresses the several provisions of the Constitution
of the State and the United States, in that it deprives the petitioner,
without due process of law, of that which to him is property
and which enables him to provide for himself and his family, and
that it is not within the police power of the State.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Gray, in Leisey v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 127, in
speaking of the police power, said:</p>
    <p>"It is that power which is characterized as the 
    inherent power essential to the very existence of civil 
    society and the safeguard of the inhabitants of the State
    against disorder, disease, poverty and crime."</p>
<p>Courts cannot place precise limits upon the police power of the
State. Each case must be controlled by the facts peculiar to its
situation and condition, but the exercise must be reasonable as 
distinguished from arbitrary or capricious, and when no 
discrimination between persons or classes upon any matter pertinent to 
the legal purpose of the law appears, it is not in contravention 
of any rights protected by the constitutional provisions, even 
though it may emphasize the condition or situation upon one more
than upon another because of the pecuniary situation. The mere
fact of discrimination because of pecuniary situation of itself
does not make the law subject to legal criticism. The right to 
<fw>--4--</fw>
<pb/>
enjoy life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness is 
secured to everyone under the States and Federal Constitutions,
and any act which deprives a man of the right to labor or 
restricts his liberty or capacity to earn wages over and beyond
any deprivation of all others does not afford such person the 
equal protection of the law. This right and liberty, however,
is not unlimited, and if a restriction is placed upon all alike, 
that right is not invaded. The State Court, in State ex rel
Thompson v. State Board, 48 Wash. 29, held the act in issue to 
be within the police power of the state and not in contravention 
of any constitutional provision, and at page 293 said:</p>
    <p>"The statute makes the same requirements of all 
    applicants for examination. No favored or preferred 
    classes are created or recognized. An applicant who 
    holds a diploma must also pass an examination. Rightful
    possession of his diploma does not of itself authorize
    him to practice, or entitled him to a license. The 
    requirement for both diploma and examination as a test 
    of knowledge<del>i</del> is not such an unreasonable or arbitrary 
    one as to invalidate the statute. The right to determine 
    what requirements must be met by an applicant is 
    within the exclusive province of the legislature. This 
    statute was considered in the case of In re Thompson,
    36 Wash. 377, 78 Pac. 899, in which it was attacked as 
    unconstitutional and was sustained by this court. Without
    further discussion, we now adhere to the ruling then
    made."</p>
