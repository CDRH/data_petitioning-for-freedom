<p>In the District Court of the United States,
Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application
of Marie Miler for Writ of Habeas 
Corpus. } No. 2457.
Filed May 14, 1913</p>
<p>Cushman, District Judge.</p>
<p>Petitioner seeks her discharge upon habeas corpus
from the custody of the Commissioner of Immigration, who holds
her under a warrant of deportation. She alleges that at the 
hearing for her deportation, she was not represented by counsel;
that she had retained counsel before the hearing and had paid
his fee, but he failed to appear and represent her; that she
does not understand the English language and that the evidence
on which she was ordered deported was a false affidavit, which
she had no opportunity to controvert, owing to the fact that
counsel, whom she had retained, did nothing to protect her rights.
That the affidavit against her was made by a former partner to
get rid of her to acquire her property. That she is about to
be deported without due process of law and without an apportunity
to be heard.</p>
<p>The answe of the Commissioner of Immigration shows
that the petitioner was arrested, charged with being an alien
found in the United States in violation of the Act of Congress
approved Feburary 20, 1907, as amended int eh Act approved 
March 28, 1910, to-wit: "That the siad alien was connected
with a house of prositution, and practiced prostitution and
derived benefits therefrom after she entered the United States";
<pb/>
that she ws thereafter examined on January 13, 1913, by an
Inspector, under oath, as to her right to remain in the United States; that she was informed of her right to employ an attorney:</p>
