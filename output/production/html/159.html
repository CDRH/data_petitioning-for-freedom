    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Tom Buras was accused of stealing a Cadillac in St. Joseph, Missouri and was arrested and incarcerated in his hometown of Omaha. However, his father, Josef Buras, assisted by Tom's attorneys John W. Baldwin and James H. Walker, filed a writ of habeus corpus on August 6, 1921, saying that Tom couldn't be guilty of the crime as he wasn't in St. Joseph at the time. Originally, the writ was addressed to police commissioner Henry Dunn, chief of police Michael Dempsey and chief of detectives Charles Van Dusen, but it was only served to Henry Dunn on the advice of Buras's attorneys. By August 8, the writ was served, but on August 12, the case was dismissed "upon motion of attorney for applicant." Census records indicate that Tom was eventually released, however, as in the 1920 census, he is living in his father's house. </li>
