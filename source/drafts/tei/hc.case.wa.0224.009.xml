<p><unclear></unclear> GARNETT called as a witness being first 
sworn, testified as follows: 
</p> 
<p>MR GRANT: In this matter Your Honour the Police have laid a 
charge against Mr Garnett of receiving stolen property, and
now they propose to enquire as to the property he received.
I would ask that none of this evidence be used against him</p> 
<p>MR KENNEDY: That certainly will go and further than that I am
prepared to say this, if Mr Garnett turn out King's Evidence -
I don't want to make any promise - but it goes as a matter 
of course e...</p> 
<p>COURT: You understand that any evidence you may give will not be
used against you.</p> 
<p>QUESTIONS by MR KENNEDY:</p> 
<p>123 Q. Mr Garnett what is your occupation? A. Barber.</p>
<p>124 Q. Do you know Lewis Johnston? A. Yessir</p> 
<p>125 Q. On or about the 4th of June, that would be about two
weeks ago yesterday, did you have occasion, or near then, to
see him? A. I don't remember the date, but I had occasion to
see him</p> 
<p>126 Q. Do you remember what day it was? A. No sir I do not.</p> 
<p>127 Q. You don't remember whether it was Sunday or Monday?
A. No I don't remember</p> 
<p>128 Q. It was about two weeks ago? A. It might be, possibly be</p> 
<p>129 Q. Where and under what circumstances did you see him then? 
A. Johnston came to me one evening and said to me he wanted
me to keep some money for him; so I said "alright", so I got
an envelope out of the coset and I gave it to him and he
put some money on it. So when I had taken the money I said
"what are you doing with so much money?"</p> 
<p>130 Q. How much money was it? A. I don't know</p> 
<p>131 Q. You are evidently impressed with the amount of it; 
were there a number of bills? What impressed you? A. Well 
I really thought he had possibly seventy, eighty, or one hun-
dred dollars, something like that. That was just my idea. 
It might have been ten thousand dollars, I 
<pb></pb> 
<unclear></unclear> 
132 Q. I saw that there was a roll of bills, was there? A. Yes.
So I said "what are you doing with so much money?" He said 
"I just beat" - no, he said "I just been over and beat some
Bohunks out of some money" I said "it is pretty good for 
you" So I put the money in the safe. And I was going home
that morning about 3:30 and I met him on the Powell Street 
playgrounds.</p>  
<p></p>
<p>134 Q. You had a conversation with him, Mr. Garnett, and eventually
did you give him any more money? A. Well yes. So he came on 
back....</p> 
<p>COURT: Cout out those long conversations</p> 
<p>A. I have got to tell you right.</p> 
<p>COURT: Look here Garnett simply answer the questions.</p> 
<p>A. I said "yes"</p>
<p>135 Q. </p>
