<p>IN THE Circuit COURT
OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE 
DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Peter A. Clifford,
Petitioner,
vs.
Herbert O. Williams, and
Grace E. Williams,
Respondents.</p>

<p>O P I N I O N</p>

<p>Filed June 28, 190x
A. Reeves Ayres, Clerk,
By A. N. Moor, Deputy.</p>

<p>IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, NINTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT
DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON,
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>PETER A. CLIFFORD,
Petitioner,
vs.
HERBERT O. WILLIAMS and
GRACE E. WILLIAMS,
Respondents.</p>

<p>In this cause I hereby certify that the judgment of dis-
missal herein made is based solely on the grounds that while 
the record herein shows a controversy, between a citizen of
the State of California on the one hand and citizens of the
State of Washington on the other still it does not show such a
controversy, in my opinion, between citizens of different states,
as will confer jurisdiction upon a Circuit Court of the United 
States, and that the declaration or petition, in my opinion, dis-
closes the infraction of no right arising under or out of the
Federal Laws of Constitution; and that treating the motion
to dismiss as presenting the questions of jurisdiction, and
acting also, independently of the motion, and on the courts
own motion, the suit is dismissed only for the reasos above
stated; that it that the cotroversy not being such between
citizens of different states as to confer jurisdiction upon
a circuit Court of the United States, and not being one aris-
ing under the Laws of the Constitution of the United States,
there is consequently no jurisdiction of the Circuit Court
of the United States.</p>

<p>This certificate is made conformably to Act of Congress
of Maarch 3, 1891, Chapter 517, and the opinion filed herein is
made a part of the record and will be ccertified and sent up as
a part of the proceedings, together with this certificate.
This 25th day of A. D., 1904.</p>

<p>The petition of Peter A. Clifford herein, having come on
