<p>IN THE UNITED STATES COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF 
WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>PETITION OF EDWARD KRAUSE
FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.))) 3166</p> 
<p>To the Honorable Jeremiah Neterer, Judge of the 
Circuit of the United States for the Western District of
Washington, Northern Division:</p> 
<p>The petition of Edward Krause of Petersburg, Ter-
ritory of Alaska, respectfully shows to the Court that he is
imprisoned and restrained of his liberty by the United States
Marshall of the foregoing District in the State of Washington,
County of King.</p> 
<p>That said imprisonment and restraint are illegal
because of the following facts, to-wit:</p>
<p>That the said Edward Krause was arrested upon a warrant is-
sued by Robert W. McClelland, United States Commissioner for
the Western District of Washington, upon the affidavit of one
Clay Allen, deposing that the said Edward Krause had commit-
ted a crime in the Territory of Alaska and outside of the
State of Washington and against and in violation of Section
27 of the Alaska Criminal Code.</p> 
<p>That a preliminary hearing was given the said
Edward Krause before the said Commissioner in the County of
King and State of Washington and that the said Commissioner
has entered an order or judgment binding over the said</p> 
<pb></pb>
<p>Edward Krause to the Grand Jury in the said Territory of
Alaska at Juneau and that an order has been issued by this
Court that the said Edward Krause be taken from the County
of King and State of Washington by the United States Marshall
for the Western District of Washington, to the Territory of
Alaska at Juneau and there delivered to the United States
Marshall of said District.</p> 
<p>Your petitioner further shows that the act com-
plained against your petitioner, if any he has committed, is
not in violation of any law of the United States but that,
according to the warrant, said act, if any has been committed
by your petitioner, as alleged in the said affidavit, is in
violation of the laws of the Territory of Alaska.</p> 
<p>Your petitioner further shows that no extradition
papers signed by the Governor of Alaska, as provided by law,
has been issued and no rendition warrant for the arrest and
extradition of the said Edward Krause has been issued by the
Governor of the State of Washington or served upon said
Edward Krause.</p> 
<p>For the further reason that, as shown by the evi-
dence introduced before the said Commissioner, there was no
proof that any crime had been committed, in that the evidence
showed that the petitioner had taken one William Christie
from the Town of Treadwell to a place near the shore of
Juneau in Alaska and that the said Christie was taken there-
from by a third party; that the petitioner has seen in the
papers published at Juneau that the said Christie had been
abducted and that his whereabouts were not known; that the
petitioner, fearing there might be trouble over Christie
being brought from Treadwell to Juneau, left the vicinity of</p>
<pb></pb> 
<p>Juneau, assumed the alias of Moe, and, fearing that he might
become in difficulty because thereof, left the vicinity of
Juneau and the Territory of Alaska; that no other evidence
was introduced of the abduction or disappearance or absence
of the said William Christie and no evidence was introduced
of any search having been made for the said Christie.</p>
<p>That the said Edward Krause is not committed or de-
tained by virtue of any process issued or any final judgment
or decree of any competent tribunal of evil or criminal
jurisdiction, or by virtue of any execution issued upon said
judgment or decree.</p> 
<p>Your petitioner therefore prays that a Writ of
Habeas Corpus may issue, directed to the said Marshall of the
United States for the Western District of Washington and to
his deputies or any or either of them, commanding him that he
have the body of the said Edward Krause, by him imprisoned
and detained, together with the time and cause of said im-
prisonment and detention, before the Honorable Jeremiah Neterer
Judge of the District of the Western District of Washington,
Northern Division, at the United States Court House at Seattle
King County, State of Washington, at the hour of 2 P. M. on the
18th day of November, 1915, and to do and receive what shall
there an then be considered or ordered concerning the said
Edward Krause.</p> 
<p>Dated this 17th day of November, 1915.</p> 
<p>F. Gesttan O'Bryan
Attorney for Petitioner.</p>
