      <p class="tei_p">III.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">That on or about the 13th day of October, 1914, your 
petitioner was taken into custody at Skagway, Alaska, by one
Albert H. Joy, Immigration Inspector of the United States, upon
a warrant issued by one J. B. Densmore, Acting Secretary of 
Labor of the United States, charging your petitioner with 
being an alien in the United States of America and with being
a prostitute, and that she entered the United States
for the purpose of prostitution. That thereafter, a hearing
was had before the said Albert H. Joy on the 15th day of
October, 1914, and said cause was transferred for further hearing
to Seattle, Washington, where a hearing upon such charge
was held before Thos. W. Lynch, Examining Inspector, and 
thereafter your petitioner was taken into custody and is now in 
custody of Henry M. White, Commissioner of Immigration, under and 
by virtue of a warrant issued by the Secretary of the Department
of Labor of the United States of America directing that 
your petitioner be deported from the United States of America
and transported to the Empire of Russia for the reason as
stated in said warrant, that your petitioner is an alien in 
the United States and has been found practicing prostitution
in the United States of America.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">IV.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that she is restrained
of her liberty by the said Henry M. White, as such Commissioner 
of Immigration, under a claim that she is subject to deportation
for a violation of the laws of the United States in that
being an alien she was found practicing prostitution in the
United States of America.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that she is held in 
custody under and by virtue of a claim that she has violated 
the laws of the United States of America, and is being held 
in such custody within the district and division aforesaid.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">VI.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that she is unable to 
attach hereto a copy of the process under which she is held
in custody and restrained of her liberty for the reason that
she has no such copy in her possession, and for the reason that
she has not been furnished with such copy.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">VII.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner, however, avers that she is being now
restrained of her liberty and held in the custody of Henry M.
White, Commissioner of Immigration, under a pretense of a law
of the United States of America.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">VIII.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that at the said hearing
before the said Thos. W. Lynch, Examining Inspector, it
appeared conclusively and without contradiction that your
petitioner at all times since her said marriage with the said
Fred Dickinson has been a resident of the United States of
America and a citizen thereof, and that the said warrant of 
the Secretary of Labor is invalid and of now force and effect 
in law for the reason that your petitioner is not an alien.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">IX.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner now complains that she is unlawfully 
restrained of her liberty by the said Henry M. White under the 
pretense that she has violated a law of the United States of 
America, which pretense and claim is unfounded in fact and is 
to the said Henry M. White and to the Secretary of Labor of
the United States well known.</p>

by the said Henry M. White her rights as an American citizen
are infringed and she is deprived of her liberty without any 
warrant of law and that such restraint is illegal and invalid.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">XI.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that in the hearing
before the officers of the Immigration Service of the United
States, she was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, 
to meet the witnesses face to face, and that your petitioner 
in such hearing before the officers of the Immigration Service 
of the United States was denied a fair and impartial hearing, 
and that there was no testimony taken before the said Albert
H. Joy or Thos. W. Lynch tending to show, or which did show,
that your petitioner was at any time subsequent to her said
intermarriage with said Fred Dickinson an alien to the United
States of America.</p>

the writ of right, a Writ of Habeas Corpus to The Honorable 
Henry M. White, Commissioner of Immigration, directing,
