to get him to go out again she took
him by the shoulder again and 
tried to get him out again and 
he struck her some where about the 
shoulder think it was on the right shoulder 
she drew back pointed the pistol 
and it went off then the man stood
there he was shot I guess, he fell 
down in the hall it is a small 
hall and he fell between the two 
doors, Think she dropped the 
Revolver and went to helping 
the man and said O My God
have I shot you or hurt you 
and he said lay me down then 
she asked for water, a few minutes 
after that She helped to lay him down 
asked for water I did not get it 
for her and then the crowd 
gathered around I think she 
got water herself crowd was 
gathering in front dont know 
who was first there when the crowd 
first came she was ringing her
hands saying My God have 
I hurt you she usually kept 
her pistol on a empty chamber 
She did not khow it know it would 
go off and did not mean to shoot
