they or either of them wrongfully or unlawfully detain or restrain said Etta Dora Cravens of her liberty at the court of Wallula County of WallaWalla Territory of Washington or elsewhere</p>

<p>4 Defendants aver that said minor child has been in the posession of said defendants for about three years <del>and now</del> that the said child has been sickly that said defendants have been at great expense and trouble in the rearing so far of said child that they have taken great care pain and trouble with said child and have watched over the same and have become greatly attached thereto</p>

Defts aver that they did on the day of August  AD 1868 take said child from its mother Martha J Cravens under said arrangement and have kept and provided for the same ever since defts aver that the disposition manifested toward
