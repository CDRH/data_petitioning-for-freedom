<p>IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, FOR THE DISTRICT OF
WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>In the Matter of:</p>

<p>The application of Antwine Michel for a Writ
of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>PETITON FOR WRIT</p>

<p>To the Honorable C.H. Hanford, Judge:</p>

<p>The petition of Antwine Michel respectfully shows to Your
Honor:</p>

<p>That he is now and imprisonment detained and confined in
custody of the United States Marshal for the District of Washingon, in the City Jail of the City of Spokane, and within the District of Washington, for a supposed criminal offense against the
laws of the United States.</p>

<p>Your petitioner further avers, That he is committed and
held by the said Marshal in the said Jail aforesaid by virtue of a 
Process and warrant of Commitment issued by J. W. Marshal, United
States Commissioner for the District of Washington, residing at
Spokane; that on the 12th day of January, A. D. 1898, one Felix
Pugh, a deputy Marshal, upon oath, did charge that on the 29th day
of December, 1898, and within the limits of the Colville Indian 
Reservation, your said petitioner, being then and there an Indian,
did, with a knife, unlawfully and feloniously assault another
Indian named John Whil-Ochen, and did the said John Whil-Ochen then
and there cut and wound, whereof the said John Whil-Ochen did not
die. That a copy of the Warrant of Commitment by which your petitioner is held is hereto annexed.</p>

<p>And your petitioner further avers, That he is not held
for, or charged with, any other different crime against the laws

<pb/>

of the United States, and is not held or detained for any other
reason save as set forth herein.</p>

<p>Your petitioner further avers, That he is advised by his 
Counsel, F. C. Robertson, Esq., residing at Spokane, Washington,
and so believes, that his said imprisonment is illegal, and that
said illegality consists in this, to-wit:</p>

<p>That the said place at which the said cutting and wounding
took place for which the petitioner was arrested, is not within
the limits of the Colville Indian Reservation, as the same now is
set apart, designated and created by the laws of the United States, but the said crime, if committed at all, was committed upon
the public domain outside of the limits of said Colville Indian Reservation; That the said place where the said crime was
committed, if committed at all, was wholly within the limits of the 
County of Stevens and of the State of Washington. That the place
where the said difficulty occurred between your petitioner and the 
said Indian John Whil-Ochen was at a point northerly from the 
town of Marcus, Stevens County, Washington, and on the northern
bank of Kettle River, aboout nine (9) miles from the said town of
Marcus and at a point along which the public road passes from said
town of Marcus to the town of Grand Forks, British Columbia. That
the said point and place where the said difficulty occurred, under
the laws of the United States and the decisions of this Court, has
been held to be and is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
County of Stevens, Washington, for all purposes of civil and
criminal jurisdiction; and the said place and point is not within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States of within the jurisdiction of the United States whatever;
 </p>

<pb/>

<p>W H E R E F O R E , Your petitioner prays for a Writ
of Habeas Corpus to the end that he may be discharged from custody.</p>
