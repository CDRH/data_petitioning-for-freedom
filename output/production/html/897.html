    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Molly Martin petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve her son, Earl Martin, from his grandmother, Susie Harris, which was granted. Mary had obtained a divorce from Mrs. Harris's son, Joe Martin. After hearing the evidence, the writ was allowed and Earl released into his mother's custody. The court, however, determined that both women were "fit and proper persons to have custody of said child," and allowed Susie to have custody of Earl one day each month and one month each summer. Molly petitioned to modify the custody arrangement a few times over the next several years, but was unsuccessful. </li>
