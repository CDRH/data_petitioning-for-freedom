    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 9, 1919, Agnes Marshall was arrested without a warrant at No. 1613 North 16th Street, where she says she was working caring for a woman named Mrs. Ashmore. She was taken to the city jail until she paid a bail of $300. After she did, the police judge demanded that she be released, but the head matron at the detention home where she was being held, Alta Burger, refused to let her go until she had been tested for veneral disease. This indicates that Marshall was originally arrested for prostitution, despite it not being explicitly said in the case. However, Marshall refused to be tested unless her doctor was present. Therefore, on August 13, 1919, Marshall filed a writ of habeus corpus against Burger.  While the petition was allowed, the case was eventually dismissed for want of prosecution on January 30, 1920, with Marshall responsible for paying all costs.</li>
