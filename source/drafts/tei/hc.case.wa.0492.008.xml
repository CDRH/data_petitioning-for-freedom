<p> In the Matter of the 
application of Francis Stephen Medcraf
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>Brief For Petitioner.</p>

<p>MR GEO. D. EMERY, for the Petitioner</p>

<p>THE PETITIONER was charged and conviced before a Justice of the
Peace with the 'crime' of practicing dentistry without a certificate'
contrary to the provisions of the Dental Code of Washington.</p>

<p>Having been committed to prison under this conviction he brings
this proceeding to enquire into the lawfulness of the imprisonment.</p>

<p>He alleges that the statute under which these proceedings were 
had and the conviction was entered is void because in conflict with 
the provisions of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, in that he is deprived of his liberty and property
without due process of law and that the Act in question denys to him
(a person within the jurisdiction of the State) the 'equal protection
of the laws'.</p>

<p>The amendment in question provides,
"nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or 
property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protectoin of the laws."</p>

<p>Sec. 1977 of the Comp. Laws of the U.S. guarantees equal rights
under the law to all 'persons' within the jurisdiction of the States
and under the laws of every state. Such 'persons' shall have the 
right "in every state and territory- - to the full and equal benefit
of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property"</p>

<p>The citizenship of the 'person' is therefore of no consequence.
The pledge of 'equal protection of the laws' is a pledge of the 
protection of 'equal' laws. <add>Yick Wo vs Hopkins 118 U.S. 356.</add></p>

<p>THE FIRST DENTAL CODE of Washington is found in Hills Statutes
&amp; Codes of Wash. Sec. 2854 et seq. being the Act of Jany 1888.</p>

<p><add>1</add></p>

<pb></pb>

<p>It provides;
"--it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the 
practice of dentistry in the state of Washington, unless said 
person has graduated and received a diploma from the faculty of a dental 
college chartered under the authority of some one of the United
States or foreign governments, or shall have obtained a certificate
from a board of dentists duly authorized and appointed by the 
provisions of this chapter to issue such certificates."</p>

<p>A board of 5 dentists is provides for to be appointed by
the Governor who are to be "practicing dentists" and take an oath 
of office.</p>

<p>Persons practicing dentistry in the state at the passage of
the Act must enroll their names with the Board within 3 months and 
shall thereupon-without examination- receive a certificate as a 
practitioner of dentistry within the state.</p>

<p>All others desiring to practice dentistry must submit to an 
examination before the Board and must show the posession of skill in
dental surgery 'satisfactory to said Board', and shall thereupon
receive such certificate to practice.</p>

<p>IN 1893 this law was amended; The new act provided for
A slight change in the system of appontents of the Board.</p>

<p>Examination of those desiring to practice dentistry in the 
state, prescribing a standard of qualifications and requiring that 
"no person shall be eligible for such examination unless he or she
shall be of good moral character and shall present to said board his
or her diploma from some dental college in good standing and shall
give satisfactory evidence of his or her rightful possession of the 
same; PROVIDED, That the said Board may admit to examination such
other persons of good moral character as shall give satisfactory evidence
of having been engaged in the practice of dentistry ten years
prior to the date of the application for examination."</p>

<p>All persons authorized to practice under the former law and 
still engaged in practice are to be enrolled and licensed without 
further examination.</p>

<p>Students enrolled in a regular dental college and studying
in a licensed dentists office in the state are exempted from the 
penal provisions and might practice under their preceptor.</p>

<p>(N.B. There was then, as now, no 'dental college' in the State
so the regular attendance thereon required by the act was of no 
value or efffect in fact)</p>

<p>IN 1901 this law materially amended and all its provisions
inconsistent with the new act were repealed. This act is Chap 152 of
the Laws of 1901. Section 4 of this act provides;</p>

<p>"Any person or persons seeking to practice dentistry in the state
of Washington, or to own, operate or cause to be operated or run,
or manage a dental office or place for the practice of dentistry in
the State of Washington, after the passage of this Act, shall file
his or her name, together with an application for examination, with

<add>2</add>

<pb></pb>

the Secretary of the State Board of Dental Examiners at the time
of making such application, shall pay to the secretary of such Board
a fee of twnty-five dollars nd present him or herself at the first
regular meeting thereafter of said Board to undergo examination 
before that body.</p>

<p>No person shall be eligible for such examination unless he or
she shall present to said Board his or her diploma from some Dental
College in good standing and shall give satisfactory evidence of his 
or her rightful possession of the same; PROVIDED, this section shall
not apply to persons engaged in the practice of dentistry at the 
time of the passage of this act who are bona fide citizens of the 
State of Washington."</p>

<p>Provision is made for the issue of licence or certificate to the 
successful applicant and for recording such certificate and the practice
without such record of dentistry is made penal under fine of
$50.00 to $200.00 or imprisonment in the County Jail for not more
than six months.</p>

<p>It appears by the record that the state Board of Dental Examiners 
employed one Conover to go the office of petitioner and secure
his professional services to remove two decayed teeth and paid him
therefor. Thereupon Conver - by direction of the Board - filed a 
complaint with the Justice, secured a warrant thereon and the arrest 
of petitoner for 'practicing dentistry without having a certificate
of admission to practice recorded with the County Auditor', contrary
to said Act. <add>(State Board Prosecuting Case)</add></p>

<p>Upon the trial, petitioner duly raised all the constitutional
questions here presented but his objections being overruled, the
evidence was taken. It thereby appeared that petitioner had served
five years as an apprentice to a competent and reuptable dentists in
London, Eng; had continuously thereafter practiced dentistry in the 
employ of competent dentists in England, France and Greece for 8
years: thereafter continued suchc practiced for himself in London, 
Canada and the United States for 7 years and thereafter in Seattle for 
7 years, making a continuous practice of 27 years-including his
apprenticeship. That he had, before commencing practice in Seattle,
duly applied to the said Board of Dental Examiners, tendered the fee
and requested and appeared for examination but such examination was
refused on the ground that petititoner had no diploma from a dental
college. Whereupon and for that reason a certificate and licence 
were refused. His conviction and sentence followed.</p>

<p><add>3</add></p>

<pb></pb>

<p>ARGUMENT</p>

<p>THE POWER OF POLICE REGULATION of the practice of DENTISTRY by the
State being conceded, it is contended by the Petitioner that this
Act far transcends the powers of the State in that particular.</p>

<p>It is unreasonable in its provisions; an unnecessary and improper
restricction of and infringement upon the rights of the individual to 
practice his profession for his livelihood; unnecessarily deprives
him of property and restrains his liberty, contrary to the constitutional
provision referred to; and constitutes unlawful discrimination, 
and is therefore VOID.</p>

<p>"In the exercise of the police power in the regulation of 
business, the legislature may not arbitrarily impose any vexatious 
burdens upon the pursuit of any of these avocations."</p>

Kan. City Gas Co. vs Kan. City 198 Fed. 500
Harmon vs State 66 Oh. St. Rep 254</p>

<p>"The public power to regulare railroads and the private right 
of ownership of such property co-exist; they do not destroy each one
the other; and where the power to regulate is so arbitrarily 
exercised as to infringe upon the rights of ownership, the exertion is
void because it is repugnant to the due process and equal protection
clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>

<p>Atlantic Coast Line RR. vs North Car. 206 U.S. 1</p>

<p>"There is no easier nor more tempting opportunity for the 
practices of tyranny than in the police control of occupations. Good and 
bad motives often combine to accomplish this kind of tyranny. The 
seal of the reformer as well as cupidity and self interest must
alike be guarded against. Both are apt to prompt the employment of
means to attain an end desired, which the constitution prohibits."</p>

<p>---"if the business is not inherently harmful, the prosecution
of it cannot rightfully be prohibited to one who will conduct it in 
a proper and circumspect manner. Such an one would be 'deprived of
his liberty without due process of law'."</p>

<p>Tiedman on Police Powers Sec. 102.</p>

<p>"Any prohibition which extends further than to prevent the 
mission of incompetent men, will be unconstitutional."</p>

<p>Ib. Sec. 87</p>

<p>"If under the guise of the police power, the legislature unreasonably 
and capriciously restrains one's liberty or property, the 
Court may interpose the Constitution and declare the law void."</p>

<p>State vs Smith 33 L.R.A. (NS) 187. (Mo.)</p>

<p>A law wich unnecessrily and oppressively restrains a citizen
from engaging in any traffic or disposing of his property as he may
see fit, though passed under the specious pretext of a preservative
of the health of the inhabitants, would be void."</p>

<p>State vs Fischer 52 Mo. 174</p>

<p>The right to practice one's profession is 'property' of which he may
not be unnecessarily or arbitrarily deprived.</p>

<p><add>6</add></p>

<pb></pb>

<p>State vs Sachs 2 Wash 373</p>

<p>The practice of the profession of Dental Surgery or Dentistry is
a profitable employment, an honorable profession and an important
one both to the petitioner and to the public. The sole element
of danger and the sole point at which the police power pproches it 
is in the admission to practice of incompetent persons. The health
of the public demands that due precautions be exercised by the state
in admitting to practice dentistry only those who are qualified and
possess good moral character and the requisite technical kill.</p>

<p>Beyond this the State has no right or power to go. In prescribing 
the standard of qualification it must look to the true purpose which
it is authorized to conserve. It may not, under the pretext of a 
police regulation, create and protect a select and favored class, to
the exclusion of others equally well qualified to practice the 
profession. Wherein does a diploma entitle a man to undergo an 
examination to test his fitness, any more than long years of active and
arduous practice and practical experience under qualified tutors></p>

<p>Why may the boy or girl fresh from the halls of some Dental 
college, be admitted to display his or her qualifications by examination
while the actual practitioner of 27 years standing, of wide and 
valuable actual practice and experience, is debarred therefrom?</p>

<p>Is such a requirement 'reasonably necessary' to the health of the 
inhabitants? Or is it not rather valuable in that it will restrict
the number of practitioners that may come in from other states to the
possible detriment of the present local practitioners?</p>

<p>It is said that the legislature is the best judge of the neccessity 
for the exrcise of the police power and the means of accomplishing 
that exercise. This may possess some merit but it must not be
carried too far. The moment that the legislature transcends the 
limit of 'reasonable and necessary requirement' it comes in conflict
with the Constitutional provision and must fall.</p>

<p>In Eastman vs State 10 N.E. 97 cited by the respondent here, the 
supreme court of Indiana announced the strange doctrine that the 
question of whether the eact was reasonable or not was a legislative
<add>5</add>

<pb></pb>

and not a judicial question. Strange assumption. If this were
true, how could the courts ever determine a law to be unconstitutional</p>

<p>The legislature having adopted it, must be presumed to have found
it necessary, <add>and reasonable</add> therefore it is constitutional!</p>

<p>Again and again the Supreme Court of the United States has 
contradicted this doctrine and held that the reasonbleness of the law
and its necessit are for the Court to pass upon and if found 
unreasonably and unnecessary as an exercise of the police power, it is
void.</p>

<p>"To justify the state in thus interposing its authority in behalf 
of the public, it must appear, first, that the interests of the public
generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, 
requries such interferance: and, second that the means are reasonably 
necessary for the accomplishment of ther purpose and not unduly oppressive
upon individuals: The legislature may not, under the guise of 
protecting the public interests, arbirtrarily interfere with private
business, or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon lawful
occupations. In other words, its determination at to what is a proper
exercise of its police powers is not final or conclusive, but is
subject to the supervision of the Courts." Afteer citing numerous case
the court continues;</p>

<p>"In all these cases the acts were held to be invalid as involving
an unnecessary invasion of the rights of property and a practical 
inhibition of certain occupations, harmless in themselves, and which 
might be carrie don without detriment to the public interest."</p>

<p>Sanitary Dist. vs C. &amp; A. R. Co. 108 N.E. 314</p>

<p>The exercise of the police powere must be necessary and its 
methods reasonable in their provisions and must not unnecessarily nor
arbitrarily interface with the inherent rights of the citizens. When
they go beyond these limits, the are in conflict with the Constitution
and have no validity.</p>

<p>State vs Florida E.C. RR. 67 So. 911
Atlantic C.Eine RR vs North Car. 206 U.S. 1</p>

<p>THE OBJECT OF THE LAW is the protection of thehealth of the 
inhabitants. To that end, the qualifications of those who assume to 
practice dentistry are material and of importance. Reasonable tests and
regulations to secure the end are lawful and if such interfere with 
the right of the individual to practice, they are still valid. But
when they go beyond the line of reason or necessity and are no longer
regulative of the practice of the profession but undly restrict that
right in a qualified individual, they are prohibited by the Federal 
Constitution.<add>6</add></p>

<pb></pb>

<p>7</p>

<p>Every citizen has a right to engage in any lawful pursuit.
This is a natural right. The practice of Dentistry could not lawfully
be prohibited by the State nor could it be materially hampered
without great inconvenience and injurty to the public. Like the 
practice of law or medicine it is essential to the health and well
being of the people. When the State has taken reasonable and proper
measures to protect the pople from impositon and want of skill
on part of its practitioners, it has fulfilled its duty and
exhausted its power. It is fitting that practitioners be required to 
possess good moral character and to be skilled in their profession.
Such skill may be attained, in a perfunctory way, by a course in a 
dental college, but without practical experience, the graduate is
not thoroughly competent to practice. He is only beginning his
experience. It is idle to compare the skill of a youthful graduate
just from his college with the ripened experience of the practitioner
of 27 years actual practice of his profession. Why should the one 
be admitted to the test of an examination as to fitness and not the 
other?</p>

<p>At common law the field of dental practice was open to all. The 
practitoner was held liable in damages for any act or neglect not 
justified by his professions. A system of apprenticeship was 
recognized and became an established custom. This of course was long
before any Dental College was founded. The custom grew into a law
and the greatest dental practitioners of modern times obtained their 
first professional shcooling through the apprenticehsip to some
dentist. The custom still prevails in almost every stte and is recognized
in our own. There is not and never was a dental college 
in this State. How then can an apprentice or student be enrolled 
in and attend lectures in such a college and at the same time gain
anything of knowledge froma  dental preceptor in this state?</p>

<p>Such a provision of law is meaningless in view of the conditions.
In almost every state there exists an association of dentists 
under various names, constituting a state dental society. This 
ystem of societies is bound together by a National organization.</p>

<p>In purusit of its own purposes, this society has framed and 
pressed to enactment the laws governing the practice of dentistry <add>7</add>

<pb></pb>

<add>8</add>
in may of the states, notably in New York, Minneota, Michigan, 
Wisconsin, the Carolinas, North Dakota, Oregon, California, and
Washington.</p>

<p>In the states where such society has secured legislation, the 
requirement of a diploma is made a pre-requisite to an examination,
always excepting those in actual practice when such acts were passed</p>

<p>In some of these states the Courts have been led into sustaining
such laws though it is apparent frome examination of the deccisons
that the constitutional questions has rarely been raised and 
never upon such a state of facts as here exists. Little authority
is cited to sustain such decisons. The reasons given in support of
them are unsatisfactory and in many cases the question decided is
entirely obiter dictum. </p>

<p>An examination of the statutes of all the states shows;
19 states provide for diploma as pre-requisite to examination.</p>

<p>Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa,
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New
York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin, Washington and Wyoming.</p>

<p>17 states require either a diploma or an examination</p>

<p>Arkansas, Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Montana,
Nevada, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, South Dakota and Utah.</p>

<p>30 prescribe a standard of qualification in specified branchs 
of learning.</p>

<p>18 require an examination "satisfactory to the Board"</p>

<p>A majority of the states providing for both diploma and examination make some provisions whereby the Board of Examiners must consist of 
members of the State Dental Society.</p>

<p>The same states provide, generally, for the admission without
examination upon the certificates of Dental Boards of such states
as admit their practicioners on like certificates-in other words
a reciprocal law.</p>

<p>The New York law is noticable as an example of the influence of
this society. <add>The applicant must have passed 4 years in
a High School and be a graduate of school"</add>
school or its equivalent or must have received as a gradute a dental
degree or have pursued a course of dental study and hold  degree
from some dental colelge or Foreign Country or must have practiced <add>8</add>

<pb></pb>

<add>9</add>
dentistry for 25 years in some state other than New York.</p>

<p>These condtions give much force to the suggestion that the
laws in question are framed with the design to protect the Dental
Society from competition rather than the public. They rank with 
the legislation influenced and secured by Manufacturers, Plumbers,
and declare generally which ostensibly protect the public yet in 
truth serve more perfectly to foster monopolies and combinations.</p>

<p>It would be perfectly easy to enact laws that would really protect
the inhabitants from quacks and unskillful practitioners and 
at the same time give to honest and competent dentists the right to 
live and practice their vocation.</p>

<p>The act of 1901 discriminates against apprentices, no matter 
how skillful they may have become by years of subsequent practice, and 
requires them to go through a dental college in order to be 
entitled to show their qualifications. In othere words, they must
expatriate themselves and taken three years of a dental college
course to learn just what they know already, before they can be even
examined as to their skill and knowledge. To state the case is to 
point its unreason.</p>

<p>OUR OWN SUPREME COURT, in Brown vs State 37 Wash. 105 held this
very act void in part. The act provides that the owner or manager
of a dental office must ve a licensed dentist. This portion was 
held in conflict with the state constitution. The court said;</p>

<p>"We fell that a court should be reluctant to pronounce a statute
invalid except where its plain duty impels such action,. Conceiving
this to be such a case, we are led to declare that part of 
the stature requiring an examination and license in order to 'own,
run or manage' a dental office or department, void."</p>

<p>If this part of the act is void, why not the whole act? Can it 
be presumed tht the legislature would have passed then rest o the 
act, repealing the 'standard' and confining the license privilege to
graduates only, if it had believed the portion stricken to be void?.</p>

<p>The mutilated act is much less valuable to the public than the
act which is supplants. The act of 1893 provides a fixed standard
to which practitioners must conform -  a required amount of skill <add>9</add>

<pb></pb>

10.
<add>42 had Dec 82</add>
which they must possess. This might be show either by a diploma 
from some recognized dental college or by an examination upon certain
fixed subjects, constituting a standard, to which all must attain.</p>

<p>In the same decsion the court further says;</p>

<p>"The police power does not justify the withholding from one 
individual of a natural privilege or right, in order that a corresponding
advantge may be added to the rights or privileges of another.</p>

<p>The restriction is permissible only as a preventive of evil reults 
reasonably to be expected without such limitation.Russell on 
Police Power pp 34,35 says; 'To justify the statute in thus interposing 
its authority, in behalf of the public generally as distinguished from those of
a particular class, require such interferance, and second, that the 
means are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose,
and not unduly oppressive upon individuals.'"</p>

<p>The true test of those who assume to practice dentistry must
necessarily be, not the mere posession of a diploma from some college, 
but the "posession of the actual technical skill nd knowledge
peculiar to the study and practice of dentistry".</p>

<p>It may be proper to provide that the possesssion of such diploma
shall be competent evidence of the possession of suh skill but it 
is manifestly unfair and oppressive to exclude those who possess
this skill, gained from expereience and practice without having
procured a diploma. It is the 'skill and knowledge' which protects
the public -  not the diploma. It is common knowlede that there
are many competent dentists in this country who have obtained their
skill and knowledge from long study and practice in some dentists
office and who never passed through a dental college. The practice 
of apprenticeship prevails in this as in most foreign countries.</p>

<p>Shall all such be excluded from practice-nay, even from 
examination as to their fitness? Must they go to a dental college to 
learn that which they already know?</p>

<p>Again in State vs Calusen 65 Wash. 178, the supreme court of 
this state referring to the police power says;</p>

<p>It is not meant to be asserted that this power is above the 
Constitution, or that everything done in the name of the Police power is
lawfully done. It is meant only to be asserted that a law which 
interferes with personal liberty and property rights is valid only
when it tends reasonably to correct some existing evil or promote
some interest of the state, and is not in violation of any direct
and positive mandate of the Constitution. The caluse of the Constitution
now under consideration was intended to prevent the arbitrary
exercise of power, or undue, unjust, and capricious interferances
with personal rights; not to prevent those reasonable regulations
that all must submit to as a condition of remaining a member of <add>10</add>

society. In other words, the tests of a police regulations, when measured
by this clause of the constitution is reasonableness as 
contra distinguished from arbitrary or capricious action."</p>

<p>Measured by this test, does not this stature violate the constitutional 
provision? Why exclude the large class of competent
apprentice-made dentists for the sole benefit of the college 
graduates who are even far less competnet in point of fact?</p>

<p>Is it reasonable to exclude the large clss of dentists who gained 
their skill and knowledge without the aid of a college education?
Do petitioners 27 1/2 years of apprenticeship and active practice count
for nothing? Is it reasonable to forbid him to demonstrate to the
Board his competency, to exhibit his knowledge and skill, because
he did not obtain them at some dental colege? Or because he did
not live in the state at the time of the passage of the act?</p> 

<p>In state vs Thompson 48 Wash. 291-3 the supreme court of this 
state has declared in favor of the constitutionality of this act.
While this is not binding upon this court it is cited by the 
respondent in support of the conviction. The case is not a 
persuasive one. The arguments seems to beg the question. It is said;
"The statute makes the same requirements of all applicants for 
examination. No favored or preferred classes are created or recognized.
The requirement of both diploma snd examination as a test of 
knowledge and skill is not such an unreasonable or arbitrary one
as to invalidate the statute. The right to determine what requirements
must be met by an applicant is within the exclusive province
of the legislature."</p>

<p>The above statements are peculiar in view of the admitted facts
here. The statue does create and recognize a favored class, viz;
graduates of dental colleges. It discriminates against those who 
are otherwise competent but have no diploma. It ignores or rather
denies the rights of the men who have come up the long hard way of 
practical experience. The requirement of both diploma and examination 
is not a reasonable but is an unreasonable and an arbitrary
requirement. The right' to determine what requirements must be met
by the applicants' is qualified by the Constitutional provision
and the legislature has no power to overstep its limitations. The 
requirements must be reasonable and necessary to the ends designed.</p>

<p>if the language of the decision is to be taken as its sense it

<pb></pb>

means that the legislature is the ultimate judge of the reasonableness
of its requirements. It distinctly overrides the declaration 
of the supreme court of the United States in the many cases cited.</p>

<p>if that were true, the constitutional provision would have no
force. The legislature says it is reasonable-the constitution to 
the contrary and there is no power to overrule that decision?</p>

<p>Such is not the law. Of what force are constitutions if they 
can be thus ignored or overridebn?</p>

<p>Chief Justice Marshall long ago declared "The powers of the 
legislature are defined and limited, and that those limits
may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the Constitution is written. To what
purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose in that limitation
committed to writing if those limits may at any time be passed by 
those intended to be restrained? The distinction between government 
with limited and unlimited powers is abolished if those limits do not 
confine the persons on whom they are imposed and if acts forbidden 
and acts allowed are of equal obligation."
Marbury vs Madison 1 Cranch 137. (2 L.D. 60)</p>

<p>The Washington case is based on the decision of the California court
in Ex parte Whitely 77 Pac. 879, and that in turn upon Dent vs West
Virginia 129 U.S. 124. (32 L.D. 623). Examination of the latter 
case will show that the court was passing upon a very different
statute. The West Virginia Act provided that license should be
issued to three distance classes of persons;</p>

<p>1.- Those possessing diplomas from some dental college,
2.- Those who had resides and practiced in the state for ten years,
3.- Those who passed a satisfactory examination.</p>

<p>The possession of a diploma was one ground for the issue of a
license without examination; The fact of having practiced for ten years
in the state prior to the passage of the act, was a second ground,
and the possession of the requisite skill and knowledge as shown by
a satisfactory examination was a third ground. Under such a law,
no competent person was excluded. Here, no matter how skilled or
wise the applicant may be, no matter how long he has practiced or 
what wide experience he may possess, it all falls to nothing before
the right of the college graduate of 21 summers who possesses a 
diploma of graduation from some Dental College.</p>

<p>Not a singular case can be found in the books which bases its
support of such a law as we are here considering upon any stable or
<add>12</add>

satisfactory reason. None that cites a well reasoned and supporting
authority. We have examined with care the many cases cited by 
respondant here and none of them satisfies the reason or appeals to 
competent supporting authority. In fact, many of them are directly 
in support of our contentions.</p>

<p>The two cases which support respondents contention most directly
are the Thompson case in this state and Vandersluis case in
43 Minnesota. The latter case, like the former, simply begs the 
question and substitutes assertion for argument. It cites no 
supporting authority. Gothard vs People 15 Pac. is like it in its
want of argument or authority for its support. State Rl.Crandall vs
Mc Intosh 103 S.W. is a Missouri case and the point is entirely 
obiter. People vs Griswold, the recent N.Y. case, refers to the 
Smith case recently decided by the U.S. Supreme court but wholly
ignores its argument and authority. It is exactly contrary to the 
Smith case and is entitled to no consideration here.</p>

<p>In short, the only decisions that are at all in support of the 
respondents contentions are those of state courts passing upon their
own statutes. The tendency of such courts is to sustain their own 
statutes. It was to correct that vice that the Supreme Court of the 
United States was given jurisdiction in all cases under the Federal
constitutin and acts.</p>

<p>The clause of the Constitution in question is the most vital 
in the whole document. It was the answer of the people to the 
fallacious doctrine of State Rights. It cost hundreds of thousands 
of lives and millions of money to write it into the Constitution
and it has received more consideration from the Supreme Court than
any other clause of that important document.</p>

<p>A brief review of <add>some of</add> those decisions may be of value</p>

<p>Yick Wo vs Hopkins 118 U.S. 356 is a leading case upon this 
phase of the amendment. An ordinance of San Francisco prescribed
certain regulations for the construction of laundries and required
all to conform to them and further to obtain a license from the
board of supervisors, which license might be refused in the discretion
of the board. After complying with the requirements as to 
construction and having been denied a license such denial being based<add>13</add>
<pb></pb>

13.
upon the will or discretion of the Board, Yick Wo was convicted of 
violating the ordiannce and in reviewing the matter of the Supreme 
Court of the United States, speaking by Mr. Justice Matthews, said;</p>

<p>"The fourteenth amendment is not confined to citizens. It says,
'nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty of property
without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws'- These provisions are universal
in their apploication, to all persons within the territorial 
jurisdiction, without regard to any difference of race, or color or
of nationality; and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of 
the protection of EQUAL LAWS.</p>

<p>The ordinance is then held to be unjustly discriminatory and void.
The case is elementary and instructive.</p>

<p>In LOCHNER VS NEW YORK 198 U.S. 52 the question arose upon the 
statute of the state forbidding that any employee should be 
required or permitted to work more than 60 hours in one week. It was
held that this statute conflicted with the fourteenth amendment and
was void, the court saying;</p>

<p>"The general right of the individual to make a contract in relation
to his business is part of theliberty protected by the 14th 
amendment of the Federal Constitution. Under that provision no
stte can deprive any person of life, liberty or property without
due process of law. - - Both property and liberty are held on such 
reasonable condtions as may be imposed by the governing 
powers, and with such conditions the 14th amendment was designed not 
to interfere. - - In every case that comes before this court, therefore,
where legislation of this character is concerned, and where 
the protection of the Federal constitution is sought, the question
necesaarily arises; Is this a fair, reasonable and appropriate exercise
of the police power of the state, or is it an unreasonable,
unnecessary and arbitrary interferance with the right of the individual
to his personal liberty or to enter into those contracts in 
relation to labor which seem appropriate to him or necessary for the
support of himself and family? - - Is it within the police power 
of the state? That question must be answered by the courts.
The purpose of the statute must be determined from the natural and 
legal effect of the language employed, and whether it is or is not 
repugnant to the constitution of the United State must be determined
from the natural effect of such statutes when put in operation..
The court looks beyond the mere letter of the law in such cases."</p>

<p>In Toldeo W. and W. Ry. vs Jacksonville 67 III. 40, (cited with
approval in the Virginia Supreme Court in State vs Goodwill 6 L.R.
A. 622 it is said;</p>

<p>"It is not within the power of the legislature, under the pretense
of exercising the police powers of the state, to enat laws not necessary 
to the health and safety of the comunity, that will be 
oppressive and burdensome upon the citizen."</p>

<p>In State vs Goodwill 6 L.R.A. 622, the court says;</p>

<p>"The rights of every individual must stand or fail by the same
rule of law that governs every other members of the body poltic
under similar circumstances; and every partial or private law which
directly proposes to destroy or affet individual rights, or does
the same thing by restricting the privileges of certain classes of 
citizens and not of others when there is no public necessity for such 
discrimination, is unconstitutional and void."</p>

<p>Butchers Union etc. vs Crescent City 111 U.S. 746</p>

<p>"Generally it is for the legislature to determine what laws and
regulations are proper, in the exercise of the police power, but 
if it passes an act, ostensibly for the public health, and thereby
destroys or takes away the property of a citizen, or interferes with
his rights or personal liberty, then it is for the courts to determine
whether it is a proper and reasonable exercise of the power and 
if not, to declare it void.- -"</p>

<p>The rue pointing to the true test of such laws is well stated
by Justice Field in Hing vs Crowley 113 U.S. 703. viz;</p>

<p>"The discriminations which are open to objection are those where 
persons engaged in the same business are subjected to different 
restrictions or are held to different privileges under the same conditions,;
it is only then that the discrimination can be said to 
impair that equal right which all can claim in the enforcement of 
the laws."</p>

<p>BARBIER VS CONNOLLY 113 U.S. 27 reasserts these principles.</p>

<p>The 14th amendment - - undoubtedly intended, not only that
these should be no arbitrary deprivation of life, liberty or property,
but that equal protection and security should be given to all
under like circumstances in the enjoyment of their personal and civil
rights; that all persons should be equally entitled to pursue their 
happiness and acquire and enjoy property; - - that no impediment 
should be imposed to the pursuits of any one except as applied to
the same pursuits by others under like circumstances' that no greer
burdens should be laid upon ine, than are laid upon others in the 
same calling and condition."</p>

<p>HENNINGTON VS STATE OF GEORGIA 163 U.S. 300.</p>

<p>"The well settled rule is, that if a statute purporting to 
have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals 
or the public safety HAS NO REAL OR SUBSTANTIAL RELATION TO THOSE 
OBJECTS or is a palpable invasions of rights secured by fundamental law
it is the duty of the court to so adjudge and thereby give effect

<p>The Courst said;
"The law cannot discriminatae in favor of one citizen to the
detriment of another. The principle of equality pervades the entire
Constitution. The Bill of Rights declares expressly that all 
government is instituted for the general good, for the common benefit
protection and security of the whole community, and not for the<add>16</add>

interests or emolument of any one man, family or class of men; that
eveyy ember of the community has a right to be protected by it in
the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property. No one citizen
or class of citizens can by law be charged with the performance of 
duties or be subjected to burdens not by law made incumbent upon all
other citizens in the same circumstances. (Missouri vs Lewis 101 U.S.
22; Barbier vs Connolly 113 U.S. 31; Yick Wo. vs Hopkins 118 U.S. 
3562) (The objection is that) ' of those physicians who are declared by
statue, or under its provisions, are found; qualified to practice,
some are and some are not subjected to the burden of obtaining a 
license. Exemption from that burden is made to depend, not on integrity,
education and medical skill, but upon a continuous dwelling
in one place for (at) a certain time. It is arbitrary discrimination
permitting some and forbidding others to carry on their business 
without regard to their competency or to any material difference 
in their situation. The test is not merity but unchanged residence.
For the right to continue the pursuit of his profession one
physician is not while another, his neigbor, who may be his equal or 
superior in learning, experience, and ability, is, required to pay 
$5.00. This is not the equality of the Constitution. The magnitude
of the unequal burden is immaterial. If any inequality is permitted
the discrimination might be made prohibitory and a monopoly
of business giben to physicians who have resided in a town or city
of business given to physicians who have resided in a town or city for 
a specified time." State vs Express Co. Go N.H. 219
State vs Hinmna 18 Atl. 194.</p>

<p>CHICAGO M &amp; ST P RY VS WESTBY 47 L.R.A.(NS) 97 is closely in
point. The law of the state imposed certain burdens upon common
carriers, in respect to negligence, not imposed upon other employers
under like circumstances. The U.S.C.C.A. per judge Sanborn, 
exhaustively reviews the authorities and lays down the rule governing
the right of classification at attempted by the legislature.</p>

<p>""There must be such a difference between the situation and
circumstances of all members of the class and the situation and 
circumstances of all other members of the state in relation to the 
subjects of the discriminatory legislation as presents a just, natural
reason for the difference made in their liabilities and burdens, and
in their rights and privileges.</p>

<p>"All who are in a situation and circumstances relative t othe
subjects of the discriminatory regulation indistinguishable from
those members of the class must be brought under the influence of the 
law and treated by it in the same way as are the members of the 
class."</p>

<p>"But the members of these classes may not be selected arbitrarily
without just or sound reasons inyherently in their respective situations
and circumstances relative to the subject matter of the legislation
for the difference in the burdens imposed and privileges conferred
upon them by such discrimnatory law."</p>

<p>"While reasonable classification is permitted, without doing
violence to the equal protection of the laws, such classifcation
must be based upon some real and substantial distinction, bearing a
reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which such
classification is imposed; and classification cannot e arbitrarily 
made without any substantial basis. Arbitrary selection cannot be
made by calling it classification."</p>

<p>BONNETT VS VALLIER 17 L.R.A. (NS) 491, a Wisconsin case is

unreasonable and un unnecessary interferance with the rights of the 
individual.</p>

<p>"The right to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is 
accured to everyone under the constitution of Massachusetts. This 
includes the right to pursue any proper vocation to obtain a livelihood.
Substantially the same right is secured also by the Constitution 
of the United States which does not permit any state to
deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process
of law. The nature of this right has been stated and illustrated in
many cases. (Citing) There is no doubt that the refusal to permit 
anyone to engage in the business of an undertaker is a violation of 
this right, unless there is some good reason for the refusal."</p>

<p>PEOPLE VS SCHENK 44 L.R.A (NS) 48 is also in point.</p>

<p>CONNOLLY VS UNION SEWER PIPE CO. 184 U.S. 554 likewise sustains
the principles we conted for.</p>

<p>But the case of SMITH VS TEXAS 233 U.S. 630 is the case which
we insist is mot closely analagous to and controls the case at bar</p>

<p>The state of Texas had passed a statute requiring that no person
should be appointed Conductor of a freight train unless he had 
previously served two years a brakeman on a freight train. An engineer
who had also served as a passenger conductor, was so appointed and 
on arrest and conviction for violation of this statute, the case was 
reviewed by the Supreme Court of the United States. The case is 
exhaustively briefed and is the very latest pronouncement upon the 
question at bar and from a controlling authority. It readily 
appears that the highest court in the land has become more and more
alive to the necessity of opposing the tendency to legislate for the 
benefit of particuclar classes and to circumscribe with the 
constitutional provision the acts of the states in alleged exercise of
their police power. Justice Lamar says;</p>

<p>Life, liberty and property and the equal protection of the law, 
grouped together int e constitution, are so related that the 
deprivation of any one of those seperate and independent rights may 
lessen or extinguish the value of the other three. In so far as a man is
deprived of his right to labor, his liberty is restrited, his capacity
to earn wages and acquire property is lessened and he is dened
the protection of the law afforded to those who are permitted 
to work. Liberty means more than freedom from servitude, and the 
constitutionnal guaranty is an assurance that the ccitizen shall be protected
in the right to use his powers of mind and body in any lawful <add>18</add>

calling. - - If the service is public, the state may prescribe
qualifications and require an examination to test the fitness of 
any person to engage in or remain in the public service. ---</p>

<p>But as the public interest is the basis of such legislation, the 
tests and prohibition should be enacted witg reference to that 
obhect, and so as not unduly to interfere with private business or 
impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon lawful occupations.
Lawton vs Steele 152 U.S. 137. -- The necessity of avoiding the 
fixing of arbitrary tests by which competent persons would be 
excluded from lawful employment, is also recognized in Smith vs Alabama
124 U.S. 465-480 -- The liberty of contract is, of course, not
unlimited; but there is no reason or authority for the proposition
that conditions may be imposed by statute which will admit some
who are competent and arbitrarily exclude others who are equally competent
to labor on terms mutually satisfactory to employer and employee.
none of the cases sustains the propostion that under the
power to secure public safety, a privileged class can be created an 
be then given a monopoly of the right to work in a special or favored
position. Such a statute would shut the door, without a hearing
upon many persons and classes of persons who were competent to serve
and would deprive them of the liberty to work in a calling they were
qualified to fill with safety to the public and benefit to themselves."</p>

<p>This case seems to clearly and fully in every principle sustain
our contentions.</p>

<p>Not only is it ably reasoned, but it is considering a law enacted
in pursuance of the same police power and prescribing equally 
unnecessary tests and excluding equally competent persons by reason 
of its provisions from earning their daily bread by their lawful
calling.</p>

<p>Numerous cases could be added wherein the same principles have 
been enunciated but enough have been cited to show the clear and 
established trend of authority in the highest court of the land and 
wherever the same subject has received the consideratio of thoughtful
minds.</p>

<p>To say that the boy or girl who is fresh from the dental college 
of some other state should have privileges of examination not granted
to well qualified men of long practice and acquired learning in the 
profession, is to deny to the latter the protection of equal laws.</p>

<p>It is unjust and unlawful discrimination. It does not tend to
nor even remotely benefit the public, but it a bane rather than a
blessing. Who would employ the youthful graduate in preference to
the dentist of 27 years experience, fully equipped with the learning of
years and up to the standard of the day?</p>

<p>Petitioner has acquired his skill and knowledge by the way recognized

profession. By that profession he must maintain himself and his
family. What public necessity is there which requires that he and 
others of his class must now waste years of time in passing through 
a dental college tog e a diploma in order to entitle him and them to
show to a competent Board that they know the details and requirements
of their profession? There was not public outcry for such a
law. It repealed a better law than it presents to the state. If its
design was to regulate the ‘owning and managing’ of dental offices
it fell wide of the mark.? It repealed the fixed standar to which 
applicants were required to comply and substituted a ‘satisfactory’
and hence an arbitrary examination- the opinion of an arbitrary
body- as such standard. It was too evidently enacted in the interest
of the established dentists and not of the general public and
it should be held void.</p>

<p>Of the jurisdiction of this court there can be no question.
Ex Parte Siebold 100 U.S. 371 404
Royal vs Royal 117 U.S. 241
In Re Albert White 43 Fed. 913</p>

<p>We submit that the language of Tiedman on Police Power quotes
early in this argument, is most appropriate to this case</p>

<p>“Any prohibition which extends further than to prevent the admission
of incompetent persons, will be ‘unconstitutional”.</p>

<p>If a college education is to be made the sole test of the right
to an examination for fitness, in dentistry, why not in law? or in
any of the other professions? Is the college graduate to be placed
upon a pedestal in an exalted class by himself and granted privileges 
denied to the man of years who has attained far greater skill and
knowledge by the arduous pathway of experience?</p>

<p>Abraham Licnoln, by such a test, would have been debarred from
practice. John Marshall would never have been a justice of the
Supreme Court. Many a man who is or has been a shining light in
the fields of law, medicine and dentistry would have been excluded
in favor of the adolescent graduate with his diploma.</p>

<p>It is not the diploma but the knowledge and skill which it evidences
which protects the public. He who has that knowledge and
skill, no matter how or where acquired, is equally entitled to the

<pb/>

protection of the law in the pursuit of his chosen avocation.</p>

<p>To deny him is to refuse him that equal and exact justice which 
it was the aim and purpose of the Constitution to secure.</p>
