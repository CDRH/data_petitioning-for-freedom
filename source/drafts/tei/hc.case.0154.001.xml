<p>That none of defendants
counsel have ever inquired 
of me concerning
the testimony of said
witnesses or their knowledge 
of the facts, stating
to the killing of James
Finch. That if they or
either of them had done
so, applicant would have
given them such information 
as he possessed concerning 
the same, or would
have made such sounsel
of defendant acquainted 
with said wintesses
and given them an opportunity 
to inquire of
said witnesses conerning 
the same. That
applicant is now ready
and willing to make defendants 
counsel acquainted 
with said witnesses
to the end that they
may <del>become</del> inquire
of said witnesses of their
knowledge of the facts
relating to the killing
of said Finch, to the
end that they may
become informed thereof.

Affiant further deposes and
says: That it is not true
that strong prejudice and
great excitement exists
against defendant in Spokane 
county and affiant
further avows that the
defendant can have a
fair just and impartial
trial at this term of court;
and in support of this
statement affiant submits
the affidavits heretofore
filed in this action by
the Territory, upon the
application of defendant
for a change of venue,
and makes said affidavits 
a post of this showing.</p>

<p>Affiant further saith
that he is acquainted with
Charles Wilson mentioned
in affidavit of Ray
Raymond, that he said
Wilson has been present
in Spokane Falls up to
the last three or four
days. That said Wilson
and said Ray Raymond
are, as affiant is informed
and verily believes, acquainted 

<pb/>

with said Ray 
Raymons, and that
he has often concerned
with her, and in all
probability has often conversed 
with her concerning 
the facts in this.
That said Charles Wilson
has up to within a short
time ago been a hackion 
in this city.</p>
