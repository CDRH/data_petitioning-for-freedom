<p>Territory of Washington<lb/>
County of Spokane} ss</p>

<p>In the District
Court, Fourth Judicial 
District
holding terms at
Spokane Falls.</p>

<p>The Territory of Washington<lb/>
vs.<lb/>
Ray Raymond</p>

<p>W.A. Sandars being duly 
sworn on his oath deposes
and says: That he now is
and for the past Thirteen
years has been a resident 
of the precinct of
Spangle in Spokane County
Washington Territory. That
he is well acquainted
with the people of said
precinct and has personal
acquaintance with a large
share of them. That he is
engaged in the mercantile 
business in said precinct.</p>

<p>Said applicant further avers
that he has been informed
of the above entitled action

<pb/>

for some time and knows
the same is now pending
in our said court.</p>

<p>Applicant further avers
that he has never heard
any expressions of prejudice 
against Ray Raymond
by the people of said
precinct of Spangle and
he believes that if such
prejudice existed he would
have heard the same.
Affiant further avers that
he has never heard 
the said cause much discussed 
by the people 
of said precinct and
what discussion there
was been was principally
 at the time of the
homicide. That affiant
believes that the majority
of the people of Spangle
precinct are not acquainted 
with the alleged
facts in said case
and have formed no
opinion as to the guilt
or innocence of the
defendant in their action. 
Affiant further
says that there are

<pb/>

about four hundred
people living in said
precinct, and that
affiant verily believes
a hundred jury men
could be summoned from
said Spangle precinct
qualified by law to
serve as jurors in said
above named action and
who are not prejudiced
against the defendant
in said action, and
who have not heard
the alleged facts relating
there to, and have formed
no opinion as to the
guilt or innocence of
said defendant and
further affiant saith 
not.</p>

<p>Wm. A. Sanders</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn
to before me this 10th
day of December A.D.
1886.</p>

Notary Public</p>
