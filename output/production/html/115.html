    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Arthur alleged that Richard, the child, had been in his custody from January 1, 1901 until August 15, 1903. At that time, Richard was left with the Child Saving Institute, by May Moraine, wife of Arthur, for two weeks and at the end of the two weeks, she would determine whether she would permit the child to be adopted. On August 21, 1905, Arthur and May went to the Institute to reclaim their child where they were informed that the child had been sent out for a six month trial by some parents who desired to adopt the child. The petition was granted and was directed to the respondents, Anderson W. Clark, John Doe, and Nellie Reed. Richard Moraine was not found in their custody or in the state of Nebraska. </li>
