    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In early November 1899, Samuel Morgan, a soldier imprisoned at Fort Crook to await trial for desertion, assaulted his guard and escaped to the nearby town of La Platte. A sergeant ordered two enlisted men, John Fair and Henry Jockens, to track down Morgan, order him to halt twice, and to shoot him if he did not comply, which is what they did. Morgan died from his wound after five minutes. Fair and Jockens were court-martialed and found not guilty of manslaughter. One month later, the pair were arrested and charged with murder under Nebraska law in the Sarpy County District Court. In January 1900, Fair and Jockens petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, arguing, among other things, that Nebraska lacked the jurisdiction to try them and that they were just following orders. After hearing the evidence, they were released from custody. Nebraska declared that it would appeal and bail was set at $1,000 apiece. However, the state dropped the appeal later that year and Fair and Jockens successfully petitioned to have their bail discharged.

It is worth noting that Judge William Munger commented directly on habeas corpus law in his opinion, saying: "I am mindful of the rule of law that in a habeas corpus proceeding the Court will not examine the evidence for the purpose of determining whether the party should be pronounced guilty or innocent of the offense for which he is imprisoned; yet in a case of this character it is not only proper, but necessary, for the Court to determine whether the parties acted wantonly and with criminal intent, or whether their acts, though wrongful, were errors of judgment only."</li>
