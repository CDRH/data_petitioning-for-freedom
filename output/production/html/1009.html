    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 21st, 1917, Harry Davis and Morris (or George) Meyer stole 161 men's suits from Moon Clothing Co. in Onawa, Iowa. The duo stashed their stolen goods at the house of Frank Kellerman at 2636 Franklin Street in Omaha, Nebraska. While several men witnessed the pair of thieves store the boxes in the basement, no one knew what the two were scheming, and the burglars refused to disclose what they had in the boxes. Davis and Morris attempted to sell their products to Max Sundheiner, a local merchant; however, Sundheimer refused to purchase the goods as he was suspicious of how the suits had been acquired. He tipped off the police and distanced himself from the two men. 

Sometime between the heist and September 6th of the same year, Davis and Morris were caught by the Omaha police and detained under an arrest order issued by the Governor of Nebraska in compliance with a request from the Governor of Iowa. The two burglars each filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus. Morris argued that he had not left Omaha, Nebraska, for over twenty years, which, in turn, would have made his involvement in the heist impossible. He also claimed that because the executive warrant for his arrest was issued without any prior investigation, his arrest was unconstitutional as both a Nebraska and US citizen. The judge, however, did not agree with his argument and denied his writ of Habeas Corpus. 

Meyer and his attorney attempted to appeal the case in the Supreme Court of Nebraska following their defeat. The appeal was permitted, and the petitioning party began to work on their case. They were granted an extension in March of 1918 to prepare and file Bill of Exceptions. Despite their efforts and nearly two years of being on trial, the Supreme Court of Nebraska ruled against Morris on April 15th, 1919, and affirmed the decision of the lower court. Morris remained in custody for his crime. </li>
