    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On February 10th, 1923, H.S. Lover filed a petition on behalf of his client Frank Monroe, claiming that Frank was unlawfully detained in the county jail by Michael Endres. The judge allowed the petition, and issued the writ to Michael Endres, "commanding him [Endres] to release said Frank H. Monroe from custody upon giving bond in the sum of $100." On February 14th, Lover filed a subpoena requesting the presence of Irvin Stalmaster (Deputy County Attorney) as a witness on behalf of Frank Monroe. On February 15th, Lover submitted an amended petition. This amended petition explained that Frank had been arrested and charged with assault. In court, he had entered a plea of not guilty but the court record a plea of guilty instead. Frank and his lawyer claimed that this was done unlawfully, wrongfully, and without jurisdiction. As a result of this guilty plea, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail. Frank also alleged that at the time of the hearing, he advised the court that he had employed counsel and requested that he be given sufficient time for his counsel to appear. Frank alleged that the court refused to grant him sufficient time for his counsel to be present. Frank requested that the court fix a bail bond in such a sum they deemed appropriate, that they should correct the record of his plea, and that he be granted the chance to appeal. Frank alleged that the court refused to fix the amount of bail or to correct the record, which prevented him from being able to submit an appeal. Michael Endres submitted a return to the writ. The dates of what Endres described were not filled in on the return. But, Endres claimed that, firstly, Frank was released on his own recognizance. He then explained that his authority for detaining Frank in the first place came from a mittimus from Judge Frank Dineen after Frank was sentenced to 90 days after being found guilty of assault. On February 17th, the writ was allowed. Frank Monroe was released from custody and his bond was exonerated.</li>
