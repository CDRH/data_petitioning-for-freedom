<p> In the Matter of the 
application of Francis Stephen Medcraf
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>Brief For Petitioner.</p>

<p>MR GEO. D. EMERY, for the Petitioner</p>

<p>THE PETITIONER was charged and conviced before a Justice of the
Peace with the 'crime' of practicing dentistry without a certificate'
contrary to the provisions of the Dental Code of Washington.</p>

<p>Having been committed to prison under this conviction he brings
this proceeding to enquire into the lawfulness of the imprisonment.</p>

<p>He alleges that the statute under which these proceedings were 
had and the conviction was entered is void because in conflict with 
the provisions of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, in that he is deprived of his liberty and property
without due process of law and that the Act in question denys to him
(a person within the jurisdiction of the State) the 'equal protection
of the laws'.</p>

<p>The amendment in question provides,
"nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or 
property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protectoin of the laws."</p>

<p>Sec. 1977 of the Comp. Laws of the U.S. guarantees equal rights
under the law to all 'persons' within the jurisdiction of the States
and under the laws of every state. Such 'persons' shall have the 
right "in every state and territory- - to the full and equal benefit
of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property"</p>

<p>The citizenship of the 'person' is therefore of no consequence.
The pledge of 'equal protection of the laws' is a pledge of the 
protection of 'equal' laws. <add>Yick Wo vs Hopkins 118 U.S. 356.</add></p>

<p>THE FIRST DENTAL CODE of Washington is found in Hills Statutes
& Codes of Wash. Sec. 2854 et seq. being the Act of Jany 1888.</p>

<add>1</add>

<pb></pb>

<p>It provides;
"--it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the 
practice of dentistry in the state of Washington, unless said 
person has graduated and received a diploma from the faculty of a dental 
college chartered under the authority of some one of the United
States or foreign governments, or shall have obtained a certificate
from a board of dentists duly authorized and appointed by the 
provisions of this chapter to issue such certificates."</p>

<p>A board of 5 dentists is provides for to be appointed by
the Governor who are to be "practicing dentists" and take an oath 
of office.</p>

<p>Persons practicing dentistry in the state at the passage of
the Act must enroll their names with the Board within 3 months and 
shall thereupon-without examination- receive a certificate as a 
practitioner of dentistry within the state.</p>

<p>All others desiring to practice dentistry must submit to an 
examination before the Board and must show the posession of skill in
dental surgery 'satisfactory to said Board', and shall thereupon
receive such certificate to practice.</p>

<p>IN 1893 this law was amended; The new act provided for
A slight change in the system of appontents of the Board.</p>

<p>Examination of those desiring to practice dentistry in the 
state, prescribing a standard of qualifications and requiring that 
"no person shall be eligible for such examination unless he or she
shall be of good moral character and shall present to said board his
or her diploma from some dental college in good standing and shall
give satisfactory evidence of his or her rightful possession of the 
same; PROVIDED, That the said Board may admit to examination such
other persons of good moral character as shall give satisfactory evidence
of having been engaged in the practice of dentistry ten years
prior to the date of the application for examination."</p>

<p>All persons authorized to practice under the former law and 
still engaged in practice are to be enrolled and licensed without 
further examination.</p>

<p>Students enrolled in a regular dental college and studying
in a licensed dentists office in the state are exempted from the 
penal provisions and might practice under their preceptor.</p>

<p>(N.B. There was then, as now, no 'dental college' in the State
so the regular attendance thereon required by the act was of no 
value or efffect in fact)</p>

<p>IN 1901 this law materially amended and all its provisions
inconsistent with the new act were repealed. This act is Chap 152 of
the Laws of 1901. Section 4 of this act provides;</p>

<p>"Any person or persons seeking to practice dentistry in the state
of Washington, or to own, operate or cause to be operated or run,
or manage a dental office or place for the practice of dentistry in
the State of Washington, after the passage of this Act, shall file
his or her name, together with an application for examination, with

<add>2</add>

<pb></pb>

the Secretary of the State Board of Dental Examiners at the time
of making such application, shall pay to the secretary of such Board
a fee of twnty-five dollars nd present him or herself at the first
regular meeting thereafter of said Board to undergo examination 
before that body.</p>

<p>No person shall be eligible for such examination unless he or
she shall present to said Board his or her diploma from some Dental
College in good standing and shall give satisfactory evidence of his 
or her rightful possession of the same; PROVIDED, this section shall
not apply to persons engaged in the practice of dentistry at the 
time of the passage of this act who are bona fide citizens of the 
State of Washington."</p>

<p>Provision is made for the issue of licence or certificate to the 
successful applicant and for recording such certificate and the practice
without such record of dentistry is made penal under fine of
$50.00 to $200.00 or imprisonment in the County Jail for not more
than six months.</p>

<p>It appears by the record that the state Board of Dental Examiners 
employed one Conover to go the office of petitioner and secure
his professional services to remove two decayed teeth and paid him
therefor. Thereupon Conver - by direction of the Board - filed a 
complaint with the Justice, secured a warrant thereon and the arrest 
of petitoner for 'practicing dentistry without having a certificate
of admission to practice recorded with the County Auditor', contrary
to said Act. <add>(State Board Prosecuting Case)</add></p>

<p>Upon the trial, petitioner duly raised all the constitutional
questions here presented but his objections being overruled, the
evidence was taken. It thereby appeared that petitioner had served
five years as an apprentice to a competent and reuptable dentists in
London, Eng; had continuously thereafter practiced dentistry in the 
employ of competent dentists in England, France and Greece for 8
years: thereafter continued suchc practiced for himself in London, 
Canada and the United States for 7 years and thereafter in Seattle for 
7 years, making a continuous practice of 27 years-including his
apprenticeship. That he had, before commencing practice in Seattle,
duly applied to the said Board of Dental Examiners, tendered the fee
and requested and appeared for examination but such examination was
refused on the ground that petititoner had no diploma from a dental
college. Whereupon and for that reason a certificate and licence 
were refused. His conviction and sentence followed.</p>
