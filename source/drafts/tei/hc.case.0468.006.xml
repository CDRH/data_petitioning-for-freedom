IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON,
NORTHERN DIVISION.

In the Matter of the Application
of John W. Considine, for a Writ 
of Habeas Corpus.

OPINION.
Filed October 20, 1897.

Harrison Bostwick, For Petitioner.

Patrick Henry Winston,
Attorney General,
For Respondent.

HANFORD, District Judge:-

The application for a 
writ of habeas corpus in this case presents for decision the question
whether the following statute of the State of Washington is
repugnant to the Constitution of the United States:

"No female person shall be employed in any capacity in any
saloon, beer hall, bar room, theatre, or place of amusement, where
intoxicating liquors are sold as a beverage, and any person or
corporation convicted of so employing, or of participating in so
employing, any such female person shall be fined not less than five
hundred dollars; and any person so convicted may be imprisoned in
the county jail for a period of not less than six months."
(Laws Wash. 1895, p. 177.)

The petitioner was convicted in the Superior Court for Spokane
County, of a violation of this statute, and the judgment against him
has been affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State of Washington;
State v. Considine, 16 Wash. 358-365; 47 Pac. Rep. 755. After the
judgment of the Supreme Court had been rendered, and the petition
for a rehearing denied, he filed his petition herein, for a writ of
habeas corpus, alleging that he was unlawfully imprisoned under said
judgment, for non-payment of the fine imposed.

This court has no jurisdiction to review decisions of the
Supreme Court of the State, upon questions of procedure in the
State courts under State laws, or questions involving the interpretation
or application of the provisions of the State Constitution,
therefore, I will only say in answer to the argument of counsel for

<pb/>

the petitioner, as to those questions, that the decision of the
Supreme Court of the State is final and conclusive.

The contention of the petitioner is, that in contravention of
the provisions of the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the
United States, the statute under which he was convicted, does
abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United
States; and does deny to persons within the jurisdiction of this
State the equal protection of the laws in this, that it deprives
persons lawfully engaged in the liquor business, of the privilege
or right of employing women who are competent to contract with
reference to their own services; and in this, that it deprives
women of freedom in their choice of vocations, and makes it unlawful
for them to engage in employment which is lawful for men.

In the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, by
Chief Justice Fuller, in the case of Giozza v. Tiernan, 148 U.S.
657-662, it is declared that:

"The amendment does not take from the States those powers of
police that were reserved at the time the original Constitution was
adopted. Undoubtedly it forbids any arbitrary deprivation of life,
liberty or property, and secures equal protection to all under like
circumstances in the enjoyment of their rights; but it was not designed
to interfere with the power of the State to protect the lives
liberty and property of its citizens, and to promote their health,
morals, education and good order. Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U. S. 
27, 31; In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436."

The following paragraph from the opinion of the Supreme Court
by Mr. Justice Harlan, in the case of Plumley v. Massachusetts, 155
U. S. 461-482, also bears directly upon the question in this case:

"We are not unmindful of the fact-- indeed, this court has
often had occasion to observe-- that the acknowledged power of the
States to protect the morals, the health, and safety of their people
by appropriate legislation, sometimes touches, in its exercise, the
line separating the respective domains of national and state authority.
But in view of the complex system of government which exists
in this country, "presenting," as this court, speaking by Chief
Justice Marshall, has said, "the rare and difficult scheme of one
general government, whose action extends over the whole, but which
possesses only certain enumerated powers, and of numerous state
governments, which ratain and exercise all powers not delegated to
the Union," the judiciary of the United States should not strike
down a legislative enactment of a State-- especially if it has 
direct connection with the social order, the health, and the morals
of its people-- unless such legislation plainly and palpably 

<pb/>

violates some right granted or secured by the national Constitution or
encroaches upon the authority delegated to the United States for
the attainment of objects of national concern."

This statute is general in its scope, and applies equally to 
all persons similarly situated; it is not therefore, in any sense
partial or arbitrary. It was not enacted to do injury or work
injustice. On the contrary, the intent of the legislature is manifest
to check the tendency towards immorality of the association
of the sexes in places of resort, where intoxicating beverages are
sold, and where the worst passions are aroused.

It is true that the statute does not appear to be aimed in the
most direct manner at the evil tendencies of association of the 
sexes in drinking places. Criminaity under the statute, consists
in the employment of female persons in such places, and it forbids
the employment of women for any service, going to the extent of
forbidding the engagement of actresses in theatres wherein liquor
is sold, although the players may have nothing whatever to do with
the business of serving drinks, and a ppint is made by petitioner
that the legislature has failed to touch the evil thing, for there
is no prohibition in the law against women resorting to such places,
or consorting with men therein. This criticism appears to be just,
and yet it may be said in defense of the law, that it has been
customary from time immemorial, for legislatures, in enacting new
laws, to have in mind existing and known evils, and to construct
statutes with reference to particular forms of wrong doing which
have attracted public attention. There can be no doubt that this
statute was contrived because the particular resorts where barmaids
and box-ruslers find regular employment, and may be found in
habitual attendance, have offended the moral sensabilities of the
people. If, in its result, the statute does not effect the reformation
intended, it is for the legislature to consider whether it
will enact a more drastic law.

But the constitutionally of a law is not to be tested by
questioning its efficacy. Whether well designed to accomplish the

<pb/>

purpose intended, or otherwise, the law is a police regulation, and
clearly within the poice power of the State, which has not been
taken away by the 14th amendment.

Petition denied.

C. H. Hanford

Judge.
