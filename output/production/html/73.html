    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On July 29, 1920, Anna Citta crafted a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of her infant daughter, Francis Citta. According to Anna, Louis Citta, her husband, was unlawfully holding and keeping Francis Citta after having kidnapped her on July 29. In a separate 1920 lawsuit, Anna had also accused Frank of being an alcoholic. Louis Citta was ordered by the court to present Francis Citta in front of Judge Aruthur Wakely at the Douglas County District Court. The case was dismissed for want of prosecution on January 26, 1922 after Louis gave Anna their daughter back, said that he was "only joking," and promised to never be cruel to her again. However, the 1930 census shows Louis, Anna, and Frances living together again with two new children.</li>
