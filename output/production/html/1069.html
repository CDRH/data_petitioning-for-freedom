    <li>Summary of Proceedings: C. E. Clay was arrested and tried on police court under an order of mittimus issued July 16, 1918, by police magistrate James M. Fitzgerald, for unlawful possession and transport of intoxicating liquor. Clay was found guilty and charged $100 and costs of prosecution. On August 22, 1918, Clay, with attorney Ed F. Morearty, filed a petition of habeas against sheriff, Michael L. Clark. Clay charged that he had served 37 days in jail, and on day 21, attempted to pay remaining balance of fine, which was refused by Clark. The petition was granted, a writ was issued and sustained; Clay was discharged on August 28.</li>
