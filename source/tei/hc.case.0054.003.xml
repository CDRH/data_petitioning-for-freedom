and for said County and by the said Justice committed to the said County Jail without bail or main-
<unclear>prize</unclear> as a fugitive slave, and without hearing any 
testimony on the said 25th day of May 1853 - where 
he has been confined ever since and is still confined

attached marked A. and made a part of this 
petition</p>
