Consuls Wanted on Puget Sound.

Our Washington Territory correspondent, calls attention to the need that exists for the presence of foreign Consuls on Puget Sound. The lumber trade there is becoming more extensive every year, and the number of foreign vessels that go there direct from their home ports is also increasing. San Francisco is not sufficiently near for her Consulates to be available in disputes occuring on the Sound; and many of the vessels that load there do not visit this port at all. Much inconvenience has arisen, and considerable loss of property and time has been incurred heretofore through the need of Consuls at Puget Sound. Disputes are constantly occurring between sailors and captains, and between captains and consignees, which cannot be properly adjusted without consular intervention; and the result is that captains often find it impossible to compel their hands to observe contracts, while the men are exposed to injustice from dishonest masteres, and neither captains nor consignees can secure each other's fidelity. There are many French, Italian, and Chilian vessels now engaged in the lumber trade besides English. The people of South America, France, etc., from the great difficulty of the difference in their language, probably experience most inconvenience; but even in the case of British vessels, it has become so notorious that several of the leading merchants of Victoria have petitioned the Home Government to appoint a Vice-Consul for PUget Sound. The Consuls of other foreign Governments might take the hint, and procure such provisions from their superiors as would abate the evil complained of.&#8212;<hi rend="italic">S. F. Times.</hi>
