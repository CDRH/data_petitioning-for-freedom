<p>United States District Court
Western District of Washington
Northern Division.</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application
of Chin Hing for a Writ of
Habeas Corpus } No. 2857.
May 11, 1915.</p>
<p>Beeler &amp; Sullivan For Applicant</p>
<p>Clay Allen, U.S. District Attorney
George P. Fishburne, Asst. U.S. " } For Government</p>
<p>Neterer, District Judge:</p>
<p>The petitioner alleges in substance that he arrived at
the port of Seattle on the 15th of August, 1914, and applied
for admission; that he was given a hearing and examination before 
the Immigration officers, and on the 27th of August, 1914,
an order was issued by the Commissioner of Immigration at Seattle,
denying admission and ordering his deportation; that an appeal
was prosecuted to the Secretary of Labor, and that on September 
26, 1914, the order of deportation was confirmed; that his appeal
was determined by J.B. Denamore, the solicitor of the Department
of Labor, and not by the Secretary of Labor, or the Assistant
Secretary of Labor, each of whom, at the time of the determination
of said appeal, was at his respective office in the City of
Washington, and that the determination of his appeal by another 
not authorized is not a fair hearing and does not accord to him
due process of law. By further supplemental or amended petition
filed on the 25th of January, 1915, petitioner states that he
was denied the right of counsel to present his appeal before the
Secretary of Labor, was was deprived of a fair hearing. A return 
was made to the writ issued upon the petition, in which it is
admitted that the petitioner was ordered to be deported after a 
fair hearing and a denial that the appeal was not determined by
the proper officers, or that any rights have been withheld from
the petitioner. Upon the return day it was stipulated between
George P. Fishburne, Assistant United States District Attorney,
and the attorneys for the petitoner, that the deportations of
<fw>-1-</fw>
<pb/>
Lewis F. Post, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Labor,
and Cory M. Staden, both of Washington, D.C., should be taken
before Thomas G. Lewis, a Notary Public, of Washington, D.C. 
Thereupon the said Thomas G. Lewis was appointed Commissioner 
to take the depositions of the witnesses named. The witnesses
declined to testify because the answer might be prejudicial to
the public interest, and a rule was issued by Justice Gould
of the Supreme Court of the District of COlumbia, returnable
November 14, 1914, directed to Lewis F. Post, Assistant Secretary
of Labor, requiring him to show cause why he should not
answer certain questions propounded to him pursuant to the said
Commission. On the 13th day of November, 1914, the Secretary
of Commerce and Labor examined the appeal of the petitioner
herein and confirmed the decision heretofore rendered by the
"Acting Secretary" J.B. Denamore, and the decision and order
of deportation of the commissioner of Immigration. On the 25th 
of April a further return was made to the amended petition in
which all of the admission are made as in the original return,
and the further statement that the petitioner had appealed from
the decision of the Commissioner to the Secretary of the Department
of Labor, and that the said Secretary, after due consideration,
had confirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Immigration
in the manner provided by law. On the 5th of April,
1915, was filed a petition by the Assistant United States District
Attorney, requesting that the order entered pursuant to
stipulation on the 20th of October, 1914, for the taking of the
testimony of Lewis F. Post, Assistant Secretary of Labor, be 
recalled, for the reason that ont he 13th of November, 1914,
the Secretary of Labor had personally reviewed the record and
affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Immigration, Objection
is made to this petition, and also to the amended or supplemental
return, and it is urged taht the court should not permit
to be filed or to consider upon this hearing the decision of the
Secretary of Labor rendered since the insuguration of this proceeding
<fw>--2--</fw>
<pb/>
but that the matter should be heard and determined upon the
record as it existed at the time of the filing of the petition.</p>
<p>I do not think that the position of counsel for the petitoner
is tenable. It is highly technical, and not lead
to any conclusion of the rights of the petitoner in this controversy.
The petitioner in this case could not hope to be released
from custody and permitted to unlawfully enter the United States
while his appeal was pending before the Secretary of Labor. If
the contention is correct that the "Acting Secretary" was not
clothed with authority by reason of the persence of his superiors
qualified to act, then the appeal had not been heard and the
threatened deporation of the petitioner was simply permature, and
the most that the petitoner could hope for would be a delay of
the deporation untilt he proper officer of the department could
determine his appeal. The record discloses that the Secretary
of Labor did personally determine this appeal and adversely to
the petitoner. The Secretary of Labor having acted, the reason
for the disclosure sought by the deposition and interrogatories
of the Assistant Secretary of Labor is disposed of. There is
nothing at issue, and I think the Commission to take the said
deposition should be recalled. Courts are not organized to do
the respective parties the rights as law or equity may direct.
The entire record now being before the court, the court should
consider the record now and determine the respective rights of
the parties. The Secretary of Labor having acted the reason
of the Asisstant Secretary of Labor is disposed of. There is
nothing at issue, and I think the Commission to take the said
deposition should be recalled. Courts are not organized to do 
idle things, but to determine issues presented decreeing to
the respective parties the rights as law or equity may direct.
The entire record now being before the court, the court should
consider the record now and determine the respective rights of
the parties. The Secretary of Lbaor having persnally reviewed
the decision of the COmmissioner of Immigration, it is unnecessary
to examine into the right of the "Acting Secretary" in the
premises. The only other matter that remains for determination
is the contention that applicant was denied the right of having
his counsel appear before the Secretary of Lbaor for the purpose
of presenting such further evidence and oral argument as he
desired in support of his appeal, and whether such denial was
depriving the petitioner of a fair hearing or of due process of
<fw>--3--</fw>
<pb/>
law. No provision of law according to an alien the right of 
counsel before the Secretary of Labor has been called to my 
attention; nor do I Know of any such provision. Circuit Judge
Lacombe, of the Second Circuit, in U.S. v. Williams, 190 Fed.
898, says:</p>
<p>"There is nothing in the statute which calls for 
the presence of counsel at the examination of aliens
preliminary to admission; nothing to indicate that
it was the intent of Congress that these investigations
in hundreds of thousands of cases touching the qualifications
of an alien seeking to enter were to be conducted
as trials in court, with counsel present to
represent the alien, witnesses called to testify, and
elaborate examination and cross-examinations of them."</p>
<p>There is nothing in the rules of the Department in the determination
of appeals before the Secretary of Labor which would
justify a conclusion that counsel could appear before the Secretary 
and argue in support of his petiton or offer further
testimony, as a matter of right. The great volume of business
pending in the Department of Lbaor would make such as practice
impossible. Appeals are determined upon the brieds presented,
and no opportunity is afforded for argument, unless by special
courtesy. From the record in this case, there is nothing to
indicate that the petitioner did not have a fair hearing, and
that every issue presented was determined by the proper official
authorized by law. The Commission to take deposition is recalled.</p>
<p>The writ is discharged and the petitioner remanded to the
custody of the Department of Immigration.</p>
