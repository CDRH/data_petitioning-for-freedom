<body>  

<p>Territory of Washington,)
Third Judicial District.) ss.</p>

<p>In the District Court holding terms at Seattle.</p>

<p>In the matter of the application of I.E. Spafford for a writ
of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>To the Hon. Richard A. Jones of the above entitled
District Court:</p>

<p>The petition of I.E. Spafford respectfully shows to wit
your Honor,</p>

<p>1. That he is now imprisoned and restrained of his liberty
by William Cochrane, Sheriff of King County, in the jail
of said County, at the City of Seattle.</p>

<p>2. That your petitioner is not committed or detained upon
process issued on any final judgement of a Court of competent
jurisdiction nor for any contempt of any Court, officer or
body having authority in the premises to commit; nor upon a
warrant issued from the District Court upon an indictment or
information.</p>

<p>3. That the cause or pretense of the restraint according
to the best of the petitioner's knowledge and belief, is by
virtue of a certain Writ of committment issued by one R.C.
Portway, a Justice of the Peace in and for said King County,
on the 29th day of March, 1887, reciting and commanding as
follows:
"Whereas, at a Justice's Court this day held at my office,
in said County, for the examination of I.E. Spafford for the
alleged offense of having on said Mch. 22, 1887, in said
County, feloniously administered a certain dangerous and
deleterious drug to one Fanse Spafford, then and there being
pregnant with a quick child, with the intent and for the
purpose of causing an abortion and destroy such child, the said
administration not having been necessary to save the life of
said mother, whereby and for the reason of said administration
the siad Fanse Spafford did die, and upon arraingement
of said defendant for said alleged offense, the said defedant
did walve examination, and being by me adjudged to give
bail in the sum of $500 for his appearance at the next term
of the District Court to be held at Seattle, is said County
on the last Monday in May, 1887, and the defendant having
refused and failed to furnish said bonds, it was adjudged and
ordered that he be committed to the jail of said County until
he be discharged by law. Therefore, you the said Constable
and keeper of the jail are commanded him the said I.E.
Spafford to take into custody and safely keep until he furnish
said bonds, or until he shall thence be discharged by
due course of law."</p>

<p>4. That said imprisonment and restraint of your petitioner
is illegal; and such illegality consists in this: That
your petitioner is not guilty of the offense charged against
him in said writ, or any offense, and there is no probable</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>cause to believe him to be guilty of said offense, or guilty
of any criminal act wharever.</p>

<p>That the petitioner waived an examination as alleged in
said writ, but did so only because he was then without an
attorney to assist him, and had no competent legal adviser,
and was ignorant of his rights and the effect and consequences
of waiving an examination; and was induced to waive an
examination at that time by persons who represented that if
the examination should then be waived your petitioner could
afterwards have a fairer examination at Seattle.</p>

<p>Wherefore, your petitioner prays that a Writ of Habeas Corpus
to inquire into the cause of said imprisonment, and for his
discharge from the custody of said Sheriff.</p>

<p>Seattle, W.T., April 11th, 1887.</p>

<p>I.E. Spafford</p>

<p>Greene, Hanford + McGraw
Attorneys for Petitioner.</p>
