    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On January 4th, 1886, G. W. Caufield committed Charles Barnes to the jail of King County, Washington Territory for 35 days or until Barnes paid a total of $104.55 in fines for his involvement in the breaking and entering of the house of Charles Forger and the shooting of Eugene Cote by John Barnes on January 3, 1886 in a dispute over a child. On January 6, 1886, Barnes and his lawyers filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to Judge Roger S. Greene in King County claiming that Barnes had not received due process under the law and was being held without a trial or the court filing any charges against him. Greene granted the petition and the writ of Habeas Corpus was filed, however, the case files following the writ are missing. A newspaper article covering the case on January 7, 1886, states that Barnes was released from custody on the evening of the 6th and would be required to come before a jury regarding his January 4th charges. The fate of Charles following his release is unknown. </li>
