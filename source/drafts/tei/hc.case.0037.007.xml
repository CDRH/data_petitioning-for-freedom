<p>State of Missouri County of St Louis } ss. Before me the undersigned 
a Justice of the Peace within and for the County --
aforesaid personally comes George Henley --
who being duly sworn on his oath deposeth 
&amp; saith as follows to wit: I know the man (colored) 
John Black alias Crawley the last time I saw his absent 
from the State of Missouri was at Mobile 
State of Alabama; I knew him then as the 
slave property of one Stephen Gardier--
of the twelve mile point or Ashwood Landing 
State of Illinois, and is at present at large in said County without knowledge or consent of owner. I know that he is a runaway 
slave, and believe him still to be the property 
of said Stephen Gardier. Said slave is the man 
now produced before said Justice.</p>
