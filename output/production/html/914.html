    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On January 22, 1924, Herlinda Diaz was taken into custody and charged with being a "vagrant and prostitute" in Douglas County. A hearing took place on January 23 and witnesses examined by the state and the evidence the presented showed that Diaz was neither a vagrant or a prostitute. However, a testimony given at the hearing stated that Diaz was meeting Jose Carillo at various times and places against the wishes of her husband and mother. Diaz's lawyers argued that Diaz is a married woman with a home, and therefore not a vagrant, and that the said testimony does not establish her guilt of prostitution. Diaz subsequently filed a petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus against Douglas County sheriff Michael Endres. On January 27, 1925 the case was dismissed. The fate of Herlinda Diaz is unknown. </li>
