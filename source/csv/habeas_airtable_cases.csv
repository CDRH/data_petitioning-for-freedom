He was then arrested again in Multnomah County, convicted of larceny, and returned to the state penitentiary. Houghton appealed this decision to the state supreme court and then filed a writ of habeas corpus in the Marion County Circuit Court, which was granted. Houghton argued that his detention was illegitimate since his conviction was under appeal.

Lyon and H. E. Wood. The respondents were the half-sibling and in-law, respectively, of Annie Carpenter Clarke, the deceased ex-wife of the petitioner and mother of the bound party who had moved to Lancaster County with the children following the divorce in 1901. Judge Holmes granted the petition. The respondents claimed that they were appointed guardians of the bound party and given control of Annie's estate by her request after her death in 1906. They also alleged that the petitioner did not ever financially support his children after the divorce. Additionally, they claimed that he had a violent temper and was addicted to ""intoxicating liquors,"" thus not making him a suitable guardian for his children. After hearing evidence, Judge Holmes denied the writ and ordered that the children remain in custody of Lyon and Wood, but that the petitioner be able to visit them at seasonable times. In the Court's decision, they also mention that the petitioner was currently going through another divorce from his second wife. Clarke then moved for the Court to grant him a new trial, which was overruled. The appearance docket shows that the NE Supreme Court affirmed the Court's decision in 1909.

Malin after it was discovered that he had secretly aided mothers of the Sac and Fox Tribe in taking their children from the American Indian Boarding School at Toledo back to the tribe's reservation. There was a previous trial in this same case which determined that Peters had been wrongfully imprisoned. The judge ruled that Malin's court appointed guardianship of the children whom Peters had taken from the school was not legal, and therefore void. The judge also ruled that the state did not have the right to interfere in the proceedings of the school, because it was a federal institution and its attendees federal wards. Furthermore, the criminal laws of the state did not apply to the Native Americans and their tribes, and would only apply if a member of the tribe was involved in an act which ""brought him within the plane of the legislative jurisdiction of the state."" It was argued that this would apply only in a small number of cases. The ruling of this retrial is unknown.

Han Lee believed that Ah Chow intended to cross the border into Victoria and sell Seo Kim. It was also known that a man named Ah Ying had obtained a marriage license to marry Seo Kim, which Han Lee believed Seo Kim desired. Han Lee previously bought Seo Kim in China and believed that he was losing his property. 
Ah Chow denied that he was detaining Seo Kim. When ordered by the court to bring her in, he claimed that he had never held her captive nor had he any intent on selling her across the border. Even after a court order was issued, he refused to appear before Judge Orange Jacobs. The sheriff, H.G. Thornton was ordered to arrest and bring Seo Kim into custody. He brought her in but was not able to bring Ah Chow in at that time. A warrant was then issued for Ah Chow’s arrest, but Thornton could not find him, claiming he must have been hiding out somewhere in Seattle. Seo Kim was discharged from custody and the petition was dismissed.",,L.B. Andrews (clerk); H.G.

Additionally, he claimed that he was told that if he pled guilty, he would only receive one year in prison. Judge Hall allowed the petition. After hearing evidence, Hall granted a Seiffer a ""writ of relief"" from the custody of Leidigh and ordered that Seiffer be transferred into the custody of Furnas County sheriff to await additional legal action.

Greene, superintendent of the Nebraska Home for the Insane. Judge Holmes presumably granted the petition because the AD claims that Greene received a copy. However, a simultaneous action was occurring regarding the legal status of the bound party. When Milton was declared insane, his attorney Charles Whedon was appointed guardian of his affairs. On July 9th, Milton's nephews Joseph LaMaster and Hugh Cooper petitioned for Joseph Weber (nephew of Milton) and Hugh LaMaster (brother of Milton) to be appointed guardians instead. They claimed that Whedon did not have Milton's best interests at heart because he was not a relative and allegedly had a strained relationship with him. They also claimed that because Whedon was helping Milton petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which implied that he believed Milton to not be insane, therefore not in need of a guardian. On July 15th, Milton moved to dismiss the cause, which Judge Cornish granted. That same day, Cornish granted guardianship to Whedon and Hugh LaMaster.

Decker, for a writ of habeas corpus\""](hc.case.ne.0598)""]","[""Appearance Docket"", ""Court Journal""]","[""History Nebraska (Lincoln, NE)""]","John F. Decker petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that he was unlawfully detained by Sheriff Nicholas Ress. Judge Holmes granted the petition and allowed him bail at the sum of 300 dollars. Decker had been arrested on the charge of perjury after he falsely claimed during a divorce trial that he was a resident of Lancaster County, NE. After hearing evidence, Judge Holmes ruled that Decker had not committed perjury and therefore was being illegally detained. He ordered that Decker be released from custody. However, he ordered that the County Attorney, James L. Caldwell, prosecute Decker for the charge of contempt of court and punish him accordingly. Caldwell immediately followed through in State of Nebraska vs John F. Decker where again Decker was released on bail. The outcome of this case is unknown. Weeks later, Caldwell produced a motion for a re-hearing and a new trial for Decker's habeas corpus case, which the court overruled. In 1906, Caldwell's appeal was tried in the Nebraska Supreme Court, who later dismissed his petition in error.",,"Wilkinson. A.

Custody of their two young daughters, Naomi and Leona Gielday, was awarded to Flora. According to Flora, she moved to Iowa and re-married, while Joseph moved to Red Willow County, Nebraska, and took ill. Flora allowed Naomi and Leona to visit Joseph in order to help take care of him. At some point, Leona returned to her mother while Naomi remained with her father. When Joseph died in February 1898, a pair of brothers named Charles and George Shafer contrived to have custody of Naomi awarded to Charles, arguing that she had no relatives living in the state. Flora petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve Naomi, which was granted. Flora argued that she was Naomi's rightful guardian and that Charles ""only desires the custody of said minor child to gratify his own licentious designs and to accommodate the lust of his single brother George."" Charles countered that Flora was an abusive mother, that Naomi remained with the Shafers of her own volition, and that the District Court of Lancaster County, Nebraska had no jurisdiction over Red Willow County. After hearing the evidence, fourteen-year-old Naomi Gielday was remanded to the custody of Charles Shafer.",,"Bishop, George S.; Norris, George W.",,"[""Children"", ""domestic violence"", ""Minor Marriage""]",,,

A few years earlier, Samuel had placed the boys in the Home for the Friendless in Lincoln, Nebraska, from which institution the Helmses obtained custody of the two. The Helmses did not formally adopt Harry and Herbert, whom they put to work in their traveling minstrel show. After hearing the evidence, Harry and Herbert were released back into the custody of the Home for the Friendless. The judge ordered that Samuel could retrieve his children once he demonstrated that he could properly care for them and after he paid off his debt to the state.
