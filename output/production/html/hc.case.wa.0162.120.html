I was in the Bar room in the

Then I ran <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">diagonill[?]</span> across
the street and was within 20
feet when I saw the light in
the star building  I spoke to
some one in the California house
as I ran out    when I saw
the light in the star building and
not see any one coming seems
to me I did see some one on
the street but do not know who it
was   saw no one ahead of me

was entirely ajar when I saw the
light in the star building the door
of the <span class="tei_add">building</span> 
         <del>man</del> was entirely ajar the Mans
Body would prevent it from closing

saw the same person was leaning
over him as when I arrived at

<span class="hr"> </span>


at the door    It was the defendant
something less than a minute elapsed
after I heard the shot until I got there
The deft was asking some one to
bring watter or why they did not bring
water   She seemed in the act of
trying to give relief to the man
she was excited and was <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">wringing[?]</span>
her hands and asked me if he was
hurt and said she had shot at him
but did not think she had hurt him
</p>

      <p class="tei_p">
She adressed me first and asked
him afterwards a couple of minutes
afterwards when I told her she had
shot him she told me she did not
intend to shoot him she was trying
get some one to give him some whiskey
so as to revive him  Shortly after
I got there I think one of the Girls
from the House brought some water the
first thing after I got there I asked
her what was the trouble and she
replied that she shot at him or the
man <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">I can not share whether she said[?]</span>
him or the man – His head laying the
outer N. E. corner, on his back with his
face up his head pressed forward <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">by[?]</span>

shot the man O. My God have I
shot him  She showed considerable
feeling

took it from somewhere in her dress
</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I was on the left side of the body
when I got up to get the Revolver – she
could see me in a the body of the

minutes   She told me this a few
minutes after, she told me she asked
him to get out he replied he would
not go out, Did not at that or
any other time <span class="tei_add">before the coroner inquest</span> tell me that he said
