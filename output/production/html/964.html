    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Lee Kee was arrested on the conviction of keeping a resort for using opium, and sentenced to hard labor for 30 days, as well as a fine of $50. Wo Lin (presumably switched from Harold Preston) attorney on behalf of Kee, petitioned that he was illegally imprisoned on the basis of being charged in an alleged commitment which doesn't constitute crime, improper jurisdiction, lack of authority, and no due process of law. Lee Kee was later discharged from custody.</li>
