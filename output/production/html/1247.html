    <li>Summary of Proceedings: William Reitman was arrested with a warrent issued by the secretary of labor issued on January 16th, 1918. He was questioned by an immigration inspector about his involvement with the I.W.W. William explained that he had been a member of the group for many years, but did not agree with all their beliefs or teach the destruction of property. Despite this, he was detained in an immigration detention station by Henry M. White. William Reitman petitioned for habeas corpus on November 29th, 1918 claiming he was being illegally detained without cause. The judge approved his petition however the outcome of the writ is unknown. </li>
