<p>The defendants also read in evidence to the jury a letter of the words and figures as follows.</p>

<p>Office Dept Indian Affairs<lb/>
Atchison Kansas Oct 23d 1868</p>

<p>Sir. I transmit herewith for your information and government a copy of letter of the 16th inst from Hon Charles E. Mix act commission. You will do all in your power to have the instructions of the act Commission carried out. And should any

<pb/>

delegation from your tribes contemplate visiting Washington without special instructions from the Dept. you will promptly advise this office.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully<lb/>
Your obedient<lb/>
Thomas Murphy<lb/>
Super Indian Affairs<lb/>
per A.C. Farnham Clk</p>


<p>A Wiley Esq<lb/>
U.S. Indians Agent<lb/>
Sac &amp; Fox Agency<lb/>
Kansas</p>



<p>The defendant then read to the jury the agreed statement made <unclear>between</unclear> the attorneys for the plaintiff and the attorney for said defendant. Being same as read by plaintiff in evidence is this trial copied in his evidence.</p>

<p>The defendant then introduced as a witness Thomas Dorwin who being sworn testified as follows. I was acting as deputy united states Marshall at the time of the arrest of the Indian Keokuk and others and was present at the examination <unclear>before</unclear> Montgomery United States Commissioner. I objected to the Indians going out with Captain Christian unless I went with them

<pb/>

because they were then under arrest. Wiley did not say they should not go out. Captain Christian advised them not to give bail Wiley then said "then they will have to go to jail," Wiley may have been a little excited but he was no more excited than Captain Christian. Wiley did not say to me "then Mr. Marshall I insist upon their going to jail" I stood within five feet of them and heard all that was said. I took them to jail by order of commission Montgomery. The mittimus shown me signed by W.P. Montgomery was my authority for putting plaintiff in jail and I did so by the authority of said mittimus and not by the direction of Wiley. I took the plaintiff to jail about 5 or 6 o'clock PM of the 23d of November AD 1868 and took him from the jail about 9 or 10 O'clock AM on the 24th of November 1868. I did not put my hand on plaintiff nor did any person in my presence. I used him as kindly as I knew now and I saw nothing

<pb/>

to the contrary on the part of any person in their conduct towards him. I offered then every chance to get jail out they would not do it.</p>
<p>The defendant then read to the jury as evidence in the case the mittimus which is in the words and figures as follows.</p>
