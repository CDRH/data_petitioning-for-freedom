<p> To the Hon John W Colvin Law Commissioner Court 
of Saint Louis County ~ </p>

<p> The petition of <del> William Blackburn </del> Sarah Broadwater 
showeth, that William blackburn <del> he </del> is now a prisoned restrained of his 
liberty in the custody of the County Jailor of the 
County of Saint Louis in the State of Missouri, upon 
the charge or accusation of being a run away slave 
or fugitive from service and that such impr-
isonment and restraint is within the common Jail 
of the said County of Saint Louis and the name of 
the said Jailor is James A Felks as your petitioner 
is informed and verily believes. </p>

<p> Your petitioner further showeth that said Blackburn <del> he </del> is not 
imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, upon any 
charge, for any reason, or upon any account which 
prevents him from applying for and obtaining the 
benefit of the writ of Habeas Corpus, as she is in-
formed &amp; verily believes, in or for any cause or reason 
specified in the sixth section of the said article 
of chapter seventy five of the statutes of the State 
of Missouri of 1845, Entitled an act regulating 
proceedings on writs of Habeas Corpus. </p>

<p> Your petitioner further showeth that the 
annexed paper marked A, is a true copy 
of the Process  by which <del> he </del> said Blackburn is claimed to be 
held in such restraint &amp; confinement as she is 
informed &amp; verily believes. </p>

<p> Your petitioner further showeth, that said Blackburn <del> he </del> was 
merely arrested &amp; imprisoned upon suspicion of being 
a run away slave, and that no person can or 
does, to his knowledge or belief claim service from 
him, or claim him as a slave, and that he is 
not a Slave, but is a free man and entitled 
as such to his freedom as she verily believes and that such res-
traint &amp; imprisonment is illegal, and that such 

illegality consists in imprisoning him as a run 
away Slave, where in such &amp; in fact he is not 
a Slave or a run away Slave but is a free man 
and she makes this Petition for and on the behalf of said William Blackburn who is a son in law of petitioner </p>

<p> Therefore your petitioner prays <del> to </del> that said William Blackburn be discharged 
from such imprisonment, on your honor being satisfied of the 
fact that he is not a run away Slave &amp; is en-
titled to his freedom, and for the purpose of 
determining that question that a writ of Habeas 
Corpus may issue to bring him before your Honor 
and she prays for such Habeas Corpus accordingly. </p>
