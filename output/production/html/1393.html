    <li>Summary of Proceedings: James Hallahan filed this petition stating that he was being unlawfully deprived of his liberty by John Briggs, the Chief of Police for South Omaha, and Michael Corcoran, one of the jailors. He was taken into custody on 16 May 1913. The petition stated that no complaint or indictment was filed against him in the state of Colorado. Despite this, he was taken into custody. Section 330, Page 2481 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska required that a complaint, charge, or affidavit must be filed against someone in order for them to be taken into custody. Moreover, the petition stated that Hallahan was only 17 and, thus, was a minor. So, even if he had been charged with a crime he would have been treated as a delinquent, not as a criminal in the city jail. On 19 May 1913, Judge A. C. Troup allowed the writ. The Appearance Docket stated that Hallahan&#x2019;s release was ordered on 21 May 1913.</li>
