<p>Territory of Washington 
County of Walla Walla 
Samuel H Montgomery 
vs 
Edwina Montgomery def</p>

<p>To the Honorable Samuel C Winegard
Judge of the District Court first 
judicial district of Washington Ter
ritory </p>

<p>The above named plaintiff com
plaining of said defendant states 
the following facts</p>

<p>1st That plaintiff is a resident of 
Columbia County in said Territory 
and has resided there for eight 
years last <unclear>past</unclear></p>

<p>2nd That on the 23rd day of January 
1870, plaintiff and defendant 
intermarried</p>

<p>3rd That plaintiff and defendant 
have two children the issue of said 
marriage to wit; George Clarence 
Montgomery six years old last 
January and Myra Bell Montgom
ery aged four years last April</p>
 
<p>4th That about the 1st of October 1876,
plaintiff and defendant separated, 
the defendant leaving plaintiff, and

living separately and apart from him</p> 

<p>5th That on Sunday the 27th day of May 1877 
defendant was about going to Dayton
under the pretense of finding employment,
which, if she failed to find, she rep-
resented that she <unclear>would</unclear> go to Walla 
Walla or elsewhere</p>

<p>6th That plaintiff allowed said chil-
dren to go with defendant to Dayton
under a promise on the part of a 
brother of plaintiff to return the
children to the house of plaintiff on
the evening of said day; that def-
endant having arrived at Dayton
refused to allow said children 
to be returned to plaintiff, but de-
tained them in her custody.</p>

<p>7th That on the 29th of May 1877, 
plaintiff applied to defendant 
at the hotel in Dayton where def-
endant was stopping, and requested 
the defendant to return to his home 
and live with plaintiff as his wife, 
and that they would take the chil
dren with them and properly care 
for and raise them up and <unclear>urged</unclear> 
that defendant should do
so, and that defendant utterly 

refused so to do, and that plain
tiff there upon demanded the poss
ession and custody of said chil
dren, as their father and natural
gaurdian but that defendant abso
lutely refused to deliver --------
----- to plaintiff the said Myra Bell 
Montgomery or to allow plaintiff to take 
her, threatening that before he should 
do so, she would kill plaintiff, 
and plaintiff believes she was ready to 
put the said threat into execution 
if he had attempted to take said 
child.</p>

<p>8th That said Myra Bell Montgomery, 
is unlawfully restrained of her liberty 
and Deft <unclear></unclear> the custody of plaintiff
by said Edward Montgomery the 
above named defendant at <unclear></unclear> 
hotel in Dayton in said County
Columbia; that the cause and pre
tense of said restraint according to 
the best knowledge and belief of 
plaintiff are that defendant claims 
the custody of said child on account
of being its mother</p>

<p>9th That plaintiff alleges said restraint 
to be illegal in this that plaintiff is the

Father and natural guardian of said 
child and in a better condition to prop
erly raise educated and provide for 
her than said defendant </p>

<p>10th Wherefore plaintiff prays that 
a writ of Habeas Corpus issue to the 
end that said child Myra Bell 
Montgomery may be brought before 
your honor and discharged from 
said restraint, and delivered into the 
custody of plaintiff, and the said 
defendant be required to appear 
at the same time and place and 
show why she has held said child 
in restraint as aforesaid.</p>

<p>Witness <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> Samuel F Thompson </p>
