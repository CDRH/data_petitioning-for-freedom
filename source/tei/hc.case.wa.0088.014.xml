<p>And your respondents further allege and state that said Alice McKay is a wholly unfit person to be permitted to have the care or control or custody of said child, having abandoned the same to the care of strangers voluntarily when a mere infant, and never having cared for her since. That said Alice McKay has no means whatever and is wholly unable to properly care for, maintain or educate said child.</p>

<p>And your respondents further aver that the father of said child, and its mother, the said Alice McKay, are both of a grossly immoral and intemparate character; that
<pb/>
that the father of said child is now a fugitive from justice and absent from Washington Territory; that the said Alice McKay is now living separate from her said husband and is cohabiting and living in adultery with a man, whose name is unknown to affiant; that said Alice McKay is greatly addicted to the use of liquor and is frequently grossly intoxicated; that the said Alice McKay is now the proprietor of a low saloon in the City of Tacoma, Washington Territory, to which saloon, as respondents are informed and believe she proposes to take said child <del/> should this Honorable Court award her the custody of the same; that said Alice McKay is a person of very bad moral character having been convicted of the crime of selling liquor to Indians at the November term of the District Court, holding terms at Tacoma W.T. on or about the 1st day of January 1884, and is a person wholly unfit to have the care of an infant child; that if said Alice McKay be given the custody of said child, these <del/> respondents verily believe that said child will be reared up to lead an immoral life: that said child is desirous of remaining with these respondents, and if left in their custody will be reared in a good home and to a good life.</p>

<p>By reason of the aforesaid facts, your petitioners allege that they are legally entitled to the custody of said child, nevertheless they here produce the body of said Mary McKay, and request that she be again remanded to their custody.</p>
