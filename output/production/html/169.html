    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In April of 1885, Wilson D. Coyle assaulted Charles Seaman and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and ordered to pay a $200 fine for his crimes in May of 1885. After serving 60 days in jail, Coyle was still being held in jail, as he had not yet paid his fines. Coyle then filed a writ of habeas corpus on July 3, 1885, claiming that he was being unlawfully imprisoned for longer than his term. On the same day, Judge George Turner allowed the writ and ordered Coyle and Sheriff E. J. Whittier to appear in front of him in court. The outcome of the writ and the fate of the bound party is unknown. </li>
