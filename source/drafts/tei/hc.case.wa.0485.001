<pb/><p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON NORTHERN DIVISION</p>
<p> IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION OF CHIN DOE TUNG FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.} No. 3378. Filed Juny 27,1916. </p> 
<p>Hugh C. Todd, For Petitioner. Clay Allen, U.S. Attorney. Albert Moodie, Asst. U.S. Attorney, For Government.<p>
<p> Netherer, District Judge: I think the petition must be dismissed and the writ discharged
This court, in Ex Parte Moola Signh et al, 207 Fed.
780, at page 782, said:</p>
<p>"The authority of the Immigration officers and the 
jurisdiction of the courts depend upon power conferred
by Congress. It is a matter of legislation. No discretion
is vested in the courts. Congress has the right
to legislate upon the subject, prescribe rules, fix 
limits, and confer authority where it deems wise in legislating
upon the subject at hand. The supreme authority 
is conferred upon the Immigration officers. The jurisdiction
of the court is limited to ascertaining whether
the petitioners were denied a hearing." </p>
<p>An examination of the record does not disclose the denial
of any right of the petitioner. Ther contention that the conclusion 
of the Immigration officers is not warranted by the
testimont presented is not for the court of determine: nor
can the court say that the contention of the petitioner that
the Secretary of Labor determined the appeal upon a ground
other than the charge upon which petitioner was ordered deported
is well founded, as testimony was taken upon the
paternity and minority of the applicant, also as to whether or not 
the alleged father is a domiciled merchant, and also upon the
marriage of the petitioner and the relation he bore to the household
of the alleged father. The court's inquiry is limited as
to whether the applicant was accorded an impartial hearing, and
cannot inquire into the sufficiency of probative facts or consider
reasons for the conclusions reached by the Immigration
<pb/>
officers. The question is not, would the court have come to 
the same conclusion, but, was the petitioner accorded a fair
hearing, Chin You v. U.S., 208 U.S. 8. The court cannot
say that he was not.<p/>
<ab>Jeremiah Neterer JUDGE.<ab/>
