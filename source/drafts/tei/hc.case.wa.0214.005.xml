<p>That he arrived from his visit in Japan in the United States on or about the first day of July 1920 and after a hearing and examination before the United States Commissionerof Immigration at the Port of Seattle and a Board of Special Enquiry convened for that purpose, your petitioners herein were excluded from the United States for the reason that Kichitaro Kubota never had a legal residence in the United States and that no passport should have been issued for his return to the United States, also</p>

<pb/>

<p>that they are parties liable to become a public charge.</p>

<p>That an appeal was taken from such decision to the Secretary of Labor, who on or about the 18th day of August 1920 dismissed, refused and denied said appeal.</p>

<p>That your petitioners were denied a just and fair hearing but were arbitratily excluded and denied admission, because of prejudice and in utter disregard of the testimony and that petitioners now have in their possession other and additional proof showing their residente in the United States in addition to the submitted before the board of special enquiry, and that the board of special enquiry which heard the case of your petitioners was not legally constituted.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE your petitioners pray that a writ of Habeas Corpus may issue herein to the said Henry M.
