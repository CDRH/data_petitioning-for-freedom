    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In June 1919, Jennie Greenwald petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of her husband, Harry Greenwald. The petition alleged Harry was imprisoned and detained by F.D. Simons, who was about to extradite Harry to the state of California without any just legal process or authority of law. Simons received a telegraph, the contents unknown to the petitioner, that informed Harry would be immediately removed to California, and charged with an offense which was not disclosed to the petitioner. The writ was not served at the request of Harry's attorney, and in a later order from the judge, it was revealed the petitioner was discharged in said cause and ordered the petition to be dismissed. </li>
