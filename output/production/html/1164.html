    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On May 9, 1888, one M. Cross filed a complaint against S.M. McFarland with justice of the peace W.H. Kuhn for leaving the county with property that he had filed a chattel mortgage on that Cross had financed on May 15, 1886. Such property included two 7-year-old mules, a harness, and a wagon. Kuhn ordered county sheriff N.R. Marquiss to put McFarland in the county jail, as he did not pay a $300 bail. This was apparently the second time that McFarland had been arrested for breaking his agreement with Cross. On the same day, McFarland filed for a writ of habeus corpus, arguing that violating his mortgage wasn't a crime. At a hearing on May 10, 1888, judge William G. Langford agreed and ordered McFarland to be released.</li>
