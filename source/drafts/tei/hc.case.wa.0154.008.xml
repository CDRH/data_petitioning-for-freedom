Petitioner,
vs
Herbert O. Wiliams, and
Grace E. Williams,
Respondents</p>

<p>Exhibit A
No. 41727
PETITION FOR WRIT OF
HABEAS CORPUS</p>

<p>To the Honorable George E. Morris, one of the judges of the
Superior Court of the State of Washington, in and for the County of
King.</p>

<p>The Petition of Peter A. Clifford respectfully shows:-</p>

<p>I.</p>

<p>That at all of the times herein stated he was and now is 
a citizen and resident of the State of California, and that
defendants are and for more than three months last past have been
citizens and residents of the State of Washington, in the County
of King.</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>That on the 17th, day of October, A.D.1899, one Grace E. Long
was a citizen and resident of the State of California and on that
day your petitioner and the said Grace E. Long, at the City and
County of San Francisco, in the said State of California, intermar-
ried and became husband and wife, and the said Grace E. Long thereby
became Grace E. Clifford.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>That thereafter your petitioner and his said wife lived
together as such husband and wife in the City and County of San 
Francisco, State of California until about the 7th day of March A. D.
1901, and that on or about the said last named day the said Grace E.
Clifford deserted and abandoned your petitioner without any just cause
and without his consent.</p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p> That during the marriage of your petitioner and the said
Grace E. Clifford, there was born to them, as the issue of said marriage,
a female child, now living, and of the age of three years and six months, named Alice
B. Clifford.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p>That on the 24th. day of March, A.D.1902, the said Grace E. 
Clifford commenced an action in the Superior Court in and for the
City and County of San Francisco, State of California, for an absolute
divorce from your petitioner, and therein prayed for the custody of
said child of said marriage, and your petitioner appeared in said
action and filed his answer, and also a cross-complaint for a divorce
from the said Grace E. Clifford therein, and in said cross-complaint orayed
that the custody of said child should be awarded to him by said Court.</p>

<p>VI.</p>

<p>That thereafter such proceedings were had in such action and
cross-action that the judgment of said Court was given, made and
entered therein, denying a divorce to said Grace E. Clifford and
granting a divorce to your petitioner, and awarding the custody of
said child to Grace E. Clifford until further order of the 
Court; and providing that your petitioner should be allowed to see
said child once a week and to take the same out with him once in every
two weeks.</p>

<p>VII.</p>

<p>That at the time of the commencement of said action and from
thence on down and including the time of the entry of said judgment,
your petitioner, the said Grace E. Clifford and said child were all
citizens and bona fide residents of said City and County of San Fran-
cisco, in said State of California, and actually present therein,
and your petitioner and the said Grace E. Clifford had been such
citizens and residents of said City and County continuously since the
date of their said marriage, and said child had been such citizen
and resident continuously since the date of her birth, and within
the jurisdiction of said Superior Court was then and yet is a Court of record
and of superior jurisdiciton.</p>

<p>VIII.</p>

<p>That aftet the date of entry of said judgment by said
Superior Court, the said Grace E. Clifford continued to reside in
said City and County of San Fransisco until sometime in September,
A.D.1903, the exact time being unknown to your petitioner, and that
during said month she secretly and surreptitiously and without the
permission of said Superior Court, and in contempt thereof, and with-
out the knowledge or consent of your petitioner, took said child
out of the State of California.</p>

<p>IX.</p>

<p>That on the 27th day of November, A.D. 1903, you petitioner
filed in the Superior Court a verified petition on said action
and cross-action for a modification of the judgment therein by taking
away from the custody of said Grace E. Clifford the said child and
awarding the custody thereof to your petitioner, and such proceedings
were thereupon made had that an order was made and entered therein
modifying and changing said judgment and taking the custody of said
child from said Grace E. Clifford and awarding the same to your
petitioner until the further order of the said Superior Court, and
said order ever since has been and still is standing and not set aside
and in full force and effect, and under the laws of the State of
California, at the time of the commencement of said action and at
the time of the entry of said judgment, and at the time of the making
of said order, said child was a ward of said Court and under the
control thereof; and it is provided by the laws of the said State
that said Court could be at any time after the entry of said judg-
ment make any order with or without notice modifying said judgment
as to make the custody of said child.</p>

<p>X.</p>

<p>That since the judgment of divorce, the said Grace E.
Clifford and one Herbert O. Williams above named, intermarried in
said State of California, and became and ever since have been and
now are husband and wife, and ever since their said marriage have
had in the State of California and elsewhere and now have at the town
of Georgetown in said County of King, said child in their custody 
and possession.</p>

<p>XI.</p>

<p>That on the 19th, day of January, 1904 at the said town of
Georgetown, your petitioner presented to the said Herbert O.
O. Williams and the said Grace E. Williams a copy of the record and
proceedings of the said Superior Court of said City and County of
San Francisco, in said action and cross-action, certified under and
in pursuance of an act of the Congress of the United States, in such
case made and provided and demanded from them and each of them
immediate delivery of said child to him, said petitioner, but they
refused and still do refuse to give up said child, and said child
ever since has been and now is imprisoned and restrained of her
liberty by them at said town of Georgetown, and that according to
the best of your petitioner's knowledge and belief, the cause or pre-
tense of the aforesaid confinement or restraint of the said Alice
B. Clifford is that under the said judgment of said Superior Court
of said City and County of San Francisco, the custody of said child
was given to the said Grace E. Clifford now Grace E. Williams. until
futher order of that Court, and that after she, secretly and
surreptituously took said child beyond the limits of said State of
California, as aforesaid, said Superior Court lost all jurisdiction
to make any further order in said action or cross-action, in regard
to, in modification of said judgment, as to the custody of said child,
and that after said child was brought into the said State of Washing-
ton, said Herbert O. Williams, with the consent of said Grace E.
Williams, and without the knowledge or consent of said Superior Court
of said City and County of San Francisco, undertook, under the laws
of the said State of Washington, to adopt said child as his own. And
your petitioner further states that he is advised by counsel W. H.
White, Esq., resding at the City of Seattle, State of Washington, and
J. J. Burt, Esq.,
residing at the City and County of San Francisco, State of California,
that the said imprisonment of the said child, Alice B. Clifford, is 
illegal and that the illegality consists in this, towit:-</p>

<p>That said Superior Court of the said City and County of
San Francisco had jurisdiction to award the custody of said child,
upon the facts herein before alleged, until further order of the
Court, and to thereafter change or modify thhe judgment as to the 
custody of saaid child, with or without notice to any or either of
the parties to said action, and that under Article 4, Section I,
of the Constitution of the United States, full faith and credit must
be given in the State of Washingto to the acts and proceedings of
said Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, and all
persons and Courts must recognize the petitioner's right to the
custody of said child under said order, in said State of Washington,
as well as under the laws of the country existing between said State
of California and said State of Washington. And your petitioner
further states that there is danger that the said Herbert O. Williams
and the ssaid Grace E. Williams will take or send the said child out
of this State, from the fact that they secretly and without the per-
mission of the said Superior Court of the City and County of San
Francisco and in contempt thereof, took said child beyond the limits
of the State of California.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE, your Petitioner prays a writ of habeas corpus to
bring up the body of said child, Alice B. Clifford, to abide such
order as your Honor may direct, and that also a warrant issue immedi-
ately to take said child.</p>

<p>Ex. A Con</p>

<p>Upon the reading and filing of the foregoing Petition verified
by the Petitioner, whereby it appears that Alice B. Clifford is
illegally imprisoned and restrained of her liberty by Herbert O.
Williams and Grace E. Williams, at the town of Georgetown, in the
County of King, State of Washington, and stating wherein the illegality
consists, from which is appears to me that a writ of habeas corpus 
should issue :+</p>

<p>It is ordered that a writ of habeas corpus issue out of and
under the deal of the Superior Court of the State of Washington, in
and for the County of King, directed to the said Herbert O. William
and Grace E. Williams, commanding them and each of them to have the
body of Alice B. Clifford before me May 33, 1904 at 1:30 of such day
in the Court room of said Court to do and receive what shall then
and there be considered concerning the said Alice B. Clifford, to-
gether with the time and cause of her detention, and that they have
then and there the said writ.</p>

<p>It further appearing that there is good reason to believe that
said Alice B. Clifford, will be carried out of and beyond the juris-
diction of said Court, it ordered that a warrant issue out of and
under the seal of said Court to the Sheriff of King County, com-
manding him to take the said Alice B. Clifford and to hold her in
custody until the determination of said Petition.</p>

<p>Dated, January 20, 1904.</p>

 </p>

 <p>For a separate and affirmative defense to petitioner's petition,
 respondents allege:</p>

 <p>I.</p>

 <p>That respondent, Grace E. Williams, then Grace. E. Long, and 
 petitioner, Peter A. Clifford, then residents of San Francisco, Cali-
 fornia, were married in San Francisco, California, on or about the 17th,
 day of October, 1899; that very soon after said marriage, petitioner
 came home in a state of hopeless intoxication; that at frequent inter-
 vals thereafter, petitioner came home drunk, at which times he was 
 abusive to respondent, and caused her great pain and distress, so that
 it became impossible to longer endure his conduct, whereupon on or
 about July, 1900, said respondent left petitioner, and returned
 to her mother's home. That on or about the 5th day of August, 1900,
 after repeated promises on the part of petitioner to resume the duties
 and obligations of a husband toward said respondent, said respondent
 returned to petitioner with a view to living with him again as his 
 wife. That very soon thereafter, petitioner became abusive, commenced
 drinking and neglecting said respondent, and failed to provide for her
 comfort, and respondent, who was then an expectant mother, ws sore
 distressed; that their child, Alice B. Clifford, was born on October
 14, 1900; that thereafter petitioner refused to provide for respondent's
 comfort, or to provide her with medical attendance and neglected her
 so that on or about the day of March, 1901, said respondent was
 compelled to and did leave said petitioner and returned again to
 hermother's home, where she was provided with medical attendance and
 other comforts necessary to herself and child, That during the time
 petitioner and said respondent lived together, petitioner wholly
 failed to provide her with clothing which during all of said time was
 furnished her by her mother. That in April, 1902, said respondent
 brought an action for divorce from petitioner which resulted in a
 decree of the Superior Court of San Francisco County, California,
 dissolving the bonds of matrimony theretofore existing between said
 respondent and petitioner and awarding the sole care of custody and
 control of their infant child, Alice B. Clifford, to said respondent,
 its mother, a copy of which said decree is hereto attached marked
 "Exhibit A" and is hereby referred to and made a part of this answer.</p>

 <p>That thereafterm in or about the 15th, day of August, 1903,
 said respondent and Herbert O. Williams were intermarried in San Fran-
cisco, California, and ever since have been and now are husband and
wife. That on or about the 24th, day of September, 1903, respondents
left the State of California and came to Seattle, King County, Washington,
to make iit possible for Herbert O. Williams to enter to employ of 
his brother, Charles L. Williams, who was then and is now a prominent
contractor and builder in the City of Seattle. That since coming to
Seattle, said Herbert O. Williams has been in his brother's employ as
a carpenter and has been earning and does now earn the sun of three
dollars ($3.00) per day.</p>

<p>That thereafter, said respondents became desirous of
adopting said Alice B. Clifford as their ow child, and thereupon on
or about the 12th day of November, 1903, respondents petitioned the
Superior Court of King County, Washington, in cause Number 5262,
entitled "In the matter of the adoption of Alice B. Clifford, and infant,
by Herbert O. Williams and Grace E. Williams, his wife, "for permission
to adopt said child, Alice B. Clifford, as their own. That thereafter,
such proceedings were had the a decree of adoption was entered bu
said Superior Court of King County, Washington, adjudging that from and
after said date, said infant, Alice B. Clifford should to all legal in-
tents and purposes be the child of the petitioners, respondents herein,
Herbert O. Williams and Grace E. Williams, the same as if she had
been born to them in lawful wedlock, and that the name of said child
be changed to Alice B. Williams, a copy of which decree is hereto at-
tached and marked "exhibit B", which is hereby referred to and made
a part of this answer by virtue of which, said respondents claim the
rightful posession of said infant, Alice B. Wiliams.</p>

<p>Respondents further allege that they are amply able to 
provide a suitable home for said child and to make reasonable provision
for its future usefulness and happiness in life.</p>

<p>That respondents left the State of California not for the
purpose of evading the order of nor in contempt of any Court nor did
they leave secretly nor surreptitiously, but they came to  the State of
Washington in good faith in view of better business opportunities as
aforesaid in Seattle and for the purpose of becoming bona fide citizens
of the State of Washington. That respondents now are and expect to
remain citizens of the State of Washington.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE, respondents pray that the writ of habeas corpus
issued herein may be dissolved, and that said child, Alice B. Williams,
be released from the custody of the Sheriff of King County, and returned
to the custody and keeping of respondents, Grace E. Williams and
Herbert O. Williams, and for their costs and disbursements n this
behalf expended.</p>
