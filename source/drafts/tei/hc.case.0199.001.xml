<p>No. 4476</p>

<p>In the Distritct Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington,</p>
<p>Northern Division.</p>

<p>Tx</p>

<p>Filed in the United States District Court</p>
<p>Western District of Washington</p>
<p>Northern Divison</p>

<p>Dec 16 1918</p>

<p>F.M. Harshberger, Clerk</p>
<p>By S.E. Lietch Deputy</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Rudolf Tschahler, for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>

<p>No. 4479 Complaint</p>

<p>The complainant, Rudolph Teschahle, appearing by Ralph S. Pierce, his attorney, complains to the court and alleges and petitions as follows:</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>That at all times hereinafter mentioned,complainant was and still is a subject of Russia, lawfully domiciled in the United States of America; that he is not restrained of his liberty on any charge or conviction of crime, nor on any process issued on any final judgement of a court of competent jurisdiction, nor on any warant, committment or other process issued on any indictment or information; nor on any order or warrant of committment, otherwise than as hereinafter specified.</p>

<p>2.</p>

<p>That on the 25th day of January, 1918, complainant was arrested by an Immigration Inspector of the United States, on a warrant of arrest issued by the Secretary of Labor of the United States wherein complainant is charged with being an alien; and with having been found within the United States, advocating or teaching the unlawful destruction of property, and with having been a person likely to become a public charge at the time of his entry into the United States; and on the 30th day of April, 1918, pursuant to the mandate of said warrant, complainant was taken before Thomas M Fisher,an Immigration Inspector of the United States of Yakima, Washington, and given a hearing for the purpose of inquiring into the merits of said charge. That he was questioned by said Thomas M. Fisher and in reply to questions answered: "I entered the United States in March, 1914, at New York. I am a Socialist, not a Red or Radical. I do not believe in the Bolsheviki. Since I entered the country I worked in a rug factory in the East, and as a common laborer since coming West. At the time of my arrest, I had $88.44 and had a savings account in Ladd and Tilton's bank in Portland, Oregon." That said questions and answers were reported by a stenographer employed by the United States Department of Labor, and subsequently transcribed and introduced in evidence against complainant in substantiation of the charges contained in the warrant of arrest hereinabove referred to, together with many other questions and answers having no bearing upon and in no manner material to said charges; and that said transcript constituted the only evidence ever introduced against complainant in substantiation of said charges. That at no time was complainant questioned as to whether he had ever advocated or taught the unlawful destruction of property, or anything else, or even whether he believed in such unlawful destruction, except as above indicated, nor was he questioned about his ability to work and support himself, or about the liklihood of his becoming a public charge at the time of his entry into the United States, or at any other time, except as above indicated; nor was any evidence of any character offered or received upon any of said questions except as above indicated.</p>

<p>3.</p>

<p>That Complainant is now, and ever since the 25th day of January, 1918, has been continuously restrained of his liberty in the County jail at Yakima, Yakima County, Washington, by Henry M. White, United States Commissioner of Labor, stationed at Seattle, under the pretended authority of the warrant of arrest issued by the Secretary of Labor, as hereinabove alleged, and not otherwise, and that said restraint is illegal for the following reasons, to-wit:</p>
<p>First: That although approximately ten months have elapsed since the warrant upon which complainant is held in custody, was originally issued, and complainant arrested thereunder, and more than seven months have elapsed since the hearing conducted in pursuance of the mandate in said warrant was fully concluded, and although complainant has at no time requested, consented to nor in any manner been responsible for any delay in conducting or concluding said hearing or in deciding the issues presented thereon; and although nearly ninety days have elapsed since the record of the proceedings on said hearing was finally transmitted to the Secretary of Labor of the United States, for his decision and order, still said Secretary has rendered no decision and made no order in said matter and by reason thereof and of the manner in which said hearing was conducted and complainant compelled to testify thereat, against himself, complainant has been restrained of his liberty, without due process of law and deprived of his rights under the provisions of the Fifth Article of the Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>Second: That on the hearing conducted to inquire into the charges upon which complainant is restrained of his liberty, above referred to, no evidence whatever was introduced, to sustain the charge that complainant had ever advocated or taught or been found advocating or teaching the unlawful destruction of property, or that he was at the time of his entry into the United States, or at any other time, likely to become a public charge, upon which the Secretary of Labor of the United States could make an order directing that complainant be deported from the United States, or any other order, in any manner restraining complainant of his liberty, and that any warrant or order which said Secretary of Labor might make other than an order discharging complainant from custody, would be arbitrary and wholly void. </p>
<p>Third: That complainant is informed and believes that there are only two copies of the testimony introduced on the hearing of the charges upon which he is restrained of his liberty, and that one of said copies is in the possession of the Secretary of Labor of the United States at Washington, D.C. and the other in the possession of Henry M. White, Commissioner of Labor of the United States, at Seattle, Washington. That complainant demanded a copy of said evidence, in order that he might attach the same to this petition, but his demand therefor was refused by said Henry M. White. That complainant is a common laborer and as a result of his long confinement and the deprivation of his usual means of support, he is unable, by reason of his poverty, to pay for the preparation of such a copy, but deponent is informed by his attorney, and believes that if the said Henry M. White is required to produce the transcript of said evidence, now in his possession, and make the same a part of his return herein, or exhibit the same to the court, the verity of complainant's allegations in relation thereto will clearly appear therefrom.</p>

<p>Wherefore, complainant prays an order directing the Clerk to issued out of and under the seal of this court, a writ directed to Henry M. White, Commissioner of Labor for the United States, stationed at Seattle, Washington, requiring him to produce the body of complainant in the above entitled court, before the Jeremiah Neterer a judge thereof, on the 23rd day of December, 1918, at two o'clock in the afternoon, and that he then and there show cause, if any he has, why the complainant should be further restrained of his liberty, and further directing that said Henry M. White also then and there produce, properly authenticated under his seal, copy of the testimony taken at the hearing held pursuant to the mandate of the warrant of arrest issued by the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to which complainant, Rudolf Tschahle, is restrained of his liberty by said Henry M. White.</p>

<p>Ruldoph Tschahle being first dully sworn says: That he is the complainant in the above entitled cause; and that he has read the foregoing complaint and knows the contents thereof, and that the same is true to his knowledge.</p>

<p>Rudolph Techahle.</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 9 day of December, 1918.</p>
