<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>EXHIBIT A</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application 
of Tonka Bajlo for the Writ of 
Habeas Corpus. 0</p>
<p>2459
No. 1328
AFFIDAVIT OF TONKA BAJLO</p>

<p>Tonka Bajlo being first duly sworn on oath deposes
and says: That I am the petitioner in the above entitled case,
and pray that a Writ of Habeas Corpus be issued discharging me
from <add>the custody of</add> the immigration officials in Seattle, Washington, where I
am now confined at the Immigration Station in said city; that
prior to my arrest on April 7, 1913, I was employed as housekeeper
and cook at 815 Charles Street, Seattle, Washington; that 
I had been serving in such capacity for a period of about three
months; that prior to such time I was employed at 917 Addition
Street, between 9th and 10th Streets in the City of Seattle, in 
the employ of a man by the name of Paska Bilin alias Joe Miler,
which letter name is the American name under which he seeks 
employment; that said Paska Bilin, alias Joe Miler, is an
acquaintance of Joe or John Jurin, and of my husband, Jack
Bajlo; that said John Jurin while at Pittsburg stopping at 
my boarding house, wrote a letter to Paska Bilin and asked him
to send him a ticket to come to Seattle, and that I obtained the 
address of said Paska Bilin, alias Joe Miler from the letter
which was left in the house by John Jurin after he left Pittsburg
for Seattle; that while living in Pittsburg my husband
beat me so terribly, knocked me down with his fists and jumped
on me with his feet, so that I was compelled to leave him and 
seek the protection of an American family; that I was at the
home of this American family for the period of three days
and my husband sent word through a woman acquaintance and asked
me to return to live with him as his wife, saying that if I returned
he would not be me anymore, and at the end of three
days I went back to live with him as his wife; that as soon as
<pb/>
I stepped into the house he grabbed me and threw me down on the 
floor and knocked my head against the wall and beat me into almost 
insensibility and I was sick ans sore for some days afterwards,
and while suffering from this beating after I had returned 
to him I had found the address of Paska Bilin in the house, and
I took what money there was in the house (, about $120.00,) and 
came to Seattle. My reason for coming to Seattle was to get
as far away from my husband as possible, so as to get away from
his inhuman treatment and continuous beatings; that when I came
here I went to the house of Paska Bilin on Addition Street, and
John Jurin was there and some other Austrian laborers; that I 
obtained employment as cook and housekeeper and each one of the
men who lived there gave me $2.50 per month. There were seven
of them there. That I never said to the interpreter who took
evidence in this case that I only received $2.50 per month from each of 
them while these men were there, and that while John Jurin and
Paska Bilin were living at the house alone they each gave me
$5.00 per month; that I remained there most of the time until
I went to 815 Charles Street; that I worked as cook in an Austrian
familiy for a day or two at a time; that when I went to 815 
Charles Street I worked for Ivan Scorich and Paska Bilin and 
some other Austrians who were living there, including John Jurin, 
and part of the time while working there they paid me $2.50 per
month each until I became sick, and then I was given the sum of 
$10.00 per month.</p>
<p>That I never indulged in any illicit intercourse
with any of the men while I was working at 917 Addition Street; 
that ever since <add>I have been in this country</add> I have been a true and virtuous wife, and never
had any intercourse of a sexual character with any man other than
my husband; that one of the reasons why I declined to live with 
my husband as his wife, is that he by physical force and brutality
compels me to submit to bestial acts of buggery; tha tin
the testimony wherein I am made to state that I had an illegitimate
<pb/>
<fw>-2-</fw>
child before my marriage. Such testimony is untrue, as I 
never had an illegitimate child prior to my marriage, and the
testimony of my husband substantiates said statement; that what
children I have who are now living,were born in lawful wedlock 
and are the children of Jack Bajlo, my husband, and he so
stated before the Immigrant Inspector; that when I came to this
country with my husband I begged him to bring our children, which
he refused to do. I have often requested him to bring our two
children to this country and he has declined to do so; that I 
desire to have my children with me and asked my husband to
send and get one, if he could not pay the passage of more than
one child at a time, and he has refused to do so; that I would
wash and scrub and take care of them; that said children are
with the mother of my husband, and my reasons for not going back
there are that while I lived there my husband beat me, and my
husband's brother beat me who lives at the house, and my husband's 
nephew beat me who lives at the house, and my life was a perfect
hell, and I would rather be dead than live in the old country
under such conditions. I have no relatives of my own there.</p>
<p>That at the hearing before the Commissioner of 
Immigration I did not understand the proceedings which were being 
conducted, and I did not understand that I could have the assistance
of friends to help me, and that when the Inspector at the conclusion 
of my testimony asked me if I wanted counsel I told him that I 
did not have any money to pay for any; that I did not mean to
waive the right of counsel if I could obtain one;</p>
<p>That since being here my husband has called where I 
was working and made threats against me, and in the presence of 
the interpreter and the Inspector of Immigration, Mr. Thomas M.
Fisher, he made threats against me if I stated to the interpreter 
that he had been insane in the old country. That then interpreter
did not translate my statements at the said hearing in a correct manner,
as they have been read to me from the testimony taken. That I 
do not believe that I had a fair hearing and state that the statements
made in my testimony before the Hon. Commissioner are not true 
<pb/>
<fw>-3-</fw>
wherein I am made to say in reply to the question:</p>
<p>Q. "Have you any statement you wish to make to show your
right to be and remain in the United States?" A. "No, I want 
to go back to my children."</p>
<p>That said answer to said question is untrue; that I 
did not make such a statement; that I would not go back to the
old country because I was continually being beaten up by my husband
and his relatives.</p>
<p>Previous to my arrest, some two or three months ago, 
my husband and I went to an attorney in the city of Seattle with 
a view of obtaining a divorce, but we were informed that I had
not lived in the State of Washington one year and could not get 
it; that I told my husband at the time that I could not live with
him, and that it is my understanding, knowledge and belief that
he has made this complaint against me on the sole ground that I
will not live with him as his wife. That I believe if I were
compelled to live with him that he would end my life through
his continuous beatings, and he has already beaten me so often
that I am unable to work as I used to.</p>
<p>That the statement of the Government physician that
I am suffering from an affliction which could be traceable to
gonorrhea is correct; that I suffered from gonorrhea some years
ago while in the old country, which disease was given to me by
my husband; that if I had an opportunity to present counterevidence
to the testimony taken at the hearing on April 7, 1913,
I could convince the officials that the evidence taken there is
untrue; that I have applied to the Commissioner of Immigration,
Ellis DeBruler, at the port of Seattle, for a rehearing and have
been refused.</p>
<ab>Tonka Bajlo</ab>
<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 30 day of 
April, 1913.</p>
