    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In November 1918, Martin de Wal petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds he was being unlawfully restrained of his liberty by Herny M. White, U.S. Commissioner of Labor. Martin was a subject of the Kingdom of Holland and was arrested by an Immigration Inspector charging de Wal with being an alien and having advocated or taught the unlawful destruction of property. At the initial hearing, de Wal stated he had never sold any book on sabotage and that he was against German militarism. The petition stated de Wal demanded a copy of said evidence against him in order to attach it to the petition but was refused by respondent Henry M. White. Judge Neterer denied the writ stating de Wal's case was similar to that of Samuel H. Dixon and Charles Bernat, whose writs were also denied. </li>
