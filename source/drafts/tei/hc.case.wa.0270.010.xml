<p>IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT,  FOR THE NINTH JUIDICIAL CIRCUIT, WESTERN  DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>


<p> In Re. Ex Parte: Donald MC Kerracher, Petitioner. Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>TO THE HONORABLE, THE ABOVE ENTITLED COURT, AND CORNELIUS H. HANFORD, Judge of the same: -</p>


<p>I.-</p>

<p> Comes now your petitioner, Donald MC Kerracher, a citizen of the United States and of the State of  Washington, and respectfully shows to your Honorable Court that he is unlawfully held in custody by C.B. Hopkins, United States Marshal for the District of Washington, in the United States penitentiary at McNeil's Island, in said State of Washington and within this District.-</p>

<p>II-</p>

<p> That your petitoner was sentenced upon the 14th day of  January, 1902, and arrived at said penitentiary and was then incarcerated on the 15th day of Janurary, 1902. That the sentence of the court before whom your petitioner was tried was that he should be confined in said penitentiary for the period of five,(5), years, and your petitioner has been incarcerated in said penitentiary under said sentence ever since his incarceration in said 15th day of January, 1902, and that all times since his incarceration in said penitentiary he has been a good prisoner, and for the record of his conduct shows that he has faithfully observed all of the rules and has not been subjected to punishment, and that he is entitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence to be estimated under the laws of the United States of America as commencing on the first day of his arrival at the penitentiary, which deduction, under the law of the United States of America, amounts to eight(8) days for each month of his sentence.  </p>


<p> III</p>

<p>  That your petitioner has not been sentenced under more than one sentence, but is incarcerated in said penitentiary under one sentence alone.</p>


<pb/>

<p> IIII</p>

<p> That under and by virtue of said sentence, and the condition and terms thereof, and the laws of the United States of America, your petitioner is entitled to a discharge from said penitentiary, and was so entitled to a discharge therefrom upon the 15th day of Septmenber, A.D.1905, is more fully shown by annexed report of O.P. <unclear>Heligan?</unclear>, Warden of the Government Penitentiary at McNeils Island, which is hereto annexed, marked " Exhibit A". and made part hereof: but that said United States Marshall refuses to discharge your petitioner from said penitentiary, although his time for which he was sentenced, after deducting "good time", as provided by the laws of the United States of America, has fully expired. </p>

<p> V</p>

<p> That your petitioner is a man of well established reputation, and was so at the time of his sentence. That he is in all respects entitled to the benefits of every law the United States providing for the incarceration and discharge of prisoners sentenced from any quarter of the United States to any jail or penitentiary therein.  

Wherefore, your petitioner prays that a writ of Habeas Corpus may issue out of and under the seal of this Honorable Court, directed to C.B. Hopkins, United States Marshal for this District, commanding him to have the body of your petitioner, together with the return of the date and cause of his detention, before this Honorable Court on a day to be designated therein, and that on such return and hearing had thereon, your petitioner may be discharged from said custody and imprisonment. And your petitioner will ever pray.    </p>

<p> United States of America, Ninth Judicial District, State of Washington, County of King,  ss.</p>

<p> J.B. Metcalfe, being first duly sworn, on oath deposes and says: That he is attorney for the petitioner above named: has read the foregoing petition, knows the contents thereof, and the facts therein stated are true. That he makes this affidavit upon behalf of the petitioner because the petitioner is now incarcerated in the penitentirary at McNeill's Island and cannot personally make this affidavit.</p>

<p> J.B. Metcalfe</p>
<p> Subscribed and sworn to before me this 18th of September, A.D. 1905. </p>

<p> "Exhibit A"</p>

<p> United States of America, Government Penitentiary, McNeil's Island </p>

<p> To the U.S. Marshall, </p>
<p> Seattle, Wash.</p>
<p>  Dear Sir:- </p>
<p> Donald MC Kerracher arrived at the penitentiary on the 15th day of January, 1902, and since said time has been a good and trusted prisoner, nad has not subjected himself to punishment of any kind, but is entitled to the <unclear> cull?</unclear> good time provided by law, whatever that may be dteremined to be. </p>
<p> If he is entitled to good time under  the law of 1908, the same should be figured as follows:  </p>
<p> Date of Sentence - 1902-1-14  </p>
<p> Sentence - 5- 0-0</p>
<p>Expiration  - 1907 - 1-13  Without "Good Time" </p>
<p> Arrival @ Penitentiary 1902-1-15 </p>
<p> " Good Time" allowed on  4 -11-28 = 58/28/ 30mo. @ 8 days per mo. =480 </p>
<p> Expiration of Sentence 1907 - 1- 13 Without " Good Time" </p>
<p>  " Good Time" 480 days = 1 - 4-0</p>
<p>  Expiration of Sentence 1905 - 9 - 13 With "Good Time" Allowance</p>
<p> and unclear this law he is entitled to discharge on the 13th of September, 1905m but you will understand that I do not attempt to determine wheter he is entitled to good time under the law of 1902. </p>
<p>  Very respectfully, .... </p>
