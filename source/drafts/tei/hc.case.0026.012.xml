<p> Hannah Lee being duly sworn on her oath saith--that some day 
last week Mrs Placket told her that whenever the girl now present made her angry 
she threw her on the fire and would do so again--that she saw 
Mr Placket take a broom handle and beat the said girl over the head 
&amp; that she also saw Mrs Placket do the same at a different time--that she saw 
the girl with a rope round her neck and Mrs Placket pulling her 
down stairs--</p>
