    <li>Summary of Proceedings: One June 2, 1917, 23-year old Margaret Holton was arrested without a warrant and incarcerated in the Omaha city jail. The Omaha Daily Bee states that it was for "forgery in the third degree." However, she was required to testify in St. Louis, Missouri regarding the trial of Paul O. Sommer, who was accused of embezzling $20,000 from the Holman company. Margaret used to be his assistant, making her testimony on his business dealings possibly very valuable. Assisted by her attorney Daniel Horrigan, she filed a writ of habeus corpus on June 4, 1917. She appeared in court on June 6, 1917, and was released on a $600 bail, with one W.N. Mace serving as surety. A continuation of the writ of habeus corpus and return was filed on June 7. The conclusion of the case is unclear, as no more records document Margaret's fate. According to the Omaha Daily Bee article, she was released on bail and went to testify in St. Louis. </li>
