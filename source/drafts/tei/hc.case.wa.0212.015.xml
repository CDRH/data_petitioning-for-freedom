<p>In the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>

<p>No. 5449</p>

<p>Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Taka Shibata for a Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>The petition of Taka Shibata respectfully shows to the court that she is imprisoned and restrained of her liberty by Hon. Henry M. White, United States Commissioner of Immigration at the United States Detention office in the city of Seattle, King County, Washington, and within said district; that said Taka Shibata is not committed or detained by virtue of any process issued or any final judgment or decree of any competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction or by virtue of an execution issued on such judgment or decree.</p>

<p>That the cause or pretense of such confinement or restraint according to the knowledge and belief of petitioner is that the said Taka Shibata was arrested under warrant issued by the Hon. Secretary of Labor of the United States on the alleged reasons that the said Taka Shibata is likely to become a public charge and on the further alleged grounds that the said Taka Shibata obtained admission into the United States through fraudulent means, to-wit, in this that said Taka Shibata is an alien, a subject of Japan and married one <unclear>Kumi Kieki Shibata</unclear> who was then residing in the United States for the alleged fraudulent purpose of obtaining admission into the United States as the wife of her said husband under and by virtue of the Immigration Laws ofnthe United States.</p>

<p>That said imprisonment and restraint are illegal according to the best knowledge and belief of said applicant for the reason that the evidence and testimony upon which the order of deportation was made is not sufficient to show that she is</p>

<pb/>

<p>subject to deportation or to show that she is guilty of any of the charges preferred against her and is not sufficient to give the Honorable Secretary of Labor, the Immigration Department, or any officer thereof jurisdiction to order her said deportation on the grounds alleged in the warrant of arrest under which she was apprehended and under which she is now being held and detained as aforesaid and for the further reason that the said petitioner did not have a fair hearing in said matter because of the fact that her testimony and that of her witnesses was totally disregarded and given no consideration whatever and the said petitioner was ordered deported without any evidence sufficient to sustain the charges made against her; that there was no evidence whatever <del>to</del> showing or tending to show as petitioner verily believes that she was guilty of any fraud whatever in procuring her admission into the United States or showing or tending to show that she is liable to become a public charge.</p>

<p>Your petitioner, therefore <del>believes</del> prays that a Writ of Habeas Corpus may issue directed to the said Henry M. White as United States Commissioner of Immigration of Seattle, Washington, commanding him that he have the body of the said Taka Shibata by him imprisoned and detained as aforesaid together with the time and cause of such imprisonment and detention before the Hon. <del>Edward M. Cushman</del> Frank H. Rudkin, United States District Judge of the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division, at such time and place as such court may desire, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered and <del></del> ordered concerning the said Taka Shibata in pursuance to the statute and laws in such case made and provided.</p>

<p>Dates this 12 day of July, 1920.</p>
