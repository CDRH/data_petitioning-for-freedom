    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Edward Thacker, father and guardian of Addie Thacker, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that Addie Thacker was being unlawfully detained by Dora Doyle. According to secondary research, Doyle was police matron. Judge Holmes granted the petition. After reviewing evidence, Holmes appointed W. W. Towle, attorney for petitioner, as the guardian of the bound party and ordered that the petitioner pay for the care and maintenance of bound party. All parties agreed to this new custody arrangement. By 1910, the father and daughter had moved to Colorado. </li>
