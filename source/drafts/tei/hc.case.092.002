<P>charged on oath of said Micheal Broderick before George N. Dwelly of Justice of the 
peace <unclear>Port Gamble?</unclear> precintint in said County of Kitsah with robbery in having
forciebly taken from the person of the said Broderick one gold finger ring, that upon
a hearing of said charge they said Sweeny and Finnegram in default of said,
were committed to the said appearances to await the action of the said district court
at the January term evening that there upon the said Micheal Broderick
and William Hughes were required to enter bail for their appearances at said term of
court as tributes in the case of the felonies in the price of $500., and in default of said
bail were cancelled to said all as a foresaid; That both said Sweeny and
Finnegram excepted from said jail on the 20th day of November, 1896 and are not now
within this territory as the plantiffs newly believe
What said restraint is illegal in this the assured of bail required is excessive
the justice of the peace should have taken the pardon reorganization of plantiffs
I have found plantiffs pray that a writ of Habeaus Corpus they have issued from this court directed to
the said Keeper commanding him to produce before you have the bodies of said plantiffs to be dealt with
according to the law.        C. D. Sweeney Ally for defense </P>
