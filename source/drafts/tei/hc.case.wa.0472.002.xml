from what you have reas?

and decided opinion?
A Yes sir. If it was true,
Q Welll, at any rate you now entertain an opinion that would re-

A Well, it would require some evidence, yes sir. Not particularly
strong evidence; it would require some evidence.
Q It would require some evidence of at least one witness?

tions were propounded to the said Isadoe Lipschuetz, and the said
Isador Lipschuetz deposed and testified under oath as follows:</p>
<p>Q What is your name?
A I. Lipschuetz.
Q Mr. Lipschuetz where do you live?
A Here in Spokane
Q How long have you lived here, Mr. Lipschuetz?
A About eight years.
Q Are you a married man?
A Yes sir.
Q Your family live here?
A Yes sir.
Q What is your business?
A I am a barber.
Q Where is your place of business?
A 515 Main Street.
Q Do you know the defendant, George Webster?
A I do not.
Q Do you know his attorneys, Mr. Fenton and Mr. Smith?
A No.
Q Do you know anything about the facts in this case?
A No Sir.
Q Have you read anything in the paper about it?
A I did.
Q Did you read what purported to be the report of the shooting
immediately after it occurred, in the paper?
A I read about it in the papers.
Q From the reading of those reports, or from any other reason,
did you form or express any opinion as to the guilt or innocence
of the defendant.
A No sir.
Q Have you now any opinion as to his guilt or innocence?
A No sir.
Q Mr. Lipschuetz, do you understand the meaning of the term
circumstantial evidence?
A Yes sir.
Q What is your notion about that?
A My notion about the meaning of the term circumstantial evidence
is that circumstances, not witnesses, or the things connecting 
the defendant with the case.
Q Would the trial of a cause be willing to convict the defendant
upon purely, solely circumstantial evidence?
A If there was no doubt about the guilt I would.
Q Taking a chain of circumstances that point to the guilt
of a defendant, would you be willing wholly upon circumstantial
evidence to convict in a case of murder in the first degree,
where you knew that your verdict would mean the hanging of a man?
A If there was no doubt or question in my mind that according to 
the evidence he was guilty.
Q Could you remove all doubt from your mind
by hearing of circumstantial evidence only?
A That would depend on how strong the evidence was,
Q If it was strong enough, you think circumstantial evidence alone 
could remove any doubt from your mind as completely as if you
heard witnesses who saw the transaction?
A Well, I would certainly give the prisoner the beneifit of the 
doubt if there was any exisiting.
Q You should enter upon the trial of the cause with a doubt in
your mind in any case, would you not? Would you not give the
prisoner the benefit of the presumption of innocence starting
out in the trial?
A Yes Sir.
Q Then you would start in the trial of any case with a doubt in
your mind in favor of the prisioner?
A Well, I had not thought of the guilt of the prisoner.
Q You mean that you would rely on the presumption of his inn-
ocence until you have heard the evidence?
A Yes sir,
Q Then you hage a doubt in favor of the prisioner in any event in
starting out in a trial?
A Yes, I suppose so.
Q Now, starting out with that doubt, or with that idea of the pre-
sumption of the innocence of the defendant until he is proven guity
could circumstantial evidence alone remove that doubt or remove
the presumption of innocence that would be in your mind?
A Yes sir.
 Q Have you any opinion, Mr. Lipschuetz which would preclude you
from rendering a verdict of guilty in any case, where the offence 
would be punished by penalty of death?
A No sir.
Q You have no conscientious scruples against hanging?
A No.
Q What is your nationality?
A I was born in Germany
Q Do you belong to any secret society here?
A None whatever.
</p>
<p>The Prosecuting Attorney passed said juror for cause.
The said juror, I. Lipschuetz upon examination of Mr. Fenton
of counsel for defendant, deposed as follows:</p>
<p>Q Have you read anything about this case?
A I have
Q When was that?
A At the time the shooting ocurred last spring.
Q When was that?
A Sometime last spring, when it took place.
Q Have you talked about this case, State against Webster?
A Nothing but comment upon what I read.
Q Have you talked with anyone else about the case?
A No sir.
Q Now from what you have read about the case, and from what you
have heard about it, have you formed any opinion as to the guilt
or innocence o the defendant?
A I never form an opinion on newspaper talk.
Q Have you now any opinion as the the guilt or innocence of the de-
fendant?
A None whatsoever.
Q Have you any opinion as to whether or not Mrs. Aspland was kille
A Only from what I saw in the papers. I have no opinion about it.
Q What is that?
A Only what I saw in the papers?
Q Have you any such opinion that would require evidence to change?
A Evidence to change my opinion?
Q Have you now such an opinion as to require evidence to change
that opinion?
A No sir.
Q You say you would convict a person charged with murder in the 
first degree wholly on circumstantial evidence?
A If there was not adooubt as to the evidence as to his being guilty.
Q Suppose that the evidence was slight and circumstantial, would
you then have any conscientious scruples against convicting?
A No sir, I would not.
Q What is your business?
A I am a barber.
Q Where is your place of business?
A 515 Main Street.
Q Are you acquainted with Mr. Pierce?
A Not personally, but I know him when I see him.
Q Are you acquianted with Mr. Fitzgerald?
A. Only by sight.
Q Are you acquainted with Mr. Baldwin?
A No sir
Q Or Mr. Aspland?
A No sir.
Q Did you ever sit on a jury before?
A I sat in a justice court once.
Q Did you ever sit as a juror in this Court before, or any other
district or superior court?
A No sir.
Q If the defendant should go upon the witness stand and testify in
his own behalf, cud you give his testimony the same weight and
credit as that of ay other witness similarly situated?
and surrounded by the same circumstances?
A Yes sur.
Q Would the fact that he should not go upon the witness stand
raise any nference in your mind as to his guilt?
A None whatever.
Q You think that you could give the defendant the benefit of all
resonable doubt?
A Yes sir.
Q Do you know anything that would prevent you from being a fair
and impartial juror?
A Not to my knowledge,
Q Should the jury in this case, a majority of them, be against your
opinion after hearing the evidence, do you think that you could
adhere to the opinion you had formed in your own consciousness
after hearing the evidence
A I certainly could.
Q You think that your verdict would be based upon the evidence as
you understood it and not upon the understanding of your fellow
jurors?
A Yes sir.
Q You are a marrued man?
A. Yes sir.
</p>
<p>The defendant passed said juror for cause.</p>
<p>That the foregoing questions were all the questions propounded
to the juror, Isador Lipschuetz, and the foregoing answers to said
questions were all the testimony and questions of the Juror Isador
Lipschuetz upon his examination as said Juror in said cause and said
juror gave no other testimony upon his said examination.</p>
 <p>Whereas in truth and in fact the said Isador Lipschuetz at the
 time of his said examination as juror, had not been a resident of
 the City of Spokane or the State of Washington, for the period of
 eight years, and in truth and in fact had not been a resident of the
 State of Washington for the period of one year next before the time
 that he the said Juror Isador Lipschuetz was being examined touching
his qualifications to sit as a Juror in said cause, which he the
said Juror Isador Lipschuetz then and there well knew; and in truth
and in fact the said Juror Isador Lipschuetz voted at the town of
Wallace in voting Precinct No. 2 at the general election held in said
Precinct, in the State of Idaho on the 3rd day of November A. D. 
1896, and in truth and in fact resided in the State of Idaho until
the 1st day of Janurary, A. D. 1897. And the said petitioner, rela-

  chuetz although pretending at the tim of said extremeisnm not to
know anything about the facts in the case and that he had formed 
no opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the said relator and pe-
titioner upon said charge, had in fact previous to the commencement
 of said trial of the said relator upon said information, fully dis-
 cussed the facts in said case and had in fact previous to his being 
 called as a juror in said case, formed and expressed an opinion that
  the said petitioner and relator was guilty of the offense charged in
 said nformation and in truth and in fact the said juror Isador Lips-
 chuetz upon his said examination as said juror, in order to remain
 upon said jury and in order to prevent the said defendaht from chal-
 lenging the said juror for cause on account of the expressed and im-
plied bias, testified and swore falsely touching the length of time

er and relator herein further alleges; that neither he nor his said

on their said verdict, he the said juror Isidor Lipschuetz
was in posession of facts within his own knowledge, and facts that
had not been testified to by any of the witnesses upon the trial of
such cause that conviced him, the said juror Isidor Lipschuetz be-
yound a reasonable doubt that the said petitioner, relator and defend-
and was guilty of the crime charged in the said information, and that
the said petitioner, relator and defendant herein should be hanged
for said offense. And the same petitioner, relator and defendant 
herein alleges, that neither he nor his said attorneys jad any know-

in the cause had been offered, and repeatedly said to the affiant
in the jury room "I would like to see Webster taken out of the
jail right now and hung without any further trial or delay of any
kind".</p>
