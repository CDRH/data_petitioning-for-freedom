    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On November 25, 1887, Alice McKay filed a petition for a second writ of Habeas Corpus in King County Third District Court to receive custody of her eight-year-old daughter, Mary, from the custody of John and Della Keevan. Mary had been living with the Keevans for five years, the Sisters of Charity (Sisters of Providence) having placed Mary with them after Alice placed her daughter into the care of the sisters in 1882 while receiving medical treatment. Shortly after, Alice petitioned for custody of Mary. After having her initial writ denied, Alice utilized a different legal strategy in her second writ. Alice argued to Judge Roger Greene that the Keevans were unfit parents for Mary due to their Catholicism and that they were denying her visitation without reason. The Keevans argued that Alice was a drunk, immoral, abusive, and living in adultery with her neighbor Antone, "a dark Italian." Alice countered by claiming that the Keevans were similarly immoral, and that her previous encounters with the law were due to abuse she faced from her now estranged husband, R. G. McKay. Before the court ordered a decision in the case of Mary's custody, Alice and her daughter, Katie, abducted Mary from the Keevans' home the day after Mary's twelfth birthday in 1891. Shortly after, the court ordered Alice to return Mary to the Keevans and Judge Isaac Lichtenberg, who took the case upon the death of Judge Jones, granted custody of Mary to the Keevans. A month after the ruling, Alice and her attorneys filed evidence to the court showing of Della's purchase of alcohol and personal correspondences indicating alcohol abuse. A year after the decision, the Keevans were granted a divorce on account of "mutual abuse." </li>
