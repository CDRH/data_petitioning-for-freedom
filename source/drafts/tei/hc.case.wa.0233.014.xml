<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND LABOR
Immigration Service,</p> 
<p>No. 114/6-5</p> 
<p>Office of Inspector
Port of Spokane, Washington
February 8, 1912.</p> 
<p>Mr. Thomas Fisher,
Inspector, 
Seattle, Wash.</p>
<p>(Through Official Channels.)</p> 
<p>S i r:
I have to report that Mr. Plastino, the elder,
brought in his Declaration of Intention as requested.</p>
<p>This declaration was filed in the Superior
Court of this County June 9, 1900. The paper is made out in
the name of Meikele Plastino but is signed as Michele Plastino.
No other data is given except that he is a native of Italy.</p>
<p>Respectfully,
(Sg.) A. F. Richardson,
Chinese Inspector.</p> 
<p>Exhibit "A"</p>    
<pb></pb> 
<p>Statement of GOLDIE CARDIFF, relating to Sam Plastino
made to Inspector A.F. Richardson, at Spokane, Wash.,</p> 
<p>No. 4250-5 April 25, 1911.</p> 
<p>By Mr. Richardson: Where were you born? a BY GOLDIE CARDIFF. In
Pendelton, Oregon.</p> 
<p>Q What is your name? A Goldie Cardiff.</p> 
<p>Q How old are you? A Twenty (20), 21 in November.</p> 
<p>Q You say that you are a friend of Sam Plastino's. Now I wish
you could tell me about that; your relation with him when did
you first meet him? A Two and a half years ago. I was then on the
stage with the Herberts, a vaudeville team. I met him at a dance hall;
I met him just a few times then I didn't see him until last September
(1910).</p> 
<p>Q How was that? A I met him in a dance hall again. He asked me to go
out and I went to a noodle joint with him. He took me to the Rochester
Hotel that night; I think it was room 27 or 28; the room next to the
corner room. That was about the 13th of September, 1910. Then he
ma made a date for the next day at Kemp and Herbert's store but I didn't
see him there. The same day he tried to make a date to send me to
Seattle with him.</p> 
<p>Q Did you go? A Yes, I went that night on the Great Northern, with
Sam, at 8 PM, the train being late. When we got to Seattle we went
to the Idaho Hotel. The next night we were at the Rex Hotel. On the
Friday following he brought some short dresses to me and said he
wanted me to go into a dance hall.</p>
<p>Q Who had paid your way and you expenses to Seattle? A Sam paid for
everything.</p>
