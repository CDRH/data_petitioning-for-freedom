      <p class="tei_p">State of Missouri, 
County of St. Louis } ss. Before me, the undersigned, a 
Justice of the Peace within and for the County aforesaid, personally came George Henley, who being duly sworn on his oath 
deposeth &amp; saith as follows, to wit: I know the man (colored) 
John Black, alias Crawley. The last time I saw him absent 
from the State of Missouri, was at Mobile, State of Alabama, 
I knew him then as the slave property of one Stephen Gardier 
of the twelve mile point or Ashwood Landing, State of Illinois, and is at present at large in said County without 
knowledge or consent of owner. I know that he is a runaway 
slave, and believe him still to be the property of said Stephen 
Gardier. Said slave is the man now produced before said 
Justice.</p>
