<p>EXHIBIT B</p>
<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application 
of Tonka Bajlo for the Writ of
Habeas Corpus )</p>

<p>2459
No. 1328</p>

<p>AFFIDAVIT OF NICK RADOVICH</p>
<p>STATE OF WASHINGTON 
COUNTY OF KING ) ss.</p>

<p>Nick Radovich being first duly swon on oath deposes and
says: That I am a citizen of the United States and a resident
of Seattle, <add>an Austrian by birth</add> and have resided here about 28 years; that I raised
my family here and am a married man; that I am at present conducting
a lunch counter in the Frog Solo Bar, corner of 3rd and Pike
Streets; that on monday, April 28th, 1913, Chas. H. Ennis, in
company with Jack Bajlo, called upon me at my place of business
and requested me to act as interpreter at an interview, and in
reply to my questions he <add>Jack Bajlo</add> gave me the following answers:</p>
<p>Q. Why do you say your wife is a dirty old whore? A. Because
she will not live with me.</p>
<p>Q. Is that the only reason why <add>you say</add> she is a dirty whore? A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Would you call her a dirty, old whore if she would live
with you? A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Why did you have her arrested? A. I had her arrested
and sent back home because she would not live with me. </p>
<p>Q. Then if she was willing to live you you would not 
send her back home? A. No. I do same all old country
style. Make her fear me. She know I boss.</p>
<p>I asked him who told him that his wife was sleeping
with the men where she worked and he said another Austrian, and 
then I asked him who he was and he said that he did not know his
name, and then I asked him where said Austrian could be found and
he said that he did not know. When questioned about the men, who
they were, and where they could be found he did not seem to have

<pb/>

anyone in mind at all; that he seemed to be lying and not at
all sincere about his statements that his wife was a prostitue,
or that she had been living with these men, and he said that previous 
to their marriage he knew her to be a virtuous girl.</p>
<ab>N Radovich</ab>
<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 2nd day of May, 1913.</p>
<ab>Chas H Ennis<lb/>
Notary Public in and for the State
of Washington, residing at Seattle.</ab>
