<p>IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT
OF WASHINGTON, SOUTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application
of
YO YOU JAM, for Writ of Habeas Corpus.} No. 3395
POINTS AND AUTHORITIES.</p>
<p>It is <del>contended</del> comended that the judgement of the Immigration
authorities upon the question of citizenship is final, but this
judgement must be sound and not capricious, and founded upon substantial
evidence. A citizen of the United States, or a son of
a citizen of the UNited States cannot be banished from his home
upon <del>insufficient</del> suspicion conjecture and distrust. That the Immigration
Department did not fully have the case in mind, and did not give
the subject the full and careful hearing which the law requires
is demonstrated by the ruling of the Hon. Henry M. White, Commissioner
of Immigration, which ruling in set forth in the transcript, 
and in as follows:</p>
<p>"After carefully considering the evidence presented
in the above entitled matter I find that YO YOU JAM is
not the minor son of a domiciled exempt, as claimed,
but in more than twenty- one years of age, a married man,
the father of one child and therefore the head of a 
household of his own.</p>
<p>It is order that he be and he is hereby rejected,
and denied admission to the United States and that he
be returned to the country whence he came to wit,
China, by and at the expense of the steamship company
bringing him to this country.
Henry M. White,
Commissioner."</p>
<p>It will be noticed that the petitioner is excluded from
the United States on the ground that he is not the minor son of a
domiciled exempt, as claimed. The petitioner in this notion did 
not seek admission as the minor as the minor son of a domiciled exempt, but
did, and is seeking admission into the United States as the son
of his father, who is a native born citizen of the United States.</p>
<pb/>
<p>The Commissioner did not make any finding upon the relationship 
of father and son. Subsequently thereto, however, on
June 20, 1916, John H. Sargent, a deputy Commissioner, made a 
further finding and Order, as follows:</p>
<p>"After carefully considering the evidence presented
in the completed record in the above entitled matter, I
find that YO YOU JAM is not the son of Yo Bing Goe, as
claimed, but is an alien Chinese, not a member of any
of the exempt classes, and not entitled to admission
to the United States.</p>
<p>It is ordered that he be and he is hereby rejected 
and denied admission to the United States, and that he 
be returned to the country whence he came, to-wit:
China, by and at the expense of the steamship company
bringing him to this country.
John H. Sargent,
Commissioner."</p>
<p>This matter involves a serious question; the status of 
the father as an American citizen is not in question; that 
Yo Bing Goe is a native born citizen of the United States is admitted.
Therefore, if the petitioner of this country cannot be denied
If he, your petitioner, was seeking admission as a citizen of the
United States, the finding on that question, if based upon sound
judgement and without abuse to the substantial rights of the applicant,
would be final. But the question herein involved presents 
an entirely different proposition. The question presented, is
Yo You Jam, the son of Yo Bing Goe, and we do most earnestly contend
that upon that important question, a decision by a political
officer is not final, but is subject to review by this Honorable
Court; that the status of the offspring of a citizen of the United 
States can not be fully and finally determined by a political officer.</p>
<p>"The law recognizes nop distinction of color or
race in the parental relation, but all parents,
whatsoever may be their standing in society, have
precisely the same authority and control over their 
children."
People vs. People, S Howard Practise, N.Y.</p>
<pb/>
<p>"Parents have the natural right to the custody and
control of their children; the paretns' rights to the
custody of the child is, however, not absolute, but 
subject to the judicial control when the safety or the interests
of the child demand it, and must yield whenever
the real or permanent interest demand it."
Cyc. SO Practice, Vol. 29, p.15.</p>
<p>"The rights of parents are, however, entitled to
great consideration, and courts should not deprive the
parent of the custody of his child without good cause."
Cyc. Vol. 29, p 1588.</p>
<p>"The law watched with jealous care, and courts will
assumed jurisdiction over children whenever the safety 
or welfare of the child demands it. So, in this case,
the Petitioner sets forth the fact that he is a native
born citizen of the United States, and that his safety
demands of this court the protection that a child of
a native born citizen is entitled to. The rights and
obligations of parents and child does not necessarily continue
or terminate upon the child's attaining majority,
but may, by consent, continue in full force after such
time."
Cyc. Vol. 29, p. 1583</p>
<p>The petitioner contends that he is being subjected to
the deprivation of rights, privileges and immunities secured to
him by each of the following provisions of the Constitution of
the United States, to- wit:
First- "Nor shall any state deprive any person of 
life or liberty, without due process of law."
Second- "Nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the law."</p>
<p>The petitioner in this case is being deprived of there rights,
privileges and immunities under color of that <del>section of</del>that<unclear>certain of</unclear>
<del>Revised Statutes of the United States.</del> November 3rd <unclear>1890</unclear><unclear></unclear></p>
<p>The acts set forth in petitioner's petition for a writ
of Habeas Corpus were done under color of any statute, ordinance,
regulation, custom or usage of any state or territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected any citizen of the United 
States, or other person within the jurisdiction thereof,
to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or imunities
secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to 
the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity or
other proper proceedings for redress."</p>
<pb/>
<p>Lord Eldon in DeManneville vs. Demannevile, 10 Ves.
52, said that he, as Judge, exercising the authority of the king,
as parens patriae, removed children from the custody of the father,
when he thought such custody unsuitable.</p>
<p>In Storey's Equity Jurisprudence, p. 1341, the author
says:
"The jurisdiction of the court of chancery extends
to the care of the person or infant for its due management
and satisfaction and proper application for its
maintenance; it is upon the former principal, that
is to say, for the due protection and education of
the infant that the court interferes with the ordinary
rights of parents, as guardians by nature or by nurture.
Wherever the parents are in constant habits of
drunkeness or blasphemy or low and gross debauchery,
or that the domestic associations are such as to tend
to corrupt and contaminate the children, in every such
case, the court of chancery will interfere and deprive
the parents of the custody of the children, and appoint
a suitable person to act as guardian and to take care
of them and superintend their education."</p>
<p>If, under the common law, the King stood as paren patriae
and removed children from the custody of their parents when he
thought such custody unsuitable, and if a state has jurisdiction
to remove children from the custody for their
protection and education, the Government, acting through the
court, certainly has the power to take the child of an native born
citizen from a political officer who has unjustly deprived him of
a substantial right, and particularly so, where that political 
officer threatend to legally banish the child from the country 
of his father's nativity. We admit that the mere quetion of citizenship
is determined by the Immigration Department, but we most
earnestly contend that the relationship existing between a native
born citizen of the United States and his son is not finally determined 
by a political officer; but that a child seeking to establish
his statue as the offspring of a citizen is entitled to 
have a judicial determination upon that question. </p>
<pb/>
<p>We further contend that there is no evidence to sustain
the findings of the Commissioner, but on the other hand, there is
substantial evidence to establish the fact that the petitioner is
the son of Yo Bing Goe. Whether or not this petitioner shall be 
bastardized and banished from the land of his father's nativity,
and whether or not a citizen of this country shall be deprived
of the society, service, aid and comfort of his son is the issue
herein involved. The sacred rights of parent and child cannot,
we believe, be finally determined by a political officer. If so,
then no citizen is safe in permitting a son or daughter to leave
the United States.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,
John J. Sullivan
Attorneys for Petitioner.</p>
