      <p class="tei_p">In the District Court
of the Fourth Judicial
District holding terms
at Spokane Falls.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington<br/>
vs.<br/>
Ray Raymond</p>

      <p class="tei_p">W.A. Gibbons
being duly sworn on my
oath depose and say that
I am now and have been
for the past twenty years a 
resident of Hangman Creek <span class="tei_add">Precinct</span> Spokane
County Washington Territory.
That I have heard that there 
was such a case as that above
named. That I am well acquainted 
with the people residing in said Hangman 
Creek precinct and have personal 
acquintance with the
greater part of them. That I have
had opportunity to hear the 
opinion and sentiment of
the people of said precinct
expressed and in a general
way know the same. That
I have never heard any expressions 

<span class="hr"> </span>

of hostility to or 
prejudice against the said defendant 
Ray Raymond in said
precinct. That if there were
any such expressions of prejudice 
or ill will by the people
of said precinct against said
defendant I should certainly
have heard them. That from
my first information the alleged 
facts relating to the homicide 
out of which said action 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">great[?]</span> are not sufficiently
known to the people of said
precinct to have enabled them
to give an opinion for the
guilt or innocence of said defendant. 
And affiant further
saith that there are about
four hundred people living
in said Hangman Creek precinct
and that he verily believes that
a large number of legally qualified
 jurors can be secured
in said precinct to serve
as jurors said action
and further affiant saith not.</p>

me this tenth say of December
A.D. 1886.</p>
