<p>No. 1390</p>

<p>In the Circuit Court of the United States</p>

<p>for the W. Dist. of Washington Northern Division</p>

<p>In the matter of the application of Columbia George for a writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Certificate</p>

<p>Filed in the U.S. Circuit Court. APR 27 1906, A. Reeves Ayres, Clerk. By HM Matthew, Deputy.</p>

<pb/>

<p>In the United States Circuit Court for the Western District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Columbia George for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. No. 1390.</p>

<p>I hereby certify that before the commencement of the argument in this matter, Mr. R. J. Slater, of counsel for the
   petitioner in the above entitled proceeding, offered in evidence in support of the application of Columbia George for
   a writ of habeas corpus in this matter, a patent of the Untied States issued to Columbia George for certain lands scheculed
   to the said Columbia George as his allotment, and which patent is dated September 16, 1899. To the introduction of this patent
   the United States Attorney objected, upon the grounds following, to-wit:</p>

<p>1st. That the same was incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial.</p>

<p>2nd. That the judge of the above entitled court on the application for a writ of habeas corpus could not look or go behind
   the record to review the proceedings of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Oregon, the court in which
   the applicant had been tried, convicted and sentenced, and which court was, and is, a court of coordinate jurisdiction with
   the above entitled court.</p>

<p>3rd. That the above entitled court in this proceeding was not authorized to receive, and could not lawfully act on, evidence
   extrinsic of the record of</p>

<pb/>

<p>the United States Circuit Court for the District of Oregon, the court and district in which the said Columbia George was tried,
   convicted and sentenced.</p>

<p>4th. That at the present stage of the proceeding, the introduction of the patent was irregular and not authorized.</p>

<p>5th. For the reason that the said patent was not introduced in evidence, nor offered in evidence, during the trial of the said
   Columbia George in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Oregon, nor were the contents, nor the existence
   of said patent made known to said court at said time or attempted to be proven, which objections were sustained by the court,
   to which ruling of the court the petitioner, through his counsel, R. J. Slater, excepted, and which exception was allowed; that  
   by stipulation the said United States patent was allowed to be withdrawn and a copy thereof substituted, which for 
   identification is marked Petitioner's Exhibit "A". Petitioner also at said time in support of his application for a writ of
   habeas corpus, offered in evidence what purported to be a certified copy of a portion of the testimony of witnesses B.F. McElroy
   and Joseph Craig, given during the trial of said petitioner in the Untied States Circuit Court for the Distrcit fo Oregon, which
   certified copy of said testimoney for identification is marked Petitioner's Exhibit "B". To the introduction of said testimony
   the Respondents objected, for the reason, first, that the same was incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and, second,         
   petitioner's exhibit "B" only purported to contain a part of the testimony of the witnesses named therein, and did not contain   
   all the testimony of said</p>

<pb/>

<p>witnesses named therein, nor all the testimony produced at the trial of the said petitioner in the United States Circuit Court 
   for the District of Oregon, and that it would be clearly improper to admit only a portion of the testimony taken during said trial,
   and third,, that by the introduction of a certified copy of a portion of the purported testimony taken and introduced during the
   trial of the petitioner in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Oregon in the case entitled United States of America,
   plaintiff, vs. Columbia George and Toy Toy, defendants, the petitioner calls upon the above entitled court, which is a court of
   coordinate jurisdiction with the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Oregon, to review proceedings of said Circuit
   Court of the Untied States for the District of Oregon, which objections were sustained yb the court, to which ruling of the court the
   petitioner, through his counsel, R.J. Slater, excepted, which exception was allowed. Also at said time, the petitioner offered in
   evidence in support of his application, a certified copy of a portion of the record in the case of United States of America, plaintiff,
   vs. Columbia George and Toy Toy, defendants, which for convenience is marked Petitioner's Exhibit "C", and as the matters and things
   set forth therein are already admitted by the petition, answer and return thereto, the respondents make no objection to the  
   introduction of Petitioner's Exhibit "C".</p>

<p>This certificate is made for the purpose of completing the record, and showing the things that occured on the hearing in this    
   matter not already</p>

<pb/>

<p>shown by the record herein.</p>

<p>Dated at Seattle, Washington, this 27th day of April 1906.</p>

<p>C.H. Hanford, Judge</p>
