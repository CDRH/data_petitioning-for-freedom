      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington<br/>
County of Spokane} <br/>
In the District Court of the 4th Judicial District 
holding terms
at county seat of Spokane
County.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington<br/>
vs.<br/>
Ray Raymond</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington
County of Spokane} ss</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I J. Kennedy
Stout being first duly sworn say: I 
am one of the attorneys of defendant
herein. I believe defendant cannot
have a fair trial in this cause in
Spokane County because of the
excitement and prejudice of the
people of the court, against her and
the reasons of such belief are fully
set forth in the affidavit of Thomas
C. Griffitts herein, which I have
heard read and most of the facts
therein stated I know to be true of
my own knowledge and expressing
the facts stated therein as to what
occured at the preliminary examination 
of defendant and in procuring
her bail, I know of my own knowledge
and that same are true, I was extensively 

<span class="hr"> </span>

acquained in Spokane County
and during said preliminary examination 
and since I have conversed
with a great many men and women 
resident in said county
and have heard many false and
exagerated statements of what
purported to be the facts in this case
and have often heard it stated that
defendant had therefore murdered
her husband and had murdered
two men and one woman in
Montana, and that she was a 
dangerous, quarrelsome women
cruel and wanton in the use of
firearms and many other
statements prejudicial to deft
and have heard many expressions 
of bitter prejudice against
defendant and an almost
universal expression of belief in
her guilt of the offense with which
she is charged in this indictment
and have heard many persons say
if she was not guilty she ought to be
hung anyhow on general principles
and from such conversations and
all that I know concerning the
feelings and opinions of the people of

<span class="hr"> </span>

said county I am convinced and
verily believe that defendant cannot
have a fair trial in said Spokane County
in this case and that a change
of the place of trial is necessary in
order that she may be tried by disinterested 
triers.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I do not believe that a jury of twelve
men could be drawn in this court, leaving 
out the recognized criminal or outlaw element
who would dare acquit defendant if
the territory failed to make out any
case against her, on account of fear of
general abuse afterwards, and reproaches 
from the public and their own families.</p>

before me this 2d day
of December 1886</p>
