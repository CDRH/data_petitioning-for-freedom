To the Honorable James C Moody one of the Judges of the Circuit Court of St Lewis
Co

The petition of Elizabeth Bird a resident of the city of St Louis respectfully shows
that Missouri Bird an infant aged about ten years, and placed by the mother thereof
under the  care and control of this petition until said child should become of age
is now retrained of its liberty by one Mrs Pattmore in this that said child is confined
at the house of said Pattmore and by her not permitted to return unto this petitioner
its true and lawful Custodian and that said Missouri Bird is so confined and restrained
at a house on Eleventh Street between Cass and &amp; O'Fallen Street, occupied by said
Miss Pattmore as this petitioner is informed and that according to the best knowledge
and belief of your petitioner the cause or pretense of the abovesaid confinement or
restraint of said Missouri Bird arrises from a pupose of said Mrs Pattmore to secure
and extort from said child its services as servant without compensation resource or
promise of some or other compensation your petitioner further states that no application
for the relief sought has been made to or refused by any court office or offices superior.
to the one to which this petition is presented and your petitioner further states

that she is advised by her counsel Messrs Clark &amp; Coonley of City of St Louis and
she so believes that the confinement and restraint aforementioned is illegal and that
said illegality consists in the refusal of said Mrs Pattmore to permit said child
to return to its lawful custodian and in depriving your petitioner of the control
and services of said child

Wherefore your petitioner prays a writ of Habeas Corpous to the end that said Missouri
Bird, by which name she is usually known, may be discharged from the restraint &amp; control
of said Miss Pattmore and returend to the care and custody of your petitioner
