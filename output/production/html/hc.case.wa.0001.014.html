X 2 wounds on body might have been made by a spent bullet  Never had experience with this <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">hit[?]</span> in that location on the heart my opinion is expertly spoken does not think if clothing on and hit sufficient to cause this mark think it would knock him down - average thickness of an adult mans skull would say from my experience say 1/4 or 3/8 and 1/2 inch - The skull varies in thickness — there is different in thickness in skull of different people</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Re X

It would depend somewhat on the weight and momentum - supposing a man was struck sufficiently with and in as much weighing 1/2 an ounce to produce the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> described would it knock him down - I think not it might knock him down - Death results from fracture of the skull producing both concussion and compression of the brain</p>
