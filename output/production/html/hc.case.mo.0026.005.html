Seventeenth day of December in the year Eighteen hundred 
and twenty five before me Peter Ferguson a Justice of the 
Peace in and for the County of St. Louis, personally came 
and appeared Jabez Warner who lodged information <del>upon</del> 
before me <del>that</del> upon oath that he is well informed &amp; does  
believe that John Plackett &amp;   <span class="tei_gap">[]</span>      Plackett his wife have 
a certain Female slave of the age of from Eight to Eleven 
years <del>of age</del> whose name is to him unknown that  
from the barbarous &amp; inhuman treatment as has been represented to him (and as he believes to be the truth) he thinks 
that the said child is in danger of being brought to a premature death, and that therefore a warrant ought to issue to 
cause the said Plackett &amp; his wife to be brought before some 
competent authority to restrain them from the continuance 
of such barbarity. to place the slave who has been thus 
inhumanly treated out of their power &amp; to cause them 
to give security to keep the peace towards the good people 
of this state &amp; to such others as the <del>proper</del> law may  
require &amp; to be otherwise dealt with according to laws</p>
