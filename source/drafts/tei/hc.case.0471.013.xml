NORTHERN DIVISION.

In re SALFEST S. SYLVESTER for a 
Writ of Habeas Corpus.

Affidavit.

STATE OF WASHINGTON
County of King.

ss

JOHN B. HART being first duly sworn, upon oath
deposes and says: I am one of the deputy prosecuting attorneys in and for
King County, Washington; that the respondent herein and the State of
Washington make this application for the reason that it is the intent,
so affiant has been informed and believes, of the authorities of the
state of North Dakota to prepare new requisition papers so as to
extradite the petitioner from this state to that state; that the said
petitioner is a fugitive from the justice of the state of North Dakota,
he having committed the crime of embezzlement, amounting to several
hundred dollars; that the means of knowledge that this affiant has of
the intent of the authorities of North Dakota to make out new extradition
papers and demand the return of said petitioner to that state are
based on conversations had with the respondent Wenaas in this case, who
heretofore has been in this cause the accredited agent of the State of
North Dakota; also on two telegrams received on July 3rd, 1899, by
Mr. James F. McElroy, prosecuting Attorney of King County, one being
from the Governor of the State of North Dakota, which is hereto attached
and made a part hereof, the other being from one J. F. Selby who is
the Prosecuting Attorney of Traill County, North Dakota, which is hereto
attached and made a part hereof. 

Affiant further states that it is alleged in various papers hereunto
exhibited in court that the crime with which said petitioner is
charged in North Dakota is alleged to have been committed in said Traill
County, North Dakota.

<pb/>

Affiant further believes that the period of ten days from the 
date hereof will be sufficient time within which to allow the authorities
of North Dakota to prepare new requisition papers and procure the warrant
from the Governor of this state for the extradition of the
petitioner to the state of North Dakota. 

Further affiant sayeth not.
