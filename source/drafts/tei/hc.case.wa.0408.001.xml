of court, officer, or body having authority in the premises to
commit; nor upon any warrant issued from the district court upon an indictment
or information; that the cause of pretence of such imprisionment
according to the best knowledge and belief of your petitioner, is
aas follows, to wit: a warrant issued outof a court of the Justice of

one of the Justices of the Peace in and for said precinct, on the 11th
day of March 1884, directed to the Sheriff or any Constable of said County,

with having committed the crime of Grand Larceny on the ..........
day of .................... 1884, by feloniously stealing a horse in
<pb></pb>

complaint therein contained is made from information received by telegram,
recieved that date. That the pretended cause for the <del>future</del> <add>further</add> continuance

was issued to said J.H. McGraw, Sheriff aforesaid any commitment by
any authority of law or court authorized to issue the same or any mandate

of delievering him therefrom and discharging him from custody.</p>
