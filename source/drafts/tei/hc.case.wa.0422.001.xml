<pb></pb>

<p>In the District Court
of the Third Judicial District
holding terms at Seattle
King County, Wash. Territory.</p>

<p>In the matter of the
application of
Alexander Brown and
George Brown, infants,
by their father Nicholas
Brown for a
Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>
<p>No.
Petition.</p>

<p>To the Hon. R.A. Jones, Judge
of the above entitled Court:</p>

<p>The petition of Alexander Brown
and George Brown, infants, by their
father Nicholas Brown, respectfully
shows:</p>

<p>1.
That Alexander Brown an infant
about 4 years old, and George
Brown an infant about 2 years
old, the children of said Nicholas
Brown are now restrained of
their liberty at a place known
as Samish in Skagit County,
Washington Territory by one

<pb></pb>

Olive Brown the mother of said
infants and the wife of said
Nicholas Brown.</p>

<p>2.
That the alleged cause or pretense
of restraint of said infants
according to the best knowledge
and belief of the petitioner said
Nicholas Brown is that she the
said Olive Brown claims to have
a legal right to the care and
custody of said infant children.</p>

<p>3.
That the said restraint of
said infant children is illegal
in this, to wit:
That the said Olive Brown,
mother of said infants, did, on
the 15th day of May 1887, at the
City of Seattle, Wash T. leave the
house and home of said Nicholas
Brown her husband, without his
consent and without any provocation
or cause whatsoever;
that the said Olive Brown on said
13th day of May 1887, told her said
husband that she would leave

<pb></pb>

his house and home and that
she would not live with him here
after and would henceforth
restrain away from him together
with said infants; that said
Olive Brown on said 15th day of May
1887, left the bed and board of
said Nicholas Brown and took
with her Alexander Brown and
George Brown the infant children
aforesaid without the consent
of her said husband said
Nicholas Brown; that said Olive
Brown took said infant children
with her to the aforesaid place
in Skagit County, and does now
restrain them of their liberty
and refuses to give them to said
Nicholas Brown the father of said
children; that the said Nicholas
Brown is better able to educate
and support the said infants
than their mother said Olive
Brown</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner
pray that a Writ of Habeas
Corpus may be granted, directed
to the said Olive Brown, 
commanding her to have the

<pb></pb>

bodies of said Alexander Brown
and George Brown infants, before
your honor at a time and place
therein to be specified, to do and
receive what shall then and there
be committed by your honor concerning
them, together with
the time and cause and authority
of their detention, and
said writ, and that they may
be restored to their liberty.</p>

<p>Dated May 17th 1887</p>

<p>Alexander Brown
George Brown
and
Nicholas Brown
mark 
their father</p>

<p>In presence of
Louis G. Trummel</p>
