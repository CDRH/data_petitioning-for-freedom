      <p class="tei_p">In the District Court holding terms 
at Seattle -</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In the matter of the application
of Qui a chinaman for a 
writ of habeas corpus-</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On reading and filing
the petition of Qui duly signed and 
verified whereby it appears that said 
Qui is illegally imprisoned and 
restrained of his liberty by John H.
McGraw, Sheriff of King County and 
stating wherein the said illegality 
consists; from which it appears to me
that a writ of habeas corpus ought to 
issue;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is therefore ordered that a writ of 
habeas corpus issue out of and under the
seal of this Court, directed to John H McGraw
commanding him to have the body of the
said Qui (Chinaman) before me in the 
Courtroom of the District Court at Seattle
King County on the 18th day of November 1884
at 12 o'clock M of that day, to be and receive
what shall then and there be ordered concerning the said
Qui, together with the time and cause of his 
detention and that he there and then has this writ</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dated November 14 1884
R.S. Greene
Judge of said Court</p>
