      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioners say that said imprisonment is illegal in this — that your petitioners are sentenced to prison for an indefinite period of time.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioners further say that they nor neither of them have at any time threatened to commit an offense against the person or property of Josiah Gellerson or any other person</p>
