    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Fred S. Walton submitted an application for a writ of habeas corpus against City Marshal John G. Boyle on September 7, 1901, stating that he was arrested, charged, fined, and detained under a North Yakima licensing ordinance for peddling "Quaker medicine" without paying a licensing fee. Walton's petition argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional for two reasons. First, it contained an unreasonable licensing fee that infringed upon his right to engage in business on equal terms with residents of Yakima (the right for people to have "like privileges, rights and immunities in every other state"), which likely referred to the Comity Clause of the Constitution and possibly referred to the 14th Amendment. Second, it violated the right of commerce and the right of citizens of different states to engage in commerce, which was likely referring to the Commerce Clause. Judge Cornelius H. Hanford commanded that Boyle show cause for Walton's detention to the Court; Boyle returned the writ and stated that Walton had violated the peddling statute and was convicted through proper legal processes. Boyle also responded that he had already released Walton on September 7, six hours before he received the writ of habeas corpus. He denied Walton's constitutional challenges and charged that Walton had sufficient money to pay for a license and that he had burdened police by hosting open air concerts as a marketing strategy. Supplemental research reveals that this case was a test case organized by Quakers to test the constitutionality of the peddling ordinance. </li>
