<p>IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT, NINTH CIRCUIT, DISTRICT OF
WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

<p>In re Frank E. Corbin.</p>

<p>B R I E F O F R E S P O N D E N T .</p>

<p>A CONTRACT OF ENLISTMENT IS NOT VOIDABLE BY PARENTS OR GUARD-
IANS IF THE SOLDIER IS HELD PURSUANT TO A SENTENCE OF A COURT-
MARTIAL OR ANY STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN WITH A VIEW TO BRINGING HIM
BEFORE SUCH COURT.</p>

<p>In re Kaufman, 41 Federal Reporter, 876; In re Dohrendorf,
et al., 40 Federal Reporter, 148; In re Cosenow, 37 Federal Re-
porter, 668; In re Dowd, 90 Federal Reporter, 718; Ex parte
Anderson, 16 Iowa.</p>

<p>In the Kaufman case, the father sought the discharge of
his son, who was held by the military authorities and had been
ordered before a military court for trial as a deserter. Quot-
ing from the syllabus:</p>

<p>A minor who enlists in the United States Army upon hs rep=
resentation that he is of age, and receives pay and clothing and
afterwards deserts and is arrested as a deserter, and at the time
of his petition is held by the United States awaiting trial by a 
court-martial for the crime of desertion, will not be released
under a writ of HABEAS CORPUS upon the ground that being a minor
his enlistment was unlawful contrary to the Revised Statutes
of the United States.</p>

<p>In the Cosenow case the minor swore that he was twenty-one
years and seven months old at the time of enlistment. He
deserted, and at the time of the filing of the petition was held
in custody awaiting the action of the reviewing authority on the
proceedigs of the court-martial. His father sought the discharge
of his son on the ground of infancy at the time of enlistment.
The court refused to discharge him, holding that "an enlistment
contrary to law is not void, but voidable;" that the court-mar-
tial had jurisdiction of the offense, and the soldier "must be
remanded to await the result of his trial."</p>

<p>The Dowd case arose on the application of the mother for the
release of her son, who was held under sentence of a summary
of court. The court held, quoting from the syllabus:</p>

<p>The enlistment of a minor in the Army without the consent of
his parents or guardian, required by Revised Statutes, section
1117, is not void, but voidable only, and while he remains in the
service under such enlistment the mino is amendable to the Ar-
ticles of War, and can not be remanded to the custody of his par-
ents by a civil court on a writ of HABEAS CORPUS while undergong
a sentence imposed on him by a court-martial for a violation of
such articles.</p>

<p>In the Anderson cas,e the father procured a writ of HABEAS
CORPUS for the purpose of obtaining the discharge of his minor
son from the military custody in which he was held. It was ad-
mitted by the pleadings that the relator's son was a minor when
he enlisted and that he enlisted without his parents consent.</p>

<p>The Judge's decision was as follows:</p>

<p>I therefore hold that the return of the respondent in this
case, that he holds the prisoner for the crime of desertion, and
that heis now awaiting his trial before a court-martial is suf-
ficient, and that he must abide by the decision of the latter
court, before the question of the validity of his enlistment can be
determined by the civil courts on HABEAS CORPUS.</p>

<p>Section 3 of an act of Congress amending the Articles of 
War and for others purposes, approved July 27, 1892, provides:
"That fraudulent enlistment, and the receipt of anypay or allow-
ance thereunder, is hereby declared a military offense and made
punishiable by court-martial under the Sixty-second Article of
War."</p>

<p>In Circular No. 13 of the War Department for 1892, the Acting
Secretary of War decided that cases of fraudulent enlistment
should be tried before a general court-martial. That circular
declared fraudulent enlistment to be "an enlistment procured by
means of a willful misrepresentation in regard to a qualifica-
tion or disqualification for enlistment, or by an intentional
concealment of a disqualification which has had the effect of
causing the enlistment of a man not qualified to be a soldier,
and who but for such false representation or concealment would
have been rejected.</p>

<p>Section 1117, Revised Statutes, provides that: "No person
under the age of twenty-one years shall be enlisted or mustered
into the military service of the United States without the 
written consent of his parents or guardian; PROVIDED, That such
minor has such parens or guardians entitled to his custody
and control."</p>

<p>A minor who obtains his enlistment into the military ser-
vice of the United States by falsely representing that he is
twenty-one years old is guilty of fraudulent enlistment and is
amendable to trial by a military court-martial which has exclus-
ive jurisdiction in such case.</p>

<p>Should a civil court discharge from the Army a minor who is
under charges and awaiting trial by court-martial for desertion,
fradulent enlistment, or any other offense prescribed by the Ar-
ticles of War or other acts of Congress, it would disregard the
Constitutional power of Congress "To make rules for the Govern-
ment and Regulation of the land and naval forces."</p>

<p>Under the custom of the service the parents or guardian of a 
minor who enlists without their consent can obtain his discharge
upon application to the Secretary of War, prior to the commis-
sion of a military offense. Their right under section 1117,
Revised Statutes are thus sufficiently protected; but when the
minor has committed a military offense the interests of the pub-
lic in the administration of justice are paramount to the right
sequence of his offense before the right to his dischagr be
passed upon. (Digest Opin. J. A. G., SS 1258 and 1204, and notes.)</p>

<p>The soldier should not be allowed to escape punishment for his
offense, even though his parents assert their right to his ser-
vices. A minor in civil life is liable to punishment for a crime
or misdemeanor, even though his confinement nay interfere with
the rights of his parents.</p>
