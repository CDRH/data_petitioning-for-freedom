    <li>Summary of Proceedings: The Davis family petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve Joseph R. Kimmel from the custody of the Kimmel family, which was granted. The petitioners were Annie Davis, Joseph R.'s grandmother, Carrie Davis, his aunt, and Clarence W. Davis, his uncle. Joseph M. Kimmel intended to take the boy back to his mother's and Joseph R.'s grandmother's house in Portland, Oregon. To faciliate this, he had taken the boy from the Davis's home in August of 1913. Joseph's R.'s mother, Jennie Kimmel, had died on July 5, 1913, but she had apparently agreed with her husband before her death that their son would stay with her family. After hearing the evidence, Joseph was remanded to the custody of the Kimmels. The Davises appealed to the state supreme court, which overturned the decision of the lower court. Ultimately, it was found that the child's father, Joseph M. Kimmel, had "voluntarily relinquished" his right to the boy. The court awarded custody of Joseph R. Kimmel to the Davis family but allowed his father to have him on Sundays as well as "four days in any month, with one week's notice."</li>
