In the District court of the Third Judicial District of Washington Territory, holding
terms at Seattle, in King County, said territory.

In the matter of the application of William, a Chinaman, for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.

On reading and filing the petition of William, a Chinaman, duly signed and verified,
whereby it appears that he is illegally imprisoned and restrained of his liberty by
John H. McGraw, sheriff of said King County, and stating wherein the illegality consists;
from which it appears to me that a Writ of Habeas Corpus ought to issue:

It is ordered that a write of Habeas Corpus  issue directed to the said John H. McGraw,
commanding him to have the body of the said William before me in the court room of
the District Court, at Seattle, King County, said territory, on the 20th day of October
1884, at 4 o'clock P.M. of that day, to do and receive what shall then and there be
considered concerning the said William, together with the time and cause of his detention,
and that he have then  and ther the said write; and that in the mean time he be admitted
to bail in the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars.

Dated the 24th day of October 1884.

Roger S. Greene
Judge of said court.
