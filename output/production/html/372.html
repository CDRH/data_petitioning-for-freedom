    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Bound parties Thomas Combs and Charles Ross were arrested for unlawfully collecting and removing garbage without a contract with the City of Omaha in 1901. They were ordered to pay a fine of $5, refused, and were detained; then, Henry Combs filed an application for Habeas Corpus on their behalf. When the case was heard in April of 1901, Judge Dickinson found that they were indeed legally confined as they violated the 4462 Ordinance, yet the first section of the Ordinance is void because it seeks to enforce a civil contract upon the City by the exercise of a criminal ordinance. Therefore, their writ for Habeas Corpus is approved, and while a bill of exceptions is filed the Nebraska Supreme Court affirms the judgment. </li>
