    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Swedish citizen and "alien" Charles W. Nordstrom applied for a writ of habeas corpus against King County Sheriff Edward Cudahee. His application stated that he was being held and would be executed by hanging for the alleged crime of murder, in violation of the Constitution and U.S. law. Nordstrom claimed that a change in the Washington State statutes regulating the death penalty procedure made his execution illegitimate because it would rely on an ex post facto law and would violate his right to due process. Judge Cornelius H. Hanford sent an acerbic letter to Nordstrom's attorney, denying the application and refusing to hold a hearing, claiming that he aimed to end the series of appeals and applications that Nordstrom had previously made. Hanford stated that he had twice refused to grant a writ, and that his refusals had been sustained by the Supreme Court. Nordstrom appealed the denial. Nordstrom remained in custody, and a newspaper source reveals that he was later executed. </li>
