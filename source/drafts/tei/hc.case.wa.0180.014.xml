A Yes</p>
<p>Q How long did Young and Sugiura stay there? A About half an hour.</p>
<p>Q What did they have to say? A they told me that Washio had agreed
with them thay they should be paid for bringing the girl down and
thay they had found Washio hadno money and they wanted mr to
raise the money and give it to them.</p>
<p>Q Did they say how much money they were to get? A They said
Washio had agreed to give them $800., I told them I didn't agree to
give them the money and it was up to them to get it from Washio.</p>
<p>Q What wlse did Young, Sugiura or Washio say at that time? A Young
and Sugiura said the agreement with Washio was to pay them $800. for
bringing the girl down here but that things didn't go just right so
they were willing to settle and take $400. and wanted me to pay them that. Sugiura said he had posed as an interpreter and that
Young has possed as an Immigration officer and the woman believeing
them $800. to take the chances of bringing this woman here to a house
of prostitution and that they wanted their money. They told me later
that they had been to see Mr. Gardner of the Immigration offices and
had fixed things with him so there would be no trouble but that we
must come through with the money to them. Young and Sugiura went to
the Imperial hotel, Washio and Hana stayed in my house. The next day
I think it was, Umeda and I were sent for by Young and Sugiura and
went to the Imperial Hotel to see them, Young and Sugiura and
their agreement with Washio and said they couldn't wait for their
money and must get back to Seattle and that Umeda and I must raise the
money for them. Later in the day Young and Sugiura came to my house 
Umeda was present also, and there I paid them $200. and later I paid
them $50. more.</p>
<p>Who did you pay this money to? A I handed it to Umeda who passed
it over on the table, Sugiura picked it up and handed it to Young.</p>
<p>Q Did you see Young and Sugiura after that? A They came the next
day and said it was alright for Hana to practice prostitution as they
had fixed it with the immigration officers, they had told us at first
not to let her do business for a while as they were afraid if we did
there would be trouble for all of us, that was the last I saw of them.</p>
<fw>13</fw>
<pb/>
<p>Q After that Hana practiced prostitution in that house didn't she?
A Yes</p>
<p>Q You after wrote a letter to Sugiura didn't you? A yes</p>
<p>Q Is this the letter? (showing letter) A Yes</p>
<p>Q What do you mean when you say in that letter "what did you tell the
Immigration officers about Hana"? A They had told me that they had
fixed things in regard to Hana doing business and the Japanese News
Paper had printed an article and I wanted to know how he had fixed
things and what he has told them when he fixed it, after the News
Paper article Nakada phoned me to come to his office, I went there
and he told me that the Immigration officers would be after Hana that
night or the next morning and told me to get her out of the house,
Umeda was there with me, and we got the woman out of the house,
took her to a lodging-house on Keaney St., near the City Hall, the
house from which she was arrested. The next day Nakada came and told
me that the United States Marshal was after myself and Umeda and that
we had better hide out, he said "I can fix it if you will come through"
I asked him to fix it and he told me to give him $50. and he would
fix it <del><unclear/></del> so I would be out of California as far as the
officers knew. I paid him two $20. and one $10. in gold, then he
told me, this $50. you give me is not all for me, I have to buy
cigars for the Marshals and give them a piece of it beside.</p>
<p>Q Was there anyone present when you gave him that money? A No, I 
showed the money to Umeda and told him what I was going to do with
it, I forgot to tell you that when we were at the Burns Agency Nakada
told us he could get a United States warrant for Hana for $250. The
next day after I gave Namasa the $50. Nakada and a Marshal came to
my house after Hana, Nakada said the Marshal wants Hana and if you
don't produce her he will hold you until she is produced. I told him
I couldn't stand for that and Nakada asked me where she was, I told
him "I hid her on your instructions, you told me to hide her", finally
Umeda took the Marshal to the room and showd him Hana. After my
wife was taken to Seattle Nakada told me he would find out about the
Seattle case and wanted me to pay him $25. I paid him $15.</p>
<p>I certify the foregoing is a true and full transcript of the
atenographic notes made by me at the time statement was ade.</p>
