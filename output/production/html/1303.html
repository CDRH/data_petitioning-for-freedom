    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On February 8, 1886, L.T. Savacool allegedly forged a property deed. Ten days later, C.A. McCabe and James Robinson formally accused him of this, and he was brought before Garfield County justice of the peace William Newland. Newland found him guilty and set bail at $1,000. As he could not pay this, Savacool was confined to the Columbia County Jail in Dayton, Washington Territory. That same day, on February 18, 1886, Savacool petitioned for a writ of habeus corpus against Columbia county sheriff J.H. Hosler, saying that he was unlawfully detained. He claimed that the writ of commitment that Newland had signed did not allow Hosler to lawfully imprison him and that forgery was not a crime in the ordinances of Washington Territory. He subpoenaed many witnesses to speak in his defense, including his wife, Florence Savacool. For his part, Hosler cited an order made in 1884 by Columbia County District Court judge S.C. Wingard stating that everyone awating trial in Columbia County District Court should be held in the Columbia County Jail. The hearing took place on February 23, 1886. Judge William G. Langford found that there was not probable cause to find Savacool guilty of forgery and ordered him released, with the county paying all court costs.</li>
