Said acts were discovered by plaintiff on or about October 16, 1886, when action for divorce was at once instituted. The case was brought on to be heard in the District Court to-day, and the allegations of the plaintiff having been sustained, the Court ordered that a decree of divorce be entered, and that the care of the three children&#8212;Etta E., 12 years of age, Frank M., 8 years of age, and Warren H., 4 years of age&#8212;be given to Mrs. Stetson, and that the defendant pay quarterly to Mrs. Stetson for the support of the children $20 per month, each, until said children have become of age, or in case death, when the payments shall cease.
