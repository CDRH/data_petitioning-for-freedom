        "Case Summary": "By his next friend William Clark, Anson accused Henry Mitchel and Henry Russel of assaulting him with the intention of reducing him to slavery. The judge elected to issue a writ of habeas corpus. Mitchel and Russel were then arrested on kidnapping charges and Anson was jailed while awaiting his hearing. Mitchel and Russel pleaded not guilty, and Anson was ordered to be hired out while his status was being considered.\n\nSee hc.case.mo.0019 and hc.case.mo.0020.",

        "Encoding Notes": "<airtable:mention id=\"menE9omj8ZKjM9DZ4\">@Cory Young</airtable:mention>\u00a0can you look at this case? the Henrys don't actually have Anson, though they are named as defendants; for that reason, I'm not sure they should be labeled as the holding parties; it turns out Hammand is the one with Anson in his custody, as he bought Anson from the Henrys...I'm wondering if Hammand is the holding party and the Henrys are kidnappers as case role; do you think this would correspond to other freedom suits?\n\n<airtable:mention id=\"menZImXcrAYDydFL5\">@Katrina Jagodinsky</airtable:mention>\u00a0I would agree that Hammond is the holding party and that Mitchell and Russell are kidnappers in this case. But I don't believe it's because Hammond purchased Anson; I'm fairly sure he was the deputy sheriff acting as jailer. Hammond appears as the holding party in a few other of the Missouri cases. Plus, there's this incredibly problematic law enforcement webpage claiming he was killed in 1836 (https://www.odmp.org/officer/5990-deputy-sheriff-george-hammond). \n\nAs for other freedom suits, I think we should distinguish between freedom suits, fugitive slave suits, and kidnapping suits. In kidnapping suits, the holding party is often going to be the kidnappers, although this suit shows that kidnappers occasionally deposited the people they seized with third parties. In freedom suits that don't involve kidnappers, the holding party is most likely going to be the enslaver. Is this helpful?\n\nP.S. It occurs to me that we don't actually have the habeas petition for this case. We have the petition for a writ of trespass/assault/false imprisonment, and we have the writ of habeas corpus, but we don't have the petition for the writ of habeas corpus. Should we assume that William Clark supplied that petition, too?\n\n<airtable:mention id=\"menHEbipq3ZBSbExy\">@Cory Young</airtable:mention>\u00a0this reading makes more sense to me; let's label Hammond as the holding party and jailer, while we label the Henrys as the kidnappers. I'm not ready to make a general rule, since I think many of these petitions will be idiosyncratic.\n\nThere's actually no habeas *petition*, here. Anson's next friend, William Clark, did not ask for the writ, but rather for five hundred dollars on a bill of trespass and assault. The judge appears to have issued a writ of habeas corpus of his own accord in order to proceed with the fact finding.",
