    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Frederick Jacobsen filed a petition of for a writ of Habeas Corpus on December 29th, 1919, in hope of gaining custody of his daughter, Helen Jacobsen. Helen was, at the time, in the custody of her mother, Florence Jacobsen, and her maternal grandparents, Roy T. and May Earley. Florence Jacobsen had been living in her parents home since she and Frederick Jacobsen divorced. Frederick Jacobsen's petition was specifically against the Earley's, claiming that they were keeping his daughter away from him, even refusing visits. The Judge called for the pair of grandparents to produce young Helen in court to determine whether or not F. Jacobsen's writ would be allowed. The respondents argued that their daughter, Florence Jacobsen, had taken care of and been the sole provider for Helen Jacobsen since her birth, and that the father did not deserve custody. According to the Douglas County Court appearance docket, F. Jacobsen's writ was dismissed on January 6th, 1920, and Helen remained in her mother's and grandparents' custody. </li>
