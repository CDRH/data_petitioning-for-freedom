In the District Court holding terms at Seattle in King County, Washington Territory

In the matter of the application of Ah Foong for a Writ of Habeas Corpus } Order for
writ

On reading and filing the petition of Ah Foong, duly signed and verified by him, whereby
it appears that he is illegally imprisoned and restrained of his liberty by William
Murphy, acting Chief of Police of the City of Seattle at Seattle in King County, Washington
Territory and stating wherein the illegality consists, from which it appears to me
that a writ of habeas corpus ought to issue. It is ordered that a Writ of habeas corpus
issue out of and under the seal of the above entitled Court directed to the said William
Murphy commanding him to have the body of the said Ah Foong before me in the Courtroom
of the said Court on the twe 19th day of January 1885 at two oclock P.M. of that day
to receive what shall then and there be considered concerning the said Ah Foong, together
with the time and cause of his detention and that he have then and there the said
writ
