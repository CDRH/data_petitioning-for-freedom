      <p class="tei_p">I was one of the 
Jury sworn to here the inquest
on the body of Jas Finch
I heard the testimony of Ruby 
Stanley, she claimed to be
An eye witness of the transaction
<del>witness</del> 
         <span class="tei_add">I have</span> 
         <del>asked to</del> read 
Ruby Stanleys testimony shown 
<span class="tei_add">&amp; testified to</span> by Dr Penfield, that is about the 
substance as near as I can 
remember from beginning to end
this is virtualy the substance 
I remember nothing more seems 
a little abreviated Mr Griffitts
appeard before the Coroners Jury
and cross examined most
of the witnesses but not to any 
great extent</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Cross</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I dont know what terms 
you would put on it I suppose 
that you simply asked him to 
ask a few questions think you 
asked this witness questions</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I will swear that this is 
the substance of her testimony 
there might have been trivial exceptions
I could detect without the aid
of this paper the substance of her 
testimony being formen of the 
Jury I paid particular attention
to it</p>
