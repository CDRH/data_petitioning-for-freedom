<p>Albert Wiley
v
Kiskick
Kingman</p>

<p>The first error alleged occurred in selecting a jury. The person was challenged for cause on the ground that he had once already errored on a <unclear>jury</unclear> on a talesman in the treat of a cause at the same team of the conet, the court overrated the challenge, This was error. Code sec 270, It appears that after the person had served as a talesman he had ben called to seen as a regular juror for te term in place of a juror excused. This made no difference, the law remained the same, the challenge should have been allowed, the beneficent objects of the section could not to frees hated by placing a man on the regular paned who could not serve on a penny if challenged. The object of the law is to get rid of professional jurors, a most pertiferous set as every lawyer knows, and this could not be done away with by a sheriff or court, by <del>mutting could</del> putting such a jurer on the regular <unclear></unclear>.

<p>The plaintiff in error claims that by the insturction the court total the jury that Wiley did do some <del>illegal</del> act to Kiskick and that such act was illegal and that the letter of <unclear>communition</unclear> mint did not justify such illegal act. It is apparent from the neend that the court did do just what it is claimed that is did. The indication of the court is two plain not to have been understood by the jury. Did the pleadings need evidence authorize such an instruction. The jury are only to pass upon the issues made up in the case. They pass upon the controverted facts, that is the facts controverted vy the proceedings. In this case the petition alleged an assault and battery and false imprisonment. The answer set up two grounds of defense
