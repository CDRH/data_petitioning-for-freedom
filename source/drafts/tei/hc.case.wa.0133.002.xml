<p>
<del>If you filed that the defendant
was killing</del>
</p>

<p>
There is some conflict between
the evidence fallen peneatium
and that in the defense as to
whether there was such a state
or facts at the time the fatal
shot was fired as would justify
the defendant in firing it in
self defense. You must
weight the evidence in the
purpose of determining which
state of facts is established
as in other cases <add> you may</add> look at the
witnesses, look at their situation
as everything them to
<del>see</del> see and from the facts,
look at their manner in testifying upon the witness
stand consider their reclaims
to this case and the interest
or want of interest that they
</p>

<pb/>
<p>
may have in request <add>and</add> consider
whether they have wed
a <unclear></unclear> and probable
story. There and other <del><unclear>considerations</unclear></del> facts
are in all comes peoples
and neinant considerations
to be unsigned <add>upon</add> and weighed by
jurices, to determine what
the facts are that are established
I have charged you that the
<unclear>sue of</unclear>establishing self
defense was upon the Defendant.
He used not establish this
defense however as strangely as
he warned he required to establish
a fact <unclear></unclear> for him to
establish in a <unclear>cime</unclear> case.
In the latter case he would be
required to establish the fact
by a preponderance of evidence.
In this case it is only meaning
from him to break down the
case of the Territory to such
an extent as to raise a
reasonable doubt as to<unclear></unclear>
The killing was unlawful
or justifiable.
</p>
<p>I have already charged you
that, the danger that will
justify a killing in seld defense
need not be real, if in he
such as would appear to be
real, to a reasonable man.</p>

<pb/>

<p>Upon the other hand, another of
the circumstances were such
that the danger was in <unclear></unclear>
<add>afrom in</add> real, yet of the defendant
did not know it, and
denied to a killing with a deadly
weapon without knowing or
believing it was real, the killing
could not be in self defense,
the defendant killed Amos
Light Beardon, <unclear>same is no coding</unclear>
 to show that. Amos Light Beardon
was <add>himself</add> assaulting the defendant
in a manner that would endanger
life or limb, of use defendant
therefore at the time the fatal
shot was fired suppored he had
my to deal with and assault
by the deceased, and knew
nothing of an assault or a
meditated assault by the
other brothers in did of the 
assault by the deceased,
Then the act of killing was not
in self defense.</p>

<p>
If however you believe that
the deceased was being assaulted
by all these of the Beardon
and him at the same time,
and that the defendant had
defined the affront as for as
neemed, or that the attack
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
upon him was no bruise that
he could not defend by retreat
from it, and an find that
the attack was of such acharacter
as to lead a reasonable
man in the same situation
to believe that he was in danger
of great bodily harm, Then
the defendant was justified
in killing any of <unclear>with brother</unclear>
in self defense, But this
indention is limited by what
I have heretofore tried to you,
naucaeses <del>if the defendant
determined to <unclear></unclear>
taken by him from Frank
Beardon at all <unclear></unclear></del>
That the primer must not
have created the necessarily
for the purpose of expelling
him to take life.
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of determining
whether or not the premier
acted in self defence, if
in individual what injuries
were inflicted upon him
by the deceased or his brothers
upon the <unclear></unclear> or the fatal
shot if such injuries were
in retaliation for the <del>firing</del>
firing of the shot. But you
may consider such acts of
the deceased and his brothers
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
for the <unclear>purpose</unclear> of determining
the danger in which the
<add>prisoner</add> stood, if you believe they were
the <add><unclear>carrying out</unclear></add> <del></del> of hostile
demonstrations made by said persons
agaisnt the deceased before
the firing of the shot <add>and</add> to which
<add>demonstrations</add> would reasonably lead <del></del><add>the prisoner</add> to
believe that, he would <unclear>issue</unclear>
<del><unclear></unclear></del> injuries or the
character that he did receive.
If you find that the defendant
acted in self defense
Then that is the end of this
case and you should return
a verdict of not guilty.
If you tried that he did
not act in self defense,
Then the only other thing
for you to is to determine
whether the defendant is
guilty of the full offense
as charged in the statement
or whether he is
guilty only of manslaughter
<del>because of</del> of the <del>act</del> killing
was unlawful and <unclear></unclear>
<del>Then the</del> and the defense <unclear></unclear>
have by the prisoner
preposes that the killing
was <unclear>unlawful</unclear>, Then the
prisoner is guilty <del>of</del> either
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
of murder in the second degree
or of manslaughter.
The statutes defining these
offenses are as follows:
(Here read statute)
</p>
<p>
In order to find that the killing
in this case reaches the grade
of murder in the first
degree, you must find that
the killing was done
purposely, that is intentionallym abd
that it was done maliciously.
In order to determine whether the act was done purposefully and
