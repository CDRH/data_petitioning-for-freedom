    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Peters was imprisoned by W. G. Malin after it was discovered that he had secretly aided mothers of the Sac and Fox Tribe in taking their children from the American Indian Boarding School at Toledo back to the tribe's reservation. There was a previous trial in this same case which determined that Peters had been wrongfully imprisoned. The judge ruled that Malin's court appointed guardianship of the children whom Peters had taken from the school was not legal, and therefore void. The judge also ruled that the state did not have the right to interfere in the proceedings of the school, because it was a federal institution and its attendees federal wards. Furthermore, the criminal laws of the state did not apply to the Native Americans and their tribes, and would only apply if a member of the tribe was involved in an act which "brought him within the plane of the legislative jurisdiction of the state." It was argued that this would apply only in a small number of cases. The ruling of this retrial is unknown.</li>
