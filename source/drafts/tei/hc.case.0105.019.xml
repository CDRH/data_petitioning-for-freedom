<p>Before Daniel Collins, Coroner.</p>

<p>In the matter of the inquisition upon the body 
of Scameoch alias John (an Indian) deceased.}</p>

<p>We, the undersigned, the jurors summoned to appear 
before Daniel Collins, the Coroner of the County of Pierce, 
Territory of Washington, at Elk plains in the County of 
Pierce, where the body was examined, and adjourned to 
Steilacoom, on the twenty first (21st) day of August, 
1861, to inquire into the cause of death of Scameoch alias John 
having been duly sworn according to law, and having 
made such inquisition after inspecting the body, and hearing 
the testimony adduced, upon our oaths, each and all do say, 
that we find the deceased was named Scameoch alias John 
(an Indian) that he came to his death on the 21st day of 
August, 1861, in this country, from mortal wounds received 
with a knife in the hands of James Riley at Bradley's 
barn in this county on the 18th day of August 1861. 
And we further find that we believe that James Riley 
was the person by whose act the death of said Indian 
Scameoch, alias John was occasioned. As we have 
evidence that the said Riley was with the Indian, when he received 
the wound, and was the only white man with him during the 
<unclear>affiar</unclear>, and was seen in pursuit of him when he received 
the wounds, further that he confessed the same.</p>

<p>All of which we duly certify by this inquisition in writing 
by <del>the</del> us signed this twenty third (23d) day of August, 
1861.</p>
