<p>*****</p> 
<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION 
OF CELIA BERG O'NEILL, alias
CELIA BERG, for a
WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS. ))</p> 
<p>No. 2963 
PETITION FOR WRIT OF 
HABEAS CORPUS.</p>  
<p>To the Honorable The Judge of the above entitled 
Court:</p> 
<p>Comes now Celia Berg O'Neill, the petitioner 
above named, by her attorneys, Messrs.Gill, Hoyt &amp; Frye,
and represents and shows to Your Honors as follows;- </p> 
<p>I.</p>
<p>That she is a citizen of the United States of
America, over the age of twenty-one years, a resident and
citizen of the State of Washington and the district and
division of the above entitled court above specified; that
she is a native of the Russian Emire and came to the
United States of America in the year 1904 where she has
since resided.</p> 
<p>II.</p> 
<p>That your petitioner intermarried with Fred O'Neill
in the city of Tacoma, State of Washington, on the 20th day
of November,1914, and that at all times thereafter has been
and still is the lawful wife of said Fred O'Neill; that at
the time of said marriage of your petitioner and said Fred
O'Neill in said City of Tacoma, State of Washington,
in the United States of America, the said Fred O'Neill was
a natural 
<pb></pb> 
born citizen of the United States of America, having been
born in the State of Mississippi of the United States of
America in the year 1887, and that he has never renounced
his allegiance to the United States of America acquired by
such birth.</p> 
<p>III.</p> 
<p>That on or about the 14th day of October, 1914, your
petitioner was taken into custody at Skagway, Alaska, by
one Albert H.Joy, Immigrant Inspector of the United States
upon a warrant issued by J.B.Densmore, Acting Secretary of
Labor of the United States, charging your petitioner with
being an alien in the United States of America and with being
a prostitute, and that she was such at the time of her entry
into the United States and that she entered the United States
for the purpose of prostitution. That thereafter a hearing was
had before the said Albert H.Joy on the 15th day of October,
1914, and said cause was transferred for further hearing to
Seattle, Washington, where a hearing upon such charge was had
before Thos.W.Lynch, Examining Inspector, and thereafter your 
petitioner was taken into custody and is now in the custody of
Henry M.White, Commissioner of Immigration, under and by virtue
of a warrant issued by the Secretary of the Department of
Labor of the United States of America directing that your
petitioner be deported from the United States of America and
transported to the Empire of Russia for the reason as stated
in said warrant, that your petitioner is an alien in the
United States and has been found practicing prostitution in
the United States of America</p>
<pb></pb>
<p>IV.</p> 
<p>Your petitioner further avers that she is restrained
of her liberty by the said Henry M. White, as such Commissioner
of Immigration, under a claim that she is subject to deporta-
tion for a violation of the laws of the United States in that
being an alien she was found practicing prostitution in the
United States of America.</p> 
<p>V.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further avers that she is held in
custody under and by virtue of a claim that she has violated
the laws of the United States of America, and is being held
in such custody within the dirstict and division aforesaid.</p> 
<p>VI.</p> 
<p>Your petitioner further avers that she is unable to
attach hereto a copy of the process under which she is held
in custody and restrained of her liberty for the reason that
she has no copy in her possession, and for the reason that she
has not been furnished with such copy.</p> 
<p>VII.</p> 
<p>Your petitioner, however, avers that she is being now
restrained of her liberty and held in the custody of Henry M.
White, Commission of Immigration, under a pretense of a law
of the United States of America.</p> 
<p>VII.</p> 
<p>Your petitioner further avers that at the said hearing
before the said Thomas W. Lynch, Examining Inspector, it
appeared conclusively and without contradiction that your
petitioner at all times since her marriage with the said
Fred O'Neill has been a resident of the United States of
America and a citizen thereof, and that the said warrant of
the secretary of labor is invalid and of no force and effect
in law for the reason that your petitioner is not an alien.</p> 
<pb></pb>
<p>IX.</p> 
<p>Your petitioner now complains that she is unlawfully
restrained of her liberty by the said Henry M. White under the
pretense that she has violated a law of the United States of
America, which pretense and claim is unfounded in fact and is
to the said Henry M. White and to the Secretary of Labor of
the United States well known.</p> 
<p>X.</p> 
<p>Your petitioner further avers that in her confinement 
by the said Henry M. White her rights as an American citizen 
are infringed and she is deprived of her liberty without any
warrant of law and that such restraint is illegal and invalid.</p> 
<p>XI.</p> 
<p>Your petitioner further avers that in the hearing before
the officers of the Immigration Service of the United States,
she was denied the right to cross examine witnesses, to meet
the witnesses face to face, and that your petitioner in such
hearing before the officers of the Immigration Service of
the United States was denied a fair and impartial hearing, and
that there was no testimony taken before the said Albert H.Joy
or Thos. W. Lynch tending to show or which did show, that your
petitioner was at any time subsequent to her said intermarriage
with said Fred O'Neill an alien to the United States of America.</p> 
<p>WHEREFORE your petitioner prays that she may be allowed
the Writ of right, a Writ of Habeas Corpus to the Honorable
Henry M.White, Commissioner of Immigration directing, command-
ing, and requiring the said Henry M.White to produce before
your Honors at a time and place to be specified the body of
<pb></pb> 
your petitioner, together with the cause allnged for her
detention by the said Henry M.White, and that, she further be
awarded a Writ of Certiorari to The Honorable Henry M.White,
Commissioner of Immigration, commanding and requiring the said
Commissioner to certify unto this court all and singular the
proceedings had before said Albert H.Joy and Thos.W.Lynch,
as such Immigration Inspectors, respecting the matter of the
deportation of your petitioner, and that upon the return to
such writ of Habeas Corpus and the return to such Writ of 
Certiorari such order be made therein by Your Honors as upon
due consideration is consonant with law under and pursuant to
the Constitution of the United States of America and as in
duty bound your petitioner will ever pray.</p>
