<add>Jefferson County W.T.</add> by
John F. Sheehan Sheriff of Jefferson County
W.T. and H.G. Thornton a constable of King
County Washington Territory.</p>

<p>That the cause and pretense of
the restraint by said Sheehan is a telegram
from the Chief of Police to him directing
him to arrest said petitioner because he
was indebted to P. Grubb and O. Johnson
saloon keepers in the City of Seattle.</p>

the restraint by said Thornton is that
he holds a warrant as Constable of
King County directing him to arrest said
petitioner in King County and not elsewhere
on said warrant to answer an alleged</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>debt claimed to be owing from the petitoner
to said P. Grubb and O Johnson.</p>

<p>What said restraint is illegal</p>

<p>Because said warrant held by Thornton does
not authorize the arrest of petitioner in Jefferson
County.</p>

<p>What said Justice had not authorization to
issue said warrant because no bond was
given as required by law and no proof was
made before said Justice as required by law</p>

<p>Wherefore,
Your petitioner prays that a Writ of Habeas
Corpus may be granted, directed to said
John F. Sheehan Sheriff, as aforesaid and
said H.G. Thornton Constable as aforesaid,
commanding them to have the body of said
Charles Lind before your Honor at a time
and place therein to be specified, to do and
receive what shall then and there be considered
by your Honor, concerning said Charles
Lind, together with the time and cause
of his detention and said writ, and that
the said <del>writ</del> Charles Lind, may be
restored to his liberty.</p>

County of Jefferson
Charles Lind being duly sworn, says that he is
the Petitioner in the above entitled action, that</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>he has heard read the foregoing petition and
knows the contents thereof, and that the same
is true of his own knowledge</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to
before me this 24th day } Charles Lind
of August 1885</p>
