    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 23, 1919, Ruth Mathews was arrested at her home, and on August 25, 1919, Mathews was convicted of being a vagrant and a prostitute and sentenced to 30 days in the Douglas County jail. On this same day, Omaha police magistrate Charles Foster signed a mittimus committing Mathews for an examination of venereal disease at the County Jail, and she was sent to a Detention Home for women as authorized by Omaha City Ordinance No. 10222. Mathews alleged that she offered bond, but Foster refused to accept it due to the mittimus that placed her in the custody of the Detention Home. 2 days later, Ruth Mathews filed a petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, stating that she was not and has never been afflicted with a venereal disease, and there is no well-founded suspicion that she is afflicted. On August 29th, Mathews was released on recognizance in the sum of $500.</li>
