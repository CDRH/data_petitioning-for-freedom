<p>In the United States District Court, in and for the Western
District of Washington, Northern Division.</p>
<p>In The Matter of the Aplication 
of Ching Hing, for a
Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>No. <del>2875</del><add>2857</add>
Petitioner's bond pending
decision upon said
application.</p>

<p>Know all men by these presents, that we, Ching
Hing, as principal, and the National Surety Company, a corporation,
as Sureties, are held and firmly bound unto the United States 
of America, in the penal sum of Fifteen Hundred (1500) Dollars
for the payment whereof, well and truly to be made in good and
lawful money of the United States of America, we do bind ourselves,
and each of our heirs, executors, administrators and 
assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.</p>
<p>Sealed with our seals and dated this 2nd day of 
March, 1915.</p>
<p>The condition of the above obligation is such that
where heretofore, the above named principal, Ching Hing, duly
filed his petition for the allowance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus,
and thereupon such Writ issued to Henry M. White, United States
Commissioner of Immigration, and the United States Chinese
Inspector, Henty Monroe, directed, and thereupon the said Henry
M. White, made full return to said petition and upon hearing
of said petition on October 16, 1914, a motion was made for
continuance for the reason that it was necessary for the petitioner
to have certain Interrogatories answered in the City of
Washington, D.C., by Lewis F. Post, assistant Secretary of the
Department of Labor, and Corry M. Stadden, an attourney of Washington,
D.C., and whereupon his Hon. Judge Neterer, one of the 
judges in the above entitled Court, granted thesaid continuance
until such time as such interrogatories were answered, and issued
a commission to Thomas G. Lewis, an attorney and notary public
<pb/>

at Washington, D.C., to take the deposition and testimony of 
said witnesses, and whereupon the said Lewis F. Post, Assistant
Secretary of the Department of Labor, has refused to answer certain
interrogatories propounded by said petitioner through his attorney,
making it necessary for the said petitioner through his attorney 
to make application in the United States District Court, in the 
District of Columbia, to compell Lewis F. Post to answer certain
interrogatories of this matter and in relation thereto, and that
this motion is still pending and further that the hearing upon
this petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, can not be heard until
the determination of this matter now pending in the District 
Court of Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, if the said Ching Hing shall appear,
answer to and abide any Judgment or Order made in said matter,
by the United States District Court in and for the Western
District of Washington, Northern Division, and shall render
himself up in obedience to any Judgement or Order of said District
Court, in and for the Western District of Washington, in said 
matter, then this obligation to be null and void, otherwise to
be and remain of full force and virtue.</p>

<p>In witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands
and seals the day and year first above written.</p>

<p>Ching Hing 
By His Atty John J. Sullivan
National Surety Company</p>
<p>By George W. Allen
Attorney in Fact</p>

<p>Signed, sealed, and delivered in the presence of
John J. Sullivan</p>

US Dist Judge</add></p>
