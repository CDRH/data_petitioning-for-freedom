DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION</p>

      <p class="tei_p">IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION OF 
GENEVIEVE WILDS FOR A WRIT OF 
HABEAS CORPUS} 3895 PETITION. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">The undersigned petitioner, Genevive Wilds, of Seattle, 
King County, Washington, respectfully shows to this Honorable 
Court that she is imprisoned and restrained of her liberty by J.S.
McBride, City Health Officer of the City of Seattle, and is confined 
and imprisoned in the County-City Building in Seattle, against 
her will and protests; that she has not been committed or detained
by virtue of any process of any final judgemnt or decree of any 
competent Tribunal, Court or Judge of Civil or Criminal jursdiction
or by virtue of any execution, warrant, writ or process of any kind
whatsoever; that the cause or pretense of her restraint and imprisonment, 
according to the best knowledge and belief of petitioner
is an order issued by said J.S. McBride Health Officer of the City 
of Seattle, directing that petitioner be held in restraint and 
confinement for a period of from one to three months in order that 
she might receive treatment for a disease which said J.S. McBride 
alleges and pretends that petitioner is afflicted with; that as a 
matter of fact, the petitioner is not afflicted with any disease 
whatsoever, and no reason for holding the petitioner for said
treatment exists. That peitioner has not been exposed to any 
contageous or dangerous or infectious disease and there is no 
danger of petitioner communicating any disease of any kind to the 
public or to any persons whith whom she may come in contact.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That said J.S. McBride pretends to have power and 
authority to hold and imprison petitioner as above set forth under 
and by virtue of Ordinance No. 37928, passed by the City Council

of the City of Seattle in the month of November, 1917; that as a 
matter of fact, said Ordinance is invalid because the provisions
thereof are contrary to the constitution of the United States 
and constitution and laws of the State of Washington, and because 
no valid cause or reason exists, so far as petitioner is concerned, 
for exercising any power such as are pretended to be conferred by 
said Ordinance.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That petitioner is not permitted to receive visitors 
or to use the telephone, or talk with her friends or her family 
except that between the hours of 2 and 4 each day visitors are 
permitted to talk to petitioner through a wire netting for five 
minutes at a time; that petitioner is not being properly cared
for and does not recive proper food, nor considerate or proper
treatment; that petitioner is forced to come in contact with persons 
of vicious character and morals, afflicted with various
infectious diseases, dangerous to the health of petitioner; that 
the imprisonment and restraint of petitioner are illegal and contrary 
to the provisions of the constitution of the United States 
and petitioner has no adequate remedy, except through a Writ of 
Habeas Corpus.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">WHEREFORE, your petitioner prays that a writ of habeas 
corpus may issue directed to the said J.S. McBride, commanding 
him that he have the body of said petitioner, by him imprisoned
and detained, together with a full report and return, setting forth 
the time, cause and authority of such imprisonment and detention, 
before this Honorable court, and that this petitioner be permitted to 
then and there offer evidence and testimony in regard to the facts 
in relation to the detention and imprisonment of petitioner, and 
that this court then and there enter such judgment or order as shall 
be just and equitable under the laws and statutes of the United 
States and the State of Washington</p>
