    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Petitioner G. D. Huie, who was a business partner of Lawrence Bock, stated that Bock was arrested without warrant or authority. Huie applied to Steven Maloney, Chief of Detectives in Omaha, for permission to see Lawrence Bock and have a bail bond fixed for his release until trial but the Chief refused to allow him to see Bock and refused to fix a bail bond. Huie submitted this petition on behalf of Bock as the Chief Detective would not allow the petitioner or their attorney to visit Bock. Petitioner asserted that Bock was not committing a crime or offense at the time of his arrest. Chief Maloney was detaining Bock under the name &#x201C;Lawrence Brock&#x201D; so there is no official record of the detainment of Bock. Judge James P. English ordered that the writ be allowed, returnable on 24 September 1914. Between the hours of 4 and 5 P.M. on 23 September 1914, authorities turned Lawrence Bock over to Deputy United States Marshall Hayes. The writ was served between the hours of 6 and 7 P.M on the same day. </li>
