It had been alleged that the petitioners committed an assault with intent to wound (stabbing) two individuals (referenced as Jordon and Miller). The case file indicates that the two were granted a preliminary hearing and were bound to appear before the District Court. But, as the petition details, there are no actual records of this trial happening. There is no documentation of the two appearing in court, entering pleas, or being sentenced by a trial court. \nThe two were originally brought to court on this charge along with a charge for assault with intent to rob in June 1898. When those charges were brought to court, the Jury found the defendants not guilty. They have been confined in the county jail since that arrest despite the conclusion of the Jury. This petition asserts that the charge at hand (assault with intent to wound) was included in the questions assigned to the Jury in June. The Jury also found the petitioners not guilty on a general question of assault and battery. \nOn 26 November 1898, Police Judge Gordon issued two separate orders to Sheriff McDonald to secure McGregor and Scott into the County Jail and keep them until they are \u201cdischarged by due course of law.\u201d He notes that they are being held for trial in the District Court for the crime of stabbing with intent to wound on 25 June 1898. Each of their bails were set for $700.00, they were to remain in jail unless bail was posted. The petition submitted on behalf of Scott and McGregor states that the petitioners were last \u201carrested\u201d around a month ago, which lines up with the date that Police Judge Gordon ordered that McDonald and Scott be held in jail until their trial before the District Court. \nOn 16 December 1898, Judge Scott (District Court) ordered that the writ be allowed. Sheriff McDonald and Deputy Sheriff Stryker responded that the parties were being held for trial before the District Court, as ordered by Police Judge Gordon. Judge Scott heard the case on 19 December 1898 and decided that the parties would be remanded to custody, at the cost of the petitioners. \n",

The 1920 U.S. federal census indicates that William was a widower and that Paul was Anna's great-nephew (presumably, Anna was the aunt of William's late wife and Paul's late mother). After hearing the evidence, the district court awarded custody of Paul to his father. Anna successfully appealed the case to the state supreme court, which overturned the ruling of the district court and returned Paul to the custody of his great-aunt.",

Smith was detained and imprisoned by Justice of the Peace of Slaughter County, James Hart, for the crime of larceny. Smith was sentenced to one year in county jail by Hart, which Smith and his attorney, Richard Osborn, challenged through petitioning for a writ of Habeas Corpus on February 8, 1889. Smith and Osborn stated that the imprisonment of Smith was illegal and unjust as a justice of the peace may only imprison someone if they fail to furnish bonds or as payment of fine or costs. The next day, Judge Thomas Burke ordered the release of Smith.  ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Frank McCartney was being detained at the Nebraska State Hospital for the Insane. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted. After hearing the evidence, the writ was allowed and McCartney released from custody. The hospital superintendent appealed to the state supreme court, which overturned the decision of the lower court. Consequently, the writ was denied and McCartney remanded to the custody of the hospital superintendent.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Margaret Roy, a subject of Scotland, and her attorney, Ralph S. Pierce, filed the petition to challenge her detainment for the purpose of deportation by the United States immigration office for \"being an alien and believed to advocate the overthrow of government, [and who] disbelieved in and who opposed organized government\". \nThe primary claim for her release was that her detainment was due to a failure to provide her due process. She claimed that her fifth amendment rights were violated. Her claim referred to the answers she provided to an immigration hearing after her arrest in July 1918 (warrant issued June 24) where she admitted that she was a member of the IWW and believed \u201cin mass action and organization,\u201d but denied taking any actual actions. Further, her petition claimed that the evidence against her was based solely on IWW literature that was not actually in her possession at her arrest. Further still, she claimed that the government refused to even turn over the transcript of the hearing or the evidence they attached to it to enable her defence.\nThe judge approved her writ and demanded that the US government appear to demonstrate its cause for holding her.\nIn February 1919, the government did appear and provide the transcript of the hearing and the evidence against Roy. The judge ruled that her detainment was lawful and could continue. Presumably, she was deported afterward, but there is no evidence to be certain.\nIn March 1919, the government of the United States requested that the previously introduced evidence of Roy's hearing and IWW literature be removed from the case file and letters signed by Roy's lawyer agree to that removal.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "On November 28, 1877, Joseph Wells filed to retrieve custody of his minor wife, Matty, from her mother and step-father, Martha and William Church. Joseph alleged that on June 26 Martha and William had \"forcibly\" kidnapped Matty and that William did so in order to \"violate her chastity.\" William and Martha claimed that Matty came to their home willingly and was staying out of her own desire. In response, Joseph denied their claims and stated that the defendants threatened to kill him if he attempted to speak to Matty. \n\nWhile the judge's decision in the case is missing from the file, it appears as though Matty returned to live with Joseph from an 1880 census record.

Scott petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in order to establish custody of Adams, which was granted. At the same time, a case to annul their marriage on the grounds that Adams was developmentally disabled and unable to give her consent was also before the court. While the annulment and habeas corpus proceedings were pending, Adams was placed into the temporary custody of one A. A. H. Mayer. Ultimately, the court annulled the marriage between Scott and Adams but also allowed Scott's writ. The result was that although Adams was released from the custody of the Tabitha Home, Scott had no legal authority to assert custody over her.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "In 1903, Charles \"Chick\" Houghton was arrested in Multnomah County, Oregon, convicted of robbery, and sentenced to five years at the state penitentiary. In 1906, Houghton was granted \"conditional clemency,\" or parole, by the governor and released from prison early with the understanding that he would be returned to finish his sentence if convicted of any crime. He was then arrested again in Multnomah County, convicted of larceny, and returned to the state penitentiary. Houghton appealed this decision to the state supreme court and then filed a writ of habeas corpus in the Marion County Circuit Court, which was granted. Houghton argued that his detention was illegitimate since his conviction was under appeal. After hearing the evidence, the Circuit Court dismissed Houghton's petition and remanded him to the custody of the state penitentiary. Houghton immediately appealed this decision to the state supreme court, too. In early 1907, the state supreme court upheld the lower court's ruling.",

But I don't believe it's because Hammond purchased Anson; I'm fairly sure he was the deputy sheriff acting as jailer. Hammond appears as the holding party in a few other of the Missouri cases. Plus, there's this incredibly problematic law enforcement webpage claiming he was killed in 1836 (https://www.odmp.org/officer/5990-deputy-sheriff-george-hammond). \n\nAs for other freedom suits, I think we should distinguish between freedom suits, fugitive slave suits, and kidnapping suits. In kidnapping suits, the holding party is often going to be the kidnappers, although this suit shows that kidnappers occasionally deposited the people they seized with third parties. In freedom suits that don't involve kidnappers, the holding party is most likely going to be the enslaver. Is this helpful?\n\nP.S. It occurs to me that we don't actually have the habeas petition for this case. We have the petition for a writ of trespass/assault/false imprisonment, and we have the writ of habeas corpus, but we don't have the petition for the writ of habeas corpus. Should we assume that William Clark supplied that petition, too?\n\n<airtable:mention id=\"menHEbipq3ZBSbExy\">@Cory Young</airtable:mention>\u00a0this reading makes more sense to me; let's label Hammond as the holding party and jailer, while we label the Henrys as the kidnappers. I'm not ready to make a general rule, since I think many of these petitions will be idiosyncratic.\n\nThere's actually no habeas *petition*, here. Anson's next friend, William Clark, did not ask for the writ, but rather for five hundred dollars on a bill of trespass and assault. The judge appears to have issued a writ of habeas corpus of his own accord in order to proceed with the fact finding.",

With this agreement Yellow Sun et al. must later then appear in the District Court for Lancaster County. Interested parties, Eagle Chief and Tera-cowah acknowledge themselves as indebted to the State of Nebraska for five thousand dollars. Then, Samuel M. Janney and Jacob M. Troth also acknowledge themselves indebted in the same manner, but for the sum of one thousand dollars. \n(The portion after this comes from the additional sources, and is not in the document utilized for encoding into air table.) \n\nThis allows for all of the petitioners to be released as long as they return to Lancaster for further proceedings in October. Lastly, in October of 1971 Judge Lake releases them without bail and strikes the case, with the provision that if new evidence is available within 28 months they will be tried again. After 28 months passes they are truly free from proceedings. ",

Two days later Mifford and his attorneys filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus claiming that Mifford's arrest was illegal in that Cochrane acted under no legal authority, gave Mifford no reason for his arrest, and in that Mifford was being held in jail without due process of law. The same day as Mifford filed a petition, Thomas Burke, judge of the third judicial district of Washington Territory, granted said petition. The fate of Mifford and the case is unknown following Burke's order granting Mifford's petition. ",

Owen found a job and began working, but was imprisoned the following month after the governor rescinded the parole. Owen petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the rescission, which was granted. After hearing the evidence, the writ was denied and Owen remanded to the custody of the penitentiary. He appealed to the state supreme court, which affirmed the decision of the lower court.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "On November 25, 1887, Alice McKay filed a petition for a second writ of Habeas Corpus in King County Third District Court to receive custody of her eight-year-old daughter, Mary, from the custody of John and Della Keevan. Mary had been living with the Keevans for five years, the Sisters of Charity (Sisters of Providence) having placed Mary with them after Alice placed her daughter into the care of the sisters in 1882 while receiving medical treatment. Shortly after, Alice petitioned for custody of Alice. After having her initial writ denied, Alice utilized a different legal strategy in her second writ. Alice argued to Judge Roger Greene that the Keevans were unfit parents for Mary due to their Catholicism and that they were denying her visitation without reason. The Keevans argued that Alice was a drunk, immoral, abusive, and living in adultery with her neighbor Antone, \"a dark Italian.\" Alice countered by claiming that the Keevans were similarly immoral, and that her previous encounters with the law were due to abuse she faced from her now estranged husband, R. G. McKay. Before the court ordered a decision in the case of Mary's custody, Alice and her daughter, Katie, abducted Mary from the Keevans' home the day after Mary's twelfth birthday in 1891. Shortly after, the court ordered Alice to return Mary to the Keevans and Judge Isaac Lichtenberg, who took the case upon the death of Judge Jones, granted custody of Mary to the Keevans. A month after the ruling, Alice and her attorneys filed evidence to the court showing of Della's purchase of alcohol and personal correspondences indicating alcohol abuse. A year after the decision, the Keevans were granted a divorce on account of \"mutual abuse.\" ",

After hearing the evidence, the judge ruled that while the hospital could admit and detain Wilken, the Board of Commissioners had exceeded their authority in sentencing him for a period of time. The writ was denied and Wilken ordered to be returned to Gosper County to appear a second time before the Board of Commissioners.",

Miller and his wife, which was granted. Frank maintained that Mollie's father, Joseph Calhoun, had left Mollie in his charge when he left Oregon for the Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. Although Frank admitted that he had allowed Mollie to live with the Millers in the hope that she receive an education, he asserted that instead they were \"making a slave out of her.\" During the hearing, Frank withdrew his petition. An entry on page 34 of the Marion County Probate Index suggests that Mollie remained with the Millers.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "On December 9, 1876, nine mariners were arrested and charged with desertion after refusing to take the American Ship \"War Hawk\" to San Francisco. The petitioners claim they were wrongfully detained for this crime by a deputy US marshal. Instead of proceeding to the ordered location, the mariners landed at the port of discovery in Washington and were arrested there. The nine men petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming neglect was the cause for not proceeding to their ordered location. Their attorneys argued that while the \"War Hawk\" was able to provide the plaintiffs with suitable food, it neglected to do so and was an \"unseaworthy\" ship. Marshall Wyckoff responded that the said marines absented themselves without permission from the master or another officer of the said \"War Hawk\" and before the end of said voyage contract. John R. Lewis, a King County judge, ruled that the said plaintiffs were \"illegally restrained and imprisoned of their liberty\" and granted their petition.",

Alice's daughters were there for 1 year and 3 months and she was only allowed to see them through bars under the supervision of a woman referred to as \"Mother Superior.\" They were also taught Catholic practices which Alice believed effected them mentally and physically. She refers to them as being \"regular prisoners in fact.\" On March 22, 1899, Alice petitioned to get her children back and was granted custody on that same day. ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "William George Clarke, a man from Chicago, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that his two sons, Holley (19) and Caryl (8), were being deprived of their freedom by Mary E. Lyon and H. E. Wood. The respondents were the half-sibling and in-law, respectively, of Annie Carpenter Clarke, the deceased ex-wife of the petitioner and mother of the bound party who had moved to Lancaster County with the children following the divorce in 1901. Judge Holmes granted the petition. The respondents claimed that they were appointed guardians of the bound party and given control of Annie's estate by her request after her death in 1906. They also alleged that the petitioner did not ever financially support his children after the divorce. Additionally, they claimed that he had a violent temper and was addicted to \"intoxicating liquors,\" thus not making him a suitable guardian for his children. After hearing evidence, Judge Holmes denied the writ and ordered that the children remain in custody of Lyon and Wood, but that the petitioner be able to visit them at seasonable times. In the Court's decision, they also mention that the petitioner was currently going through another divorce from his second wife. Clarke then moved for the Court to grant him a new trial, which was overruled. The appearance docket shows that the Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed the Court's decision in 1909. ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Frank G. Bevans petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that his ten-year-old biological daughter, Gussie Bevans, was being deprived of her liberty by Frank's ex-wife and Gussie's mother, Winnie Crandall. Frank and Winnie had divorced years previously, and the court awarded custody to F. L. Knight, whose relationship to any named party is unknown. Judge Holmes granted the petition. In her response, Crandall claimed that Frank should not be given custody because he lives in Wyoming and that Knight was not a proper guardian because he had moved with his family to York, Nebraska--away from Crandall. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Holmes ruled that custody of the bound party would be awarded to Louise R. Upton, Matron of the School for Girls (Brownell Hall) in Omaha, Nebraska for five years. Frank G. Bevans filed two additional motions, one in June of 1900 and one in June of 1901, requesting that Gussie Bevans be allowed to spend summer vacation with her parents (equally split between them), which all parties agreed to.",

Weeks previous, Cohn had successfully petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, was remanded to custody, and filed an appeal in the Supreme Court. While that petition was pending, Cohn successfully petitioned for a writ after he had been remanded into custody again. Judge Tibbetts ruled that because Cohn had been committed a second time for the same offense, Cohn was deprived of his liberty. Tibbetts ordered that Cohn be released.",

Painter, a physician, and her presumed relative, Joseph Painter.

After hearing testimony, Judge Pound declared that William Marshall was not deprived of his liberty. Although he ordered that William remain in the custody of the holding party, Pound ordered that the petitioner be able to visit her son at all reasonable times and that in six months she could petition to modify the custody agreement.",

Jane Williams, whose relationship to Robinson is unclear, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on his behalf, which was granted. In the meantime, Robinson posted a $200 bail and was released. The respondents failed to answer the writ, and so Robinson was released from their custody. Peter Johnstone, the police chief, was ordered to pay Williams' court costs.",

Malin after it was discovered that he had secretly aided mothers of the Sac and Fox Tribe in taking their children from the American Indian Boarding School at Toledo back to the tribe's reservation. There was a previous trial in this same case which determined that Peters had been wrongfully imprisoned. The judge ruled that Malin's court appointed guardianship of the children whom Peters had taken from the school was not legal, and therefore void. The judge also ruled that the state did not have the right to interfere in the proceedings of the school, because it was a federal institution and its attendees federal wards. Furthermore, the criminal laws of the state did not apply to the Native Americans and their tribes, and would only apply if a member of the tribe was involved in an act which \"brought him within the plane of the legislative jurisdiction of the state.\" It was argued that this would apply only in a small number of cases. The ruling of this retrial is unknown.\n\n",

He had previously appealed to the Nebraska State Supreme Court, who had upheld the verdict. Granger argued that he was imprisoned under the NE House of Representatives bill no. 87 \"an act to punish cattle stealing...\" when the bill had not passed, making his incarceration unconstitutional. Judge Holmes granted the petition. After hearing evidence, Holmes denied the writ and remanded Granger back into the custody of the warden.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "On behalf of Edward and Martha Shelmidine, William H. Moore petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that they were unlawfully detained by Gable (first name unknown), a marshal in Waverly, Nebraska. Judge Cornish granted the petition. In Gable's response, he alleges that he is holding the couple on orders of the Governor of Texas, Joseph D. Sayers, who issued an extradition warrant. In case files, Martha Shelmidine is also referred to as Mrs. M. M. Claxton. After reviewing evidence, Judge Cornish allowed the writ and ordered that the Shelmidines be released from custody. According to secondary source research, Martha was allegedly previously married in Texas and married Edward in Nebraska. She was allegedly facing charges of bigamy in Texas, which is presumably why Sayers issued an extradition warrant.",

After hearing the evidence, Joseph was remanded to the custody of the Kimmels. The Davises appealed to the state supreme court, which overturned the decision of the lower court. Ultimately, it was found that the child's father, Joseph M. Kimmel, had \"voluntarily relinquished\" his right to the boy. The court awarded custody of Joseph R. Kimmel to the Davis family but allowed his father to have him on Sundays as well as \"four days in any month, with one week's notice.\"",

When Hubbard's lawyers went to the jail and asked what he was incarcerated for, the jailer claimed that he was arrested for vagrancy, but then changed his answer suggesting instead that he was jailed for being a \u201csuspicious character,\u201d which was not an offense of the law. His lawyers claimed that it was common practice for the Omaha police to throw people in jail with the goal of running them out of town. Hubbard was characterized as being a black man who had previously protested against the chief of police for throwing other black people in jail without cause and leaving them there for \u201cindefinite lengths of time.\u201d Therefore Hubbard believed his arrest was retaliation from the Chief. He also was in bad health and thought that if he had to stay in jail \u201cit might even cause his death.\u201d Ultimately, his writ was approved and he was allowed to have his case brought to the court. \n",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Mary Ann Speaks was born in Alexandria, Virginia--then the District of Columbia--around 1811. In 1836, Speaks claimed, her mother had her bound to Susan Blunt for ten years as an apprentice in housewifery. Blunt promised to free Speaks from her apprenticeship two years early if she agreed to accompany her to St. Louis, to which Speaks agreed. After Speaks had labored nearly eight years as an apprentice in housewifery, Blunt died without making a will. Her administrator, James Quisenberry, acknowledged that Speaks was a free woman, but desired that she pay two years' wages in order to liberate herself from the Blunt estate. When Speaks refused, Quisenberry had her jailed, and Speaks petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted. Her petition invoked the law of apprenticeship, of estates, and of servitude. After hearing the evidence, Speaks was released.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Following the removal of the Ponca tribe from their homelands in Nebraska to poor lands in Indian Territory (Oklahoma) and the death of Standing Bear's son, Standing Bear and 29 Ponca left the Oklahoma reservation without the permission of their Indian agent. The group made their way up through Kansas and into Nebraska on foot and stopped at the Omaha Reservation. The Omaha welcomed them as they had long been allies, but orders were issued for the thirty Poncas arrest. A newspaper editor extensively published columns about the proceedings and gathered the two attorneys to make Standing Bear's case. A writ of habeas corpus was issued by Judge Elmer Dundy, and in the trial proceedings, the United States government argued that writs of habeas corpus could only be utilized by citizens of the United States or those considered \"human.\" According to this argument, Standing Bear and Indigenous peoples at large were not considered human and therefore should not be able to use writs of habeas corpus to defend themselves in court. Standing Bear's attorneys argued that their clients had cut ties with the Ponca tribe in Oklahoma, had made their intentions known to the Indian agent, that their return to Nebraska was legal and they had not broken any laws. Judge Dundy found for Standing Bear and the group of thirty was to be released. Following the trial, Standing Bear's group was not immediately allowed to return to their homelands as the land had been given to the Lakota nor could they return to the Omaha Reservation for fear of further arrest.

James petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve Willard, which was granted. After hearing the evidence, the court ordered that James and Pearl share custody of Willard while their divorce was pending. Each was to have custody of Willard for one week at a time, dropping the boy off at the office of James' attorney, E. E. Spencer, on Saturday afternoons. Neither was to remove Willard from Lancaster County nor take him to their relatives' homes without permission of the other. Once this was decided, James withdrew his petition.",

Witnesses Tate, Russel, and Garnett attest that Johnson had a lot of money with him around the time Pritchard's money was taken, around June 4th or 5th of 1915. While Kennedy declares cause for extradition so Johnson can be tried in Canada, Johnson petitions for writ of habeas corpus, arguing the statements against him to be untrue and without probable cause or legal evidence.

He has been detained in the jail but there is no complaint against him whatsoever. Judge Baker affirmed an original writ of Habeas Corpus, ordering that he be discharged from being restrained of his personal liberty. The state recognized that they had received copies of the writ and that they had personally delivered the writ to H. P. Haze. The District Court Judge, W. W. Slabaugh, under the Clerk Albyn L.

Arrested on the charge of embezzlement and sentenced to serve time in the state penitentiary, Mills had appealed his case to the NE Supreme Court, who suspended his sentence and allowed him to enter into bail. Vallecott claimed that the order from the Supreme Court supersedes any order that John Doe was acting upon. Judge Holmes granted the petition.

Their writ was approved, but C.V Storz and the other unnamed petitioner were not released from custody because their lawyer only filed habeas for them to obtain counsel and not to be released. \n",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Angelo Rose was visiting Omaha, NE from Ohio to visit relatives. He stated that he planned to return to Ohio within 2-3 weeks and had not left Ohio for the purpose of avoiding arrest. He was arrested 28 August 1899 and had been held for two days without a hearing and had not yet been scheduled for a hearing. Further, he states that he is not guilty of any crime in any jurisdiction. It was reported that he embezzled money from individuals in Ohio but he had not yet been found guilty. The individuals who filed that report were aware that the petitioner was leaving Ohio and intended to visit Omaha, NE. \n\nA complaint was filed on 11 August 1899 stating that Rose left Cuyahoga County, Ohio on or around 1 August 1899 and was a fugitive of justice for embezzlement. This document was signed by George C. Cockrell, Justice of the Peace. On 31 August 1899, the writ was allowed and Judge Baker wrote to Sheriff McDonald and asked that Rose be released to the custody of the State of Ohio. On 1 September 1899, Rose was ordered to be released from the custody of Douglas County to the custody of the State of Ohio. A supplemental petition was filed on 1 September 1899 stating that the representative of the Governor of Ohio did not have authority and, further, that Rose was not a fugitive from justice per the requisition papers from the State of Ohio and that no affidavit or indictment had been produced by the Governor of Ohio stating that Mr. E. D. Barry had authority to arrest Rose. The proceedings following this second petition are detailed in case file (hc.case.ne.1449).",

Auble, agent of the state of California on behalf of W. H. Markham, governor of California. Thomas Van Sciever, and his agent and wife Addie Van Sciever, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that chief of police P. H. Cooper and agent W. H. Auble were depriving him of his liberty. Judge Hall granted the petition. After hearing evidence, Judge Tibbetts remanded him to the custody of Sherriff Miller. Van Sciever filed a writ of error and appealed to the Nebraska Supreme Court, who in 1897 affirmed the decision. ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Following the death of his parents when he was about ten years old, John Heo had lived with a white family away from the Indian reservations that his parents belonged to and had severed his tribal relations for nearly twenty-five years. R. H. Milroy, the Indian Agent of the Nisqually and Puyallup Agency, arrested Heo when he refused to return to the agency and cohabit with an Indian woman, presumably his wife. Heo petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus which was granted, and the trial was heard by Judge Hoyt. Milroy argued that all Indians living in or coming to the agency are under his jurisdiction and that he was justified in requiring Heo to return to the reservation to live with his wife and child. Heo argued that because he had severed ties with his nation, had never lived on a reservation since his parents' death, and has adopted a Western lifestyle, Milroy did not have sufficient justification to arrest him. Judge Hoyt, after hearing the evidence, ruled in favor of Milroy, and Heo remained in custody. ",

Judge Frost granted the petition. When Walton was judged insane by a commission, they ruled that he was not dangerous and could be released. Walton's assigned guardian, John Taylor, also claimed that Walton had the means to provide for himself if released. After hearing this evidence, Judge Frost denied the writ and ordered that Walton be remanded back into the custody of Greene.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Columbia George was convicted of murdering Anna Edna, a Cayuse woman living on the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. First, he was sent to the Oregon State Penitentiary at Salem, Oregon. Then, he was transferred to the custody of C. B. Hopkins at the Federal Penitentiary on McNeil's Island in Puget Sound, Washington. George appealed the decision, and George argued that because he had faced injustice by the hands of the judge. The case initially went to the Supreme Court of Oregon. The judge denied his writ of Habeas Corpus and ruled that a state court did not have the authority to rule in the case. The case was then sent to a US circuit court. George argued that the Supreme Court jurists had judged him as an Indian ward, and not a U.S. citizen who subject to both federal and state law (whereas an Indian ward would have been strictly subject to federal statute), and therefore should have granted his petition and heard the case. This was due to his receipt of an allotment of land by the U.S. government under the Dawes Act, which when accepted, changed his legal status to a U.S. citizen, an no longer an Indian Ward of the United States government. The case went to the United States District Court where the jury convicted him guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. George appealed, and was reportedly tried again, and was once more convicted of murder. The archives lack these documents, but the case is referenced in this case, no. 1390, in Judge Hanford\u2019s denial and dismissal of George\u2019s petition for wrongful imprisonment by Charles E. Hopkins at the US Penitentiary at McNeil Island. George appealed a fourth time and was dismissed.\n\n",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "In January of 1874, Han Lee filed a petition on behalf of Seo Kim, a Chinese woman who was allegedly being held by Ah Chow in the Seattle area. Han Lee believed that Ah Chow intended to cross the border into Victoria and sell Seo Kim. It was also known that a man named Ah Ying had obtained a marriage license to marry Seo Kim, which Han Lee believed Seo Kim desired. Han Lee previously bought Seo Kim in China and believed that he was losing his property. Ah Chow denied that he was detaining Seo Kim. When ordered by the court to bring her in, he claimed that he had never held her captive nor had he any intent on selling her across the border. Even after a court order was issued, he refused to appear before Judge Orange Jacobs. The sheriff, H.G. Thornton was ordered to arrest and bring Seo Kim into custody. He brought her in but was not able to bring Ah Chow in at that time. A warrant was then issued for Ah Chow\u2019s arrest, but Thornton could not find him, claiming he must have been hiding out somewhere in Seattle. Seo Kim was discharged from custody and the petition was dismissed.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "On May 21, 1887, Moses Cline (also known as BM Cline or Moses Brown Cline) filed a writ of Habeas Corpus on behalf of his four-year-old daughter, Elnora Cline, in the Third Judicial District Court in King County, Washington. Elnora had been living with her mother and Moses' wife, Ella Cline, in Seattle since April 15, 1887. Moses claimed that as a single mother, Ella would be unable to maintain the best interest of Elnora and that as a caring and capable father he not only possessed a legal right to custody of his child, but that Elnora would benefit from being in his custody. In response, Ella maintained that she had a legal right to custody of Elnora and that Elnora's age required the care of her mother. While the remaining files for the case are missing following Ella's return to the writ, Elnora seems to have gone into Moses' custody for a brief period, given that Moses listed Elnora as the sole other member of his household on the 1889 Kitsap County Census.

She had tried to regain her children before this and could never prove that she was financially stable enough to take them on and give them a better life than they had in the society homes. ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "This supplemental petition was filed because Rose claimed that no \u201cproper or legal complaint\u201d had been filed against him as required by law. He states that he is not a fugitive from justice but was visiting relatives in Omaha and had not left Ohio for the purpose of avoiding arrest. This file offers a restatement of the facts from the prior file; Rose was arrested wrongly, he was held without trial and no news of a trial being scheduled, he claims to have not committed any crime in Ohio and, thus, cannot be a fugitive from the law.\n\nThe form from the Justice of the Peace (George C. Cockrell) states that a complaint was submitted by Deputy Sheriff Louis Grebe on 31 August 1899 stating that on or about 1 August 1899, Rose was a fugitive from justice from Common Court in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Deputy Grebe claims that Rose stood accused of the crime of embezzlement (a sum of $300), committed in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. \n\nGeorge C. Cockrell (Justice of the Peace) signed an order on 1 September 1899 to the Keeper of the Common Jail to keep Angelo Rose for \u201cfurther examination,\u201d as he had been charged with committing the offence of Fugitive from Justice. An order that the Sheriff release Rose to allow him to appear in court on 1 September 1899 was submitted on 31 August 1899 by Coblyn L. Frank (Clerk). \n\nJudge B. S. Baker ordered that Rose\u2019s writ be allowed and ordered that a writ of habeas corpus be issued in favor of Angelo Rose, returnable on 1 September 1899 at 2:00pm directed to Sheriff John McDonald.

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Louis Seiffer, alias David S. Berman, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that warden of the State Penitentiary Leidigh was depriving him of his freedom. Seiffer had been arrested on the charge of forgery, fined, and sentenced to five years imprisonment \"and kept at hard labor.\" Seiffer claimed that before his initial trial in Furnas County's District Court, deputy sheriff A. E. Peterson insinuated that Seiffer would be lynched and hung and that the gathered crowd joined in the intimidation. Additionally, he claimed that he was told that if he pled guilty, he would only receive one year in prison. Judge Hall allowed the petition. After hearing evidence, Hall granted a Seiffer a \"writ of relief\" from the custody of Leidigh and ordered that Seiffer be transferred into the custody of Furnas County sheriff to await additional legal action. According to the August 11, 1895, Chicago Chronicle, Seiffer (spelled Seiffert) was a well-known forger throughout the United States. ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Albert and Loretta Sheldon divorced in 1888. Five years later, Loretta, who had remarried, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to establish custody of their son, Hallie. Loretta claimed that the divorce settlement had not determined custody; Albert countered that the settlement had granted custody of Hallie and his brother, Olliver, to himself and custody of a third son, Walter, to Loretta. After hearing the evidence, Hallie was remanded to the custody of Albert and Loretta ordered to pay his court fees. ",

Flaherty petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that the ordinance used to convict him in Police Court was unconstitutional, therefore, he was being deprived of his liberty. Judge Holmes granted the petition. In his statement, Holmes claimed that the charge and arrest dealt with public morality, not public safety, thus it was not a valid exercise of police power. He also ruled that Flaherty's method of advertising was not improper, and that the ordinance he was charged with violating was unconstitutional. He cites rulings in several other states. He allowed the writ and ordered that Flaherty be released from custody. ",

On July 15th, Milton moved to dismiss the cause, which Judge Cornish granted. A simultaneous legal action, \"In the Matter of the guardianship of Milton F.

Judge Holmes granted the petition; however, after hearing evidence, he remanded Conroy back into custody. One month later, Conroy filed a motion to amend the record after Sherriff Miller admitted guilt. The motion was granted, but presumably Conroy remained in custody. Two years later, a Supreme Court decision affirmed the court's decision.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Coley Harris was arrested and jailed on suspicion of being a fugitive from slavery. She declared that she was a free woman and petitioned the St. Louis Criminal Court for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted by one Judge Lackland. After hearing the evidence, she was released. However, Harris, in consultation with her attorney, was then arrested and jailed for a second time in an attempt to prevent her original kidnapper, Rueben Bartlett, from seizing her again. This time she petitioned the St. Louis Commissioner's Court for a writ of habeas corpus, which was also granted. Upon hearing the evidence, Harris was once again released.\n\nMark Twain believed that Harris had been posing as a slave to avoid punishment for having entered the state as a free Black woman without proper license. See Mark Twain's Letters, vol. 1, 1853 to 1866, eds. Edgar Marquez Branch et al (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 51. (https://books.google.com/books?id=IPgkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA51)",

Akoun et al. were unlawfully detained after a violation of a pretened order of injunction in the original case against the Trans-Missisippi and International and Oriental Exhibition Company. They alleged there was no process according and that they were denied the right to be separately tried for the alleged violation of the injunction. After that trial ended, they were arrested because they hadn't paid their fines. After filing for the writ of habeas corpus, the writ was allowed, the case was heard, and it was determined they were being unlawfully held so they were released from custody. ",

He argued in his habeas corpus petition that police judge Albert F. Parsons violated his right to due process and that his business, a general goods store, exempted him from following the ordinance; therefore, he was being deprived of his liberty by Marshall P. H. Cooper. In April of 1888, Judge Allen Field remanded Leiberman into custody until he was released on bond on April 24th on the sum of $100. ",

Before the hearing took place, Martinez approached the judge and requested the dismissal of the case, and both parties agreed to drop the case. By order of Judge Alsop Clara and Johana were to stay in the custody of the sheriff until the August hearing had ended. ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "John F. Decker petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that he was unlawfully detained by Sheriff Nicholas Ress. Judge Holmes granted the petition and allowed him bail at the sum of 300 dollars. Decker had been arrested on the charge of perjury after he falsely claimed during a divorce trial that he was a resident of Lancaster County, Nebraska. After hearing evidence, Judge Holmes ruled that Decker had not committed perjury and therefore was being illegally detained. He ordered that Decker be released from custody. However, he ordered that the County Attorney, James L. Caldwell, prosecute Decker for the charge of contempt of court and punish him accordingly. Caldwell immediately followed through in State of Nebraska vs John F. Decker where again Decker was released on bail. The outcome of this case is unknown. Weeks later, Caldwell produced a motion for a re-hearing and a new trial for Decker's habeas corpus case, which the court overruled. In 1906, Caldwell's appeal was tried in the Nebraska Supreme Court, who later dismissed his petition in error.",

A month later, the Sisters placed Mary into the care of John and Della Keevan, telling Alice that they were doing so for Mary to receive \"fresh country air.\" Alice argued that she had frequently attempted to visit Mary and retrieve her from the Keevans, but was prevented from doing so after the Keevans threatened to shoot her. Alice claimed that the Keevans \"unlwafully and cruelly bed, abuse, and otherwise ill treat\" Mary, and that the Keevans had no legitimate legal claim to the custody of Mary. The Keevans responded by claiming that Alice abandoned Mary and left her in a poor physical condition, and that \"by reason of this poverty and indigent circumstances she was unable to support and maintain it.\" The Keevans further argued that they were financially and mentally capable of providing Mary with a moral education and superior material means. While the case file itself does not contain a case outcome, it is indicated in Alice's second petition for custody of Mary in 1887 that this writ was denied on account of Alice's poverty. ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "On October 16, 1868, an order had been issued by Charles E. Mix, the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, that stated that Native peoples would not be allowed to visit Washington D.C. due to lack of federal funding. Moses Keokuk, the Chief of the Sac & Fox Indians, used his own money to leave the reservation and visit Washington. On his way out of Kansas, he was arrested on November 23, 1868 by Albert Wiley, the Indian Agent for the Sac & Fox Indians.  On this order, Keokuk was transported to the county jail of Douglas County and held there for two days. Keokuk petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus which was granted. He continue to sue for damages against Wiley. After hearing the evidence, the jury found for Keokuk. Wiley filed for a new trial, and appealed to the Kansas Supreme Court. After reviewing the evidence, the Supreme Court of Kansas upheld the decision of the District Court. ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Flora Ohler and Joseph Gielday divorced in January 1893. Custody of their two young daughters, Naomi and Leona Gielday, was awarded to Flora. According to Flora, she moved to Iowa and re-married, while Joseph moved to Red Willow County, Nebraska, and took ill. Flora allowed Naomi and Leona to visit Joseph in order to help take care of him. At some point, Leona returned to her mother while Naomi remained with her father. When Joseph died in February 1898, a pair of brothers named Charles and George Shafer contrived to have custody of Naomi awarded to Charles, arguing that she had no relatives living in the state. Flora petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve Naomi, which was granted. Flora argued that she was Naomi's rightful guardian and that Charles \"only desires the custody of said minor child to gratify his own licentious designs and to accommodate the lust of his single brother George.\" Charles countered that Flora was an abusive mother, that Naomi remained with the Shafers of her own volition, and that the District Court of Lancaster County, Nebraska had no jurisdiction over Red Willow County. After hearing the evidence, fourteen-year-old Naomi Gielday was remanded to the custody of Charles Shafer.",

He states that he does not know the cause of his detention and that no complaint has been filed against him anywhere in the state of Nebraska which would charge him with \u201cthe commission of any crime or being a fugitive from justice.\u201d The petitioner was informed that Gallagher arrested him at the request of an officer from Oklahoma based on a request being sent by telegram. The petitioner has not seen the telegrams and has no means of procuring a copy. Therefore, he asked that a writ of habeas corpus be issued so he can be discharged from the unlawful imprisonment. \nJudge Simpson (?) allowed the writ on 23 March 1898. On 25 March 1898 Judge Slabaugh dismissed the cause and sustained the motion of the writ, ordering that Douglas be released.",

Carlton petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the commitment from N. Soderberg did not show Carlton had been convicted, that the court who issued the commitment did not have jurisdiction over the issue, and that it was not a commitment at all. R. A. Jones, a District Judge, ordered that the defendant should remain in custody on April 28, 1888, and Carlton returned to the custody of William Cochrane, the sheriff of King County, Washington Territory.

When Johanna presented her case the judge could see no issue with the state or cleanliness of the children and reported they chose to stay with their mother initially. The outcome of the case was that Hermann regained custody of the four children after the final day of trial. ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Petitioner, George Compton, was arrested on 21 April 1898 on a vagrancy charge. On that same day, he was assigned to the county jail for a period of 30 days. He was not granted a trial at this point. \nPolice Judge Gordon issued a mittimus, stating that this 30 day sentence had been imposed at an earlier date but was suspended based on the condition that Compton leave the city and not return. The initial sentence had been imposed on 6 December 1897. The Police Judge asserts that he failed to comply with these terms; leading to his arrest in Omaha on the charge of vagrancy, and was placed in the County Jail to complete his initial sentence. On 21 April 1898, a writ for the offense of vagrancy was submitted by Police Judge Gordon and signed by Sheriff McDonald and Deputy Sheriff Lewis detailing these claims. \nThe case was heard by the District Court (Judge Slabaugh) on 6 May 1898. During this trial, Judge Slabaugh determined that no offense had been committed, that Compton was unlawfully being deprived of his liberty, and that Sheriff McDonald should release him from custody. On 7 May 1898, Judge Slabaugh signed an Order to Discharge the Prisoner on Writ of Habeas Corpus. \nOn 17 May 1898, a document was submitted by the Albyn L. Frank (District Court Clerk) motioning for Douglas County to pay the costs of the trial.",

When he did not pay the fine, Hull was placed in the custody of the King County Sherriff at the King County Jail. Hull filed a writ of habeas corpus arguing that he should be entitled to bail and was being illegally kept without a set bail. Judge Greene granted the writ and set a bail amount of $500 to go into effect on July 1, 1884, the first day of the Supreme Court of Washington Territory's new session. In Olympia, WA, he could be let out of jail before the territorial Supreme Court with a payment of $500. Hull's fate following the April 25, 1884 ruling is unknown.\n",

She petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus by her next friend, Lona McMasters, which was granted. Gladys, whose husband, Harold Fuson, was seeking a divorce, declared that Harold had orchestrated her detention as retribution for her leaving his household and in order to prevent her from defending herself in the divorce suit. The respondents countered, citing jurisdictional and procedural reasons why the writ of habeas corpus should not lie. After hearing the evidence, Gladys was remanded back into the custody of the superintendent of the King County Juvenile Detention Home.",

Caufield committed Charles Barnes to the jail of King County, Washington Territory for 35 days or until Barnes paid a total of $104.55 in fines for his involvement in the breaking and entering of the house of Charles Forger and the shooting of Eugene Cote by John Barnes on January 3, 1886 in a dispute over a child. On January 6, 1886, Barnes and his lawyers filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to Judge Roger S. Greene in King County claiming that Barnes had not received due process under the law and was being held without a trial or the court filing any charges against him. Greene granted the petition and the writ of Habeas Corpus was filed, however, the case files following the writ are missing. A newspaper article covering the case on January 7, 1886, states that Barnes was released from custody on the evening of the 6th and would be required to come before a jury regarding his January 4th charges. The fate of Charles following his release is unknown. ",

Wilbur petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that his license was valid, therefore, he was being unlawfully detained by sheriff Ress. Judge Holmes granted the petition.

Fox was unable to pay and detained and sentenced to forty-one (41) days of hard labor for refusal to pay a fine. Afterward, Fox filed for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing his complaint against Wiggins was not frivolous, and, therefore he should not be charged with the court costs. Judge J. R.

        "Summary of Proceedings": "In 1886 Can- ah- couqua filed for a writ of habeas corpus to regain custody of her son who had been at the Indian Training School at Sitka, AK for three years without leave. The defendants argued that Can-ah-couqua had signed an agreement with the school in 1883-when her son was five years old- to relinquish her parental custody for a period of five years. They argued that it was for the well being and education of the boy, Con-ca-bach, that he remain in the school and not be allowed to return to his \"uncivilized\" mother. Can-ah-couqua argued that she had never been presented any sort of contract or verbally agreed to give- up custody of her son to the school. She further asserted that Con-ca-dach was suffering physically from the poor conditions of the school building, overworked, and unfed. He was also frequent physically and verbally abused by teachers and other staff members of the school. Furthermore, she had not been able to see her son in three years, since he had been taken from her. As part of the petitioner's evidence, Can-ah-couqua;'s attorney submitted a letter that had been written by Con-ca-dach to the governor of Alaska, A. P. Swineford, saying that he wished to be taken out of the school, and returned to his mother. Judge Dawson ruled in favor of the defendants, writing that Can-ah-couqua had relinquished custody for five years in her \"agreement\" with the school, and it was in the best interest of the child to continue to receive a proper education. Can-ah-couqua was, however, allowed to occasionally visit Con-ca-dach at the school, provided that the there was adequate supervisor by school officials. ",

She was brought there under the guardianship of her court-appointed guardian, Malin. Her husband petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under his and her name. Circuit judge, O. P. Shiras ruled that Malin had no right to guardianship over Lelah Puc-Ka-Chee, who was released from his custody and was granted her freedom. Furthermore, Shiras asserted that as a married woman, and therefore a legal adult, Puc-Ka-Chee had the right to decide whether or not she would remain enrolled at the school. ",

The petitioner believes there is no other cause of her restraint \"other than unkindness and willful desire to make a slave\" of her. They also site in the petition that George calls her his slave and that she could not leave. Fannie \"frequent made attempts to get away\" which resulted in the respondent catching her and \"severely beat and wound her\" for attempting to leave. It is stated she is being held \"in the County of King on a Street of said City known as Third Street between what is known as Columbia and Madison Street, just one door from the said Columbia street next to the certain hotel known as the Columbia House.\" The petition was granted and the writ was served on Finleyson, but there is no further information about her release.

        "Summary of Proceedings": "On July 16, 1886, notary public William J. Houston was tasked with receiving a deposition from Bertha Dogge on a civil case, Hart Bros., et al vs. Otto Dogge, Bertha Dogge, and Christian G. Herald. Bertha Dogge refused, and Houston found her in contempt of court and ordered her arrest. On July 22, 1886, Bertha Dogge petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that sheriff Samuel Melick had unlawfully deprived her of her freedom. After examining the evidence, Judge Pound remanded her into the custody of Melick. The next day, Supreme Court Judge Amasa Cobb upheld the decision, but he allowed Bertha to file a writ of error and ruled that Bertha be able to be released on her own recognizance provided that she pay a sum of $250.",

According to the document signed by a representative from the school and Ah- lit- quah, Nu-Shukk was also placed in the custody of Charles N. Replogle until she reach 18 years of age, or was discharged by Replogle for whatever reason. Ah- Lit- Quah took her daughter out of school shortly after enrollment and refused to return the child to the superintendent. Replogle filed a writ of habeas corpus for the child. The writ was granted and Judge Warren Truitt ordered Ah- lit- quah to bring Nu- Shukk to court. When she did not comply with the order, a warrant for her arrest was issued. Ah- lit- quah was arrested and Nu- Shukk was returned to the boarding school under the custody of Replogle. ",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Janet Mackay, formerly Janet Roy, a Scottish woman residing in the US was arrested on June 24th, 1918 for plotting to overthrow the US government and holding materials advocating sedition and socialism. She and her sister initially immigrated to New York in October of 1916, where they worked as housekeepers. They then head to Chicago where they find work in bindery for the newly formed Industrial Workers of the World.\u200b\u200b In October 1918 the Roy sisters moved to Seattle, Washington despite investigation into their ties to the IWW. The are arrested shortly after. The sisters are held in custody by Henry M. White, the sheriff and US Commissioner of immigration for Seattle. The case is heard by judge Jeremiah Neterer in the US District Court for Washington. While temporarily out on bond and while awaiting deportation, Janet marries Ian Valentine Mackay, a fellow Scottish immigrant who believes he is a naturalized citizen. The court dismissed his claim of citizenship and the marriage did not certify Janet a citizen who cannot be deported. Mackay's attorney repeatedly asks about the fairness of the case-in part because of the relationship between Judge Neterer and defendant White. In March of 1919 the case is decided and Janet\u2019s application for a Writ of habeas is denied. Janet Mackay is officially ordered to be deported. ",

Petitioner Henry Bell is, thus, asking for a writ of habeas corpus to be issued on the grounds of unlawful imprisonment (deprivation of liberty). The writ was filed and granted on 2 April 1898. Judge Slabaugh ordered that Bell be returned on 4 April 1898, directing that order to Sheriff McDonald. A copy of the writ was officially filed with the Sheriff on 2 April 1898. A document was entered to the record stating that Henry Bell should be kept in custody for further examination as he had been charged with drunkenness on 26 March 1898; this record was signed and ordered by Police Judge Samuel I. Gordon. \n\nBell appeared in court on 4 April 1898 and Judge Slambaugh signed an order releasing him on that same day stating, \u201cit is therefore ordered that said Henry Bell be discharged from the custody of John McDonald Sheriff and from said unlawful detention.\"\n\nOn 17 May 1898, a motion was filed by Ablyn L. Frank (Clerk for the District Court) asking that the costs be taxed to Douglas County and paid out of the County Treasury. The motion was sustained and the County was ordered to pay the sum. ",

Jackson petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the Marion County Circuit Court, which was granted.

After hearing the evidence, Jackson was released. ; A second petition was found in this file. There is no obvious relationship between the two petitions.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Aspasia was born in Kaskaskia, Illinois around 1806 to an enslaved mother who allegedly had been brought to the region before the passing of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Aspasia was treated as enslaved herself and sold to multiple parties. In 1821, Pierre Menard purchased the girl from Baptiste Gindreau. Shortly thereafter, Menard gave Aspasia to his daughter and son-in-law, Bernice and Francois Chouteau, who brought her to St. Louis. Late in 1827, Aspasia petitioned for the right to sue as a poor person and to have her freedom determined by the court. She charged Francois Chouteau and Pierre Menard with assault, battery, and false imprisonment and asked for $1,000 in damages. In response to the charge, Menard had Aspasia jailed, at which point she petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted. Her fate is unknown, although the defendants in her freedom suit claimed that she was legally enslaved because her mother had been brought to Northwest Territory before the passage of the 1787 Ordinance, which broadly prohibited the introduction of enslaved people into the region.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Taik (Emma Hamilton) was a 13 year old Tlingit girl who was taken to the Sheldon Jackson Institute (aka Indian Training School at Sitka) in January of 1885 by Sheldon Jackson and Alonzo E. Austin. Taik's mother was said to have died around March 1885, and one Anna Vine became the parent- appointed guardian of the child. The story was that after the death of Hitch- sah- See, Taik's mother, Vine came in March 1885 to take Taik from the school to her home in Victoria, British Columbia, the school administrators, including Jackson and Austin refused to grant the release. When her complaints for release went unanswered, Hitch- sah- See filed for a writ of habeas corpus with her husband, Don- ah- Clah, against Jackson, Austin, and a woman referred to as \"Mrs. McFarland.\" After the case was filed it was discovered that Taik's mother had not actually died, but was still alive, as was her father, Don-ah-clah. The case was transferred to them, and they became the new petitioners. The defendants argued that they had made a verbal agreement to enroll Taik for a period of 5 years in the school with her parents. With this alleged verbal agreement, the defendants claimed to be the legal guardians of Taik.  Judge Ward McAllister ruled against the defendant, in favor of Hitch- sah- see and Don-ah-clah. He wrote that the school officials had no authority to make \"contracts with Indians\" under the provisions of the federal government. Additionally, administrators could not take Native children from their parents, and were required to return them if that's what parents wished. ",

Blevins petitioned for writs of habeas corpus in the county and circuit courts to retrieve his three young sons, Henry, John, and Thomas, from his father-in-law, Thomas Small, both of which were granted. Smalls claimed that his grandchildren refused to return to their father, saying that they \"cried Piteously\" at the thought of leaving. Smalls added that Blevins was an unfit parent, and that for the past three years Smalls and his wife, Elizabeth, had been supporting Blevins and the children. After hearing the evidence, the district court judge remanded the three boys to the custody of their father. Blevins and Smalls spent the next two years litigating a property dispute in civil court.",

        "Summary of Proceedings": "Samuel Carr petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve his two young sons, Harry and Herbert Carr, from William and Nina Helms, which was granted. A few years earlier, Samuel had placed the boys in the Home for the Friendless in Lincoln, Nebraska, from which institution the Helmses obtained custody of the two. The Helmses did not formally adopt Harry and Herbert, whom they put to work in their traveling minstrel show. After hearing the evidence, Harry and Herbert were released back into the custody of the Home for the Friendless. The judge ordered that Samuel could retrieve his children once he demonstrated that he could properly care for them and after he paid off his debt to the state. \n\nFor background on this case, see the 15 and 16 November 1906 issues of the Hastings Daily Republican. https://www.newspapers.com/clip/97397389/samuel-l-carrs-habeas-corpus-petition/\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/97397717/samuel-l-carrs-habeas-corpus-petition/",

In retaliation, Kadlec took Kasper's watch and told him that he would not return it until he got his glasses back. Kasper then filed a complaint claiming Kadlec had committed grand larceny for taking the watch. Kadlec was described as being a \u201cforeigner, unable to read or write the English language readily\u201d and therefore did not have a good understanding of the law. He was the sole provider for his wife and 5 kids and during his incarceration one his sons died and his family is experiencing starvation and poverty. For these reasons, he wanted to be released from jail. The judge approved his writ and Kadlec was called to have his case tried in court. ",

Judge Tuttle granted the petition. After hearing evidence, Tuttle allowed the writ and ordered that Doodey be released from custody. The next day, Doodey filed for divorce from his wife, Mary Ann Doodey, claiming that she gave false testimony that resulted in him being institutionalized in an insane asylum. The Judge granted the divorce, but sided with Mary Ann and granted her custody of their children.",
