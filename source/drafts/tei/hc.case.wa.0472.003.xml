Isidor Lipschuetz was being examined, touching his qualifications
to act and serve as a juror in said cause. And that in answer to
the questions propounded to the said Isidor Lipschuetz as to his

and in answer to the following question; "Do you know anything that
would prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror?" he the said
juror Isidor Lipschuetz answered "Not to my knowledge." And in answe
to the following question, "Have you no such an opinion
as to require evidence to change that opinion?" the said juror answ
ered, "No, sir." Whereas in truth and in fact the said Isidor Lips-
chuetz while the jury were deliberating on the verdict of said cause,
stated to this affiant that he the said Isidor Lipschuetz was in pos-
session of facts within his own knowledge, and facts that have not 
been testified by any of the witnesses on trial of said cause

doubt that the sad petitioner, relator and defendant above named was
guilty of the crime of murder and that he should be hanged for such
offense. And affiant further deposes and says, that the said juror
Isidor Lipschuetz during the deliberation of the jury, became and
was extremely bitter and malicious in his conduct toward said peti-
tionerm relator and defendant above named, and told this affiant
that he said Isidor Lipschuetz, had made up his mind that the 
said George Webster was guilty of said offense before any testimony
in the cause had been offered, and repeatedly said to the affiant
in the jury room "I would like to see Webster taken out of the
jail right now and hung without any further trial or delay of any
kind".</p>
