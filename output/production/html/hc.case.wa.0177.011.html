WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.
NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In the matter of the Application 
of Tonka Bajlo for the Writ of 
Habeas Corpus.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">2459
No.1328</p>

      <p class="tei_p">ANSWER TO RETURN.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Comes now the petitioner Tonka Bajlo and for answer
to the return of the Hon. Ellis DeBruler, Commissioner of
Immigration at the port of Seattle, upon the issuance of
an order to show cause why a Writ of Habeas Corpus should
not be issued, and alleges as follows:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That said report is not true, correct, or accurate
in this to-wit::</p>

      <p class="tei_p">-I-<br/>
That Tonka Bajlo is reported as having testified 
to statements which she did not make at said hearing.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">-II-<br/>
That statements which she did make at such hearing 
are entirely omitted from the said report.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">-III-<br/>
That the said report fails to show that the action 
of Jack Bajlo in making his affidavit and attempting to procure
deportation of the petitioner was based wholly upon revenge,
which fact was testified to by a witness at the hearing, but
was not translated from the foreign language in which the testimony
was given and not reported.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">-IV-<br/>
That the petitioner made application for a rehearing

<span class="hr"> </span>

supported by affidavits setting forth the above facts, which
said application was refused.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">All of the above statements are supported by affidavits
which have been filed herein.</p>
