    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Claimed that Lynka Thomas was deprived of her liberty Mitchell Mark (Alias&#x2019;s include &#x201C;Glass,&#x201D; &#x201C;Green&#x201D;) and Katherine Mark. According to Anthasso, 12 year old Lynka, and was kidnapped by Mark in California from her father, John Thomas and Mary Thomas, her grandmother. Katherine and Mitchell requested that the case be dismissed on insufficient evidence. They claimed that Lynka was not 12 years of age, she was in fact 15 and had no lawfully appointed guardian in the state of Nebraska. For two years she had been a member of Mark's family and was treated in the same way as all their other children. They claimed that she came to Nebraska with them willingly, desired to stay with them, and had no knowledge of the petition filed for her. It was determined that Mary Thomas, Lynka&#x2019;s grandmother, gave her to Mark's family. Katherine and Mithchell were said to have paid $1,125 to Mary. Jonathan Anthasso and Mary Thomas offered to settle the case with Mitchell, if they paid him $3000 to no longer claim Lynka. Ultimately the judge ordered that Lynka be released from Douglas County sheriff custody and be allowed to choose either to live with the Marks or her grandmother.
