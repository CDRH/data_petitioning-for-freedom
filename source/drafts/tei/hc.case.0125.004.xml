charging said Daniel Ainsworth
and one J.S. Danford

and with intent to defraud

have violated the terms and
conditions of the said bond
or recognizance that the
said Daniel Ainsworth has
wholly failed to appear in
this court as by said bond
or recognizance required to
do, although duly called,
and that all and each of
