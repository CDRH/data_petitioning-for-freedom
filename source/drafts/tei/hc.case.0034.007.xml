<p>I am son of the witness who has 
just been examined - About 19 years 
ago my mother brought the negro 
to our house - I have known the boy 
ever since as a free boy after he should 
become 21 years <del>All that</del> I have 
lived in my fathers house here in St 
Louis ever since and all that he has 
stated in relation to the negro boy being 
in our family - is correct to my knowl-
edge - I know he was put up here 
to be sold so to pay expenses - I told sheriff 
before and at the sale that the boy

<p>(4)</p>

was free <unclear>-m</unclear> I know he is more 
than 21 yeas of age - have heard 
his mother admit to mine that the 
boy was to serve in our family 
until he became 21 years-</p>
