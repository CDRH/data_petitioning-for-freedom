<p>Province of Saskatchewan</p>

<p>THE KING vs. FLETCHER DECKER.</p>

<p>THE DEPOSITION OF FREDERICK A. McEwan, taken this 28th day of July A.D. 1921 before the under-signed Alexander Joseph Gordon MacEchen, a Justice of the Peace in and for the Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada, in the matter of Fletcher Decker who is charged upon oath for that he on or about the 15th day of November in the year of our Lord One thousand nine hundred and fifteen near Wiwa Hill Post Office in the Province of Saskatchewan aforesaid did steal about 300 bushels of flax the property of Claude Ficklin and was thereby guilty of theft.</p>

<p>Now the said Frederick A. McEwan on his oath saith as follows:</p>

<p>I am at present a special Investigator for the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Province of Saskatchewan in the Dominion of Canada, and in 1917 and 1918, I was a Detective Sergeant of the Saskatchewan Provincial Police in the said Province of Saskatchewan. In my said capacity of Detective Sergeant I made an investigation of this case. As a result of my investigation of this case, I laid information against Fletcher Decker on a charge of theft of flax, the property of Claude Ficklin, to the value of $475.00 and on the 3rd day of August, 1918, I proceeded to the premises of one, Fryer, where I interviewed Decker and I asked him if he cared to make a statement relative to this matter and he said</p>

<pb/>

<p>that he would. So I took his statement and it reads as follows:</p>

<p>"About the latter end of October, 1915, I was asked by Robert Robinson to come to his place and take a load of flax to Chaplin, Saskatchewan. I did so. I took a two deck waggon box load, about 60 buschels, Robinson hauled a load too. When we arrived near Chaplin, Robinson told me to sell the flax in the name of "Kelly". This I did. We sold the flax to a man named Helgerson of the Conger Elevator and I gave the cheque to Robert Robinson. I do not know what he did with the cheque. About Claude Ficklin's, flax all I can say is that Robert Robinson stole that flax and the above load was part of it. I cannot prove that he stole it. About the latter end of September, 1917, Claude Ficklin and Mr. Vigors, J.P., came to where I was cutting grain on the Derby place, S.E. Quarter, Section 16, Township 4, Range 5, Western of the 3rd. Meridian. Ficklin called to me and said I came for a settlement of that flax. I replied "What flax do you mean, "He said, "That flax I had stolen". I denied stealing the flax. I said I hauled one load for Robert Robinson. Well he said, "you have got to settle for the whole amount" and he gave me until ten o'clock the following morning to pay him $500.00 and if I did not do so, they would be out in the morning and get me. Then they went away and Ficklin came back again, alone, later in the day, and asked me what I was going to do and I told him that I would settle for that one load. He said he was not going to be monkeyed with, that he would go to town and bring the authorities out after me. The next morning I took a load of wheat, about 60</p>

<pb/>

<p>-3-</p>

<p>buschels, and $350.00 or $375.00 to Claude Ficklin, I paid him the money and put the grain in his granary at his place.</p>

<p>AND I make this statement voluntarily and without promise or threat held out to me to induce me to make this statement."</p>

<p>(Signed) Fletcher Decker.</p>

<p>I apprehended Fletcher Decker on the charge and brought him before Mr. Sullivan at Gravelbourg and he was admitted to bail in the sum of $2,500.</p>

<p>He the said Fletcher Decker skipped his bail and left the Province of Saskatchewan and I understand that he is at present in the United States of America.</p>

<p>(Signed) F. A. McEwan.</p>

<p>I, ALEXANDER JOSEPH GORDON MacECHEN, one of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace in and for the Provinces of Saskatchewen in the Dominion of Canada, hereby certify that the foregoing deposition was taken on oath before me at the City of Regina, Province of Saskatchewan aforesaid, and was signed by the deponent in my presence, and I declare that the offence with which FLETCHER DECKER is charged is the crime of theft as defined by the Criminal Code of Canada.</p>

<p>(Signed) A.J.G. MacEchen (seal)</p>
<p>A Justice of the Peace in and for the Province of Saskatchewan.</p>
