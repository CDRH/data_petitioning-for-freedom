<p>EXHIBIT G.</p>

<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application 
of Tonka Bajlo for the Writ of 
Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>No. 2459
1328</p>

<p>AFFIDAVIT OF JERRY BOLANCIA</p>

<p>STATE OF WASHINGTON
COUNTY OF KING ) ss.</p>

<p>Jerry Bolancia being first duly sworn on oath deposes
and states: My name is Jerry Bolancia; I reside at 810 
Charles Street, Seattle, Washington; I am employed as a
watchman with the Rainer Foundry Company, corner Stacy and East
Waterway Streets, Seattle, Washington; that I know Tonka Bajlo
and have known her for about one year; that during that time
she was employed as cook and housekeeper on 10th Avenue, Seattle,
Washington, for some Austrians; that I visited the house frequently
as I had friends living there; that on the occasions 
of my visits I frequently saw Tonka Bajlo and talked with her
and never saw anything wrong in her conduct; that I never heard
anything wrong about her character; that I knew her husband
and have heard him say in the presence of others at 810 Charles
Street, the home of Jerry Bolancia, that he had beat his wife 
frequently and that he had jumped upon her after throwing
her down and stomped her with his feet and beat her with his fists
several times while in the old country; that I heard Tonka 
Bajlo say that she would not live with him because he <add>had</add> beat
her so often and injured her health; that during the fore part
of April 1913, I heard him say to his wife that if she would 
live with him he would not beat her any more and she said that 
she did not believe him and would not live with him; that I know

<pb/>

she has been ill and to the hospital while she has been living 
at 815 Charles Street; that I heard him say he would send her
or have her sent to the old country; that I know that people
of the Austrian nationality and other old country nationalities
frequently band together and hire a house and a woman for a 
housekeeper and cook, as they find it cheaper and more satisfactory
than to live in boarding houses; that women who act as housekeepers
and cook are thought well of and no ill thoughts are entertained
towards them because of the fact that they accept such employment;
that I know a number of Austrians and any of them never say a 
bad word against Tonka Bajlo; that Tonka Bajlo told me that
she had two children in the old country; that <add>from</add> what I know of
her during the past year that she has been in Seattle, I believe 
her to be a woman of good character.</p>
