    <li>Summary of Proceedings: The three petitioners, George Walker, John San Francisco, and Pedro O&#x2019;Brien were seamen on the vessel Hattie E. Tafley, which was sailing from Hong Kong to Victoria and then to Sidney. The petitioners were underfed and the captain of the ship, George Finleyson, voluntarily deviated from the voyage plans to come to Port Blakely in Washington. The petitioners left the ship at the port and libeled the barque for their wages in the District Court of the 3rd Judicial District, but the libel failed and the seamen went on board to collect their clothing that they left on board. When they went back on board,  Finleyson placed them in chains and held them against their will. Because they were held on board when the petition was filed, the petition was filed by their next friend Jeremiah Macauley. Upon hearing the evidence, judge Roger Greene granted the writ and and commanded Finleyson to release the petitioners. </li>
