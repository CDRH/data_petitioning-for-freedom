    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Flora Ohler and Joseph Gielday divorced in January 1893. Custody of their two young daughters, Naomi and Leona Gielday, was awarded to Flora. According to Flora, she moved to Iowa and re-married, while Joseph moved to Red Willow County, Nebraska, and took ill. Flora allowed Naomi and Leona to visit Joseph in order to help take care of him. At some point, Leona returned to her mother while Naomi remained with her father. When Joseph died in February 1898, a pair of brothers named Charles and George Shafer contrived to have custody of Naomi awarded to Charles, arguing that she had no relatives living in the state. Flora petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve Naomi, which was granted. Flora argued that she was Naomi's rightful guardian and that Charles "only desires the custody of said minor child to gratify his own licentious designs and to accommodate the lust of his single brother George." Charles countered that Flora was an abusive mother, that Naomi remained with the Shafers of her own volition, and that the District Court of Lancaster County, Nebraska had no jurisdiction over Red Willow County. After hearing the evidence, fourteen-year-old Naomi Gielday was remanded to the custody of Charles Shafer.</li>
