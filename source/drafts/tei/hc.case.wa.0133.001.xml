<p>The Territory 
vs. 
S.P White } </p>
<p>Charge = murder in second degree.</p>

<p>The prisoner is charged in the 
indictment with the offence 
of murder in the seond degree,
committed by killing one <del>light</del>
Amos Light Beardon in Lincoln
County in this territory.</p>

<p>That the deceased person named 
in the indictment was <del>killed 
shot by</del> murdered by a bullet 
fired from a pistol in the hands
of the defendant and that he died
from said wound a couple of days
thereafter, is not disputed by the
defense.</p>
<p>The defense maintains the position
that the fatal shot was fired by 
the prisoner in the necessary 
defense of his person. The law
decrees to all the right to use
deadly weapons to save <del></del><add><unclear>Thinking</unclear></add>
from death or great bodily harm.
It is not every apprehended danger
 however that will justify a
killing in selfdefense. He must
be a serious danger <del>to the life</del> 
and one likely in the apprehension
of a reasonable man, <del>from the</del>to 
result in loss of life or great bodily</p>

<pb/>

<p>injury. The danger must <add>appear to</add> be
imminent and immediate,
not a contingent danger.
That he is owed not be real.
If the facts and circumstances
were such as to indulge a reasonable 
man to believe that it
actually existed.</p>
<p>A person, in no way in the wrong,
need not go out of his way to 
avoid danger, and being in a 
position adhere he has the right
to be, may stead on his rights
and rebel unlawful as soon
with such force as may be necessary.
even to the taking of human life,
if it be <unclear>worst</unclear>, to use so much
force to save his own life or to
save his person form great bodily 
harm.</p>
<p>A person, who, by his own aggression,
 brings on a difficulty
does, not plead in the cause
position. If he can he cannot
avoid a conflict, and if he
finds himself in danger and can
avoid it either by retreating or 
by calling for assistance, or by
yielding to a just demand upon
the part of <unclear>one</unclear> person or persons
attacking him, and instead of
avoiding the danger rebels is by</p>

<p>taking life, he is not justified, 
<add>on the ground of act of defense</add>
But if a person in the wrong as I 
have stated, has avoided a 
conflict by using means in his 
power and still he finds himself 
in <add>danger of his life or of</add> great bodily harm, 
and he can do nothing other
or further to save himself, then
he may use to his rights of
self defense, but with this 
<unclear></unclear>, that he must 
not have put himself in the
wrong, for the before of coming
a difficulty and giving himself
the appropriately, <del>to take the life,
of his assailant</del>after declining
as for as he cared, to take life.
The law permits the taking
 of human life only on the
ground of necessity and it
does not permit <del>of</del> <add>a</add> person to
<del>unlawfully</del> <add>designed</add> create the necessity
and there to have the benefit
of it as self defense.</p>

<p>
I think I may tell you
that the act of the defendant
in taking the revolver from
the young man <add><del>and keeping it</del></add> Frank Beardon,
<add>under the circumstances shown by the testimony on both sides </add>
<del>was</del> and keeping in was an unlawful
act and an act of offensive
<add>and prorrcating</add> as to said Frank Beardon
and his older brother, two
<unclear>jicioeed</unclear>, which named above
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
Next,
When from having the night to
kill either of them in an affayanising
and of such unlawful
act, until he had released as
for as he <unclear>camed or released</unclear> to
every other exbedient to avoid
the killing
</p>
<p>
If the defendant could have <add>dufuly</add> included
from the house by the back door,
after the assault upon him, if
there was any such assault
before the killing, he should
have done so.
</p>
<p>
If he could have, called by scaiders
to his assistance and found
himself, he should have done so. 
If he could have yielded to
the just and injustful <del>and</del>
demanding the deceased to when
the profits of the younger brother
of the deceased and thus have
avoided the necessity for a
ruling, he should have done
so.
</p>
<p>
If he determined that he could
such the manner of Frank Beardon
and that under the circumstances
he would <unclear></unclear> it, and that he
would want to any force, even to
the taking of life, to maintain
his possession of it, and that
it was with this preconceived
</p>

<pb/>
<p>2</p>

<p>
altermination that he was at the
cafe of the deceased then there
is no element of self defense
in this case no matter how just
his delual goupe may have
been.
</p>

<p>
But upon the allen heard, <del>although</del>
if he had no such preconceived
design, and there was an attack
upon him before the shooting,
which was no justice and in
believes that he could not avoid
it or retreat from it, and in
repelling such attack it was ne
causing to take life, to save his
own life, or to save himself
from great bodily harm, then
the element of his injustice wrong
could be eliminated and you
would be justified in finding <del>him
not fully</del> that the acted in self
defense,
</p>

<p>
If the Territory, has made it
a case of unlawful killing,
then the duty of getobeeiling
that such killing was in
self defense, decreas upon
the defendant.
