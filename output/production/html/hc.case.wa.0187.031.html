      <p class="tei_p">RUDKIN, District Judge. On the 24th day of July, 1913, the
Acting Secretary of Labor issued a deportation warrant reciting
that the petitioner, who landed at the port of New York on the
16th day of December, 1911, has been found in the United States
in Violation of the Act of Congress approved February 20, 1907,
as amended by the Act approved March 26, 1910, in that the
petitioner is a prostitute and has been found practising Prostitution subsequent to her entry into the United States. The
petitioner thereupon made application to this court for a writ
of habeas corpus on the grounds: first, that she was denied a
fair Hearing before the officers of the Department of Labor;
second, that she is a Citizen of the United States and the
Department was without Jurisdiction to Order her deportation;
and, third, that it appears from the testimony taken before the

Department that the petitioner is a Citizen of the United States
by reason of her marriage to a naturalized Citizen. In support
of the petition for the writ proof was offered tending to show
that the petitioner and one Benedetto Larcher intermarried in
the State of Wyoming on the 26th day of February, 1912, and that
the husband, Larcher, was then a naturalized Citizen of the
United States. The court was of opinion on the recard before
it that the petitioner was accorded a fair hearing before the

 officers of the Department of Labor, and that it could not review
	the order of the Department directing her deportatlon in view of
	the undertainty of the testimony as to the citizenship of the
	husband. The proof of marriage and of the citizenship of the
	husband was therefore rejected, the writ quashed, and the prisoner
remanded to the custody of the immigration officer. Thereafter
upon application of the Petitioner the Secretary of Labor reopened
the case for the purpose of admitting proof of the marriage of
the Petitioner and of the citizenship of her husband, but later
adhered to its former order of deportation for the reasons stated 
in the following letter:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">"The Department is in receipt of your letter dated
December 23rd, No. 425068, transmitting brief of Attorney Fred
Miller on behalf of Violet Fadanelli, alias Florence Vogel, alias
Violet Larcher, together with naturalization certificate No.
42466, issued at Carlinville, Illinois, to Benedetto Larcher and
marriage certificate dated February 26, 1912, of Benedetto Larcher
and Violet Fenanly."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"These documents apparently substantiate the testimony
given by Violet Fadanelli July 9, 1913, that while she was a
prostitute at Diamondville 'A man came to me and said let’s get
married and I thought he was just fooling and said alright and
we went to Merkener, Wyoming, and got married.’ It is also noted
that in reply to the question 'How long did you live with your
husband after your marriage?' she stated. ’We went right back to
Diamondville and the third day after I got married I was ordered
out by the police. I went to Butte, Montana, and haven’t seen
my husband since.'"</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"The Attorney General has held that where no binding
contract of marriage exists and the proceedings are in law a
nullity, it is clearly my duty to disregard the ceremony and
treat the woman as an allen. In the present oase I find no Intention on the part of the constracting parties to assume the
rights and duties incident to the marriage relation, and, further,
Violet Fadanelli was not herseif eligible to be lawfully naturalized on account of her immorality."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"The case is therefore closed, and deportation may be
proceeded with when the appeal from the findings of Judge Rudkin
has been decided."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"Please fumish Attorney Miller with a copy of this
letter. The Marriage Certificate and Certificate of Naturalisation enclosed by you are herewith returned in accordance with
your request."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I fully agree with the Attorney General that if there
was no binding contract of marriage it is the duty of the
Department of Labor to disregard matters of form and to treat
the woman as an allen. But no such case is presented here.
Surely it can not be said that a contract of marriage, solemnized

with all the formalities required by the local law, between parties
competent to contract, is a nullity and can be disregarded by the
parties or by government officers simply because the woman thought
the man was fooling when he asked her to enter into the marriage
contract, or because the parties only lived together for a period
of three days after the marriage. Every presumption is in favor
of the validity of marriage and public policy forbids that the
obligation assumed should be thus lightly regarded.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">"The statutes now commonly designate the persons who
shall have authority to celebrate marriages, including civil magistrates as well as ecclesiastics, at the same time providing that
no particular form of ceremony shall be necessary excepting the
declaration by the parties that they take each other for husband
and wife. A marriage solemnized in full conformity with the
statutes is complete without cohabitation, and its validity is
not affected by a secret intention or reservation by one of the
parties, unknown to the other, nor by their acquiescence in the
making and recording of a fraudulent certificate of marriage,
which falsely states the date or other particulars of the ceremony.”</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Nor can I agree with the conclusion that the petitioner
did not become a Citizen upon her marriage under the provisions
of Section 1994 of the Revised Statutes because of her immoral
character. In an opinion filed In Re Guignon, September 29, 1913,
I held that the marriage of an allen woman falling with the
general class described in Section 2169, to an American Citizen,
conferred citizenship upon the wife even though she did not have
or possess the qualifications of residence, good character and
other requirements of the naturalization laws, The conclusion
there reached is fully supported by the authorities and is
recognized by the Supreme Court in Low Wah Suey v. Backus, 225
U. S., 460, 473. The decision in that case was based upon the
ground that the woman was a Chinese person not born in the United
States and could not therefore be naturalized under the laws of
the United States, and not upon her immoral character. The
adoption of a different rule would leave the question of the

citizenship of an allen woman married to an American Citizen in a
perpetual state of doubt and uncertainty. If she invoked the
jurisdiction of the federal court by reason of her alienage she
might be defeated on the ground that she was an American Citizen,
and if she invoked the like Jurisdiction on the ground of Citizenship she might be defeated by reason of her alienage. She might
be permitted to vote at one election and denied the right at the
next election because of the nature of the proof offered as to
her moral character or as to the view different officers might
take of the same proof. Manifestly no such ccohdition was contemplated by Congress. I am therefore of opinion that under the
admitted facts in this case the petitioner is an American Citizen
and the Department was without Jurisdiction to Order her deportation.</p>
