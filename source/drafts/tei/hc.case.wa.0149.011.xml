IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT, FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION
OF LEE FONG FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS
CORPUS. 

PETITIONER'S BRIEF.


The Petitioner Lee Fong was arrested and detained in the
custody of the Chief of Police of the city of Seattle, upon a
charge made against him of having violated the provisions of 
Sections 6 and 7 of Ordinance 710 of the City of Seattle, approved
by the Mayor on the 6th day of February, 1886; and which is
entitled, "An Ordinance regulating the establishment and maintenance 
of Public Laundries and Public Washhouses within the 
limits of the City of Seattle". 

Said Section 6 referred to in in language as follows, towit:
"Section 6. It shall be unlawful, from and after the passage 
of this ordinance for any person or persons to establish, maintain,
or carry on a laundry within the corporate limits of the
City of Seattle, without having first obtained the consent of 
the common council, except the same be located in a building
constructed either of brick or stone and covered with a metal roof."
And so much of said Section 7 as provides for the punishment for
all violation of provisions of said Section 6, is in language
following, towit: "And any person who shall violate any of the
provisions of Section 6 of this ordinance shall be guilty of a 
misdemanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished bya
fine or not less than Five Dollars nor more than One Hundred
Dollars; or by <del>punis</del> imprisonment for not more than thirty days;
or by both said fine and imprisonment."

<pb/>

The complaint upon which the petitioner herein was arrested
and detained, charges the ofense alleged to have been 
committed in the language of said Section 6 of said Ordinance;
and that said alleged offense of the petitioner is contrary to
Ordinance No. 710, towit: Sections 6 and 7 hereinbefore quoted.
It will be observed that pursuant to the provisions of said
Section 6 of said recited ordinance, the consent of the Council
for the establishment, maintainance and carrying on of all laundries
within the corporate limits of the City of Seattle, is not 
required when said laundry is located or to be located in a 
building constructed either of brick or stone, and covered with
a metal roof. Buildings so constructed are exempt from the
requirements of said Section of said ordinance; but in the case 
of a laundry to be carried on in a frame building or other such
than is embraced in the exception to said section, the consent
of the council is demanded; and that consent is not conditioned 
upon any reference to the fitness of the building in which a proposed
laundry is to be established, for such purpose, nor upon
its protection against the dangers of fire or its satisfactory
sanatary conditions; but that such consent is dependent entirely
on the arbitrary will of council.

So that it follows, that if the person applying for such
consent is in all respects entirely worthy and deserving, and
that his building, intended for his laundry business, is possessd
of every possible sanatary provision; that all precautions and 
care
