    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On September 9th, 1921, John Tenozar was indicted on charges of breaking and entering with the intent to steal goods and chattels. A capias warrant was issued and John was arrested. He plead guilty before Judge L. B. Day and was sentenced to two years parole. Then on January 27th, 1923, the County Attorney of Douglas County filed an information in said cause, and charged John with violating the terms of his parole. On February 6th, a hearing was held regarding this charge and Judge L. B. Day revoked parole and sentenced John to no less than 8 but no more than 10 years in the state penitentiary. On August 19th, 1923, John filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the claims that his parole was wrongfully granted because the crime he was charged under was not a parolable offense and that the judge did not attach any provisions that he could have violated. Petition was granted. On August 29th, Sheriff Michael Endres responded to the petition. He denied all of the claims of John and affirmed that he was operating under the instruction of Judge L. B. Day. On September 4th, 1923, John and his lawyer motioned for a new trial for the following reasons: 1) the sentence was not in compliance with the law 2) the revocation of parole was not in compliance with the law 3) the court had no authority to grant parole and 4) the time for passing sentence had elapsed. On January 21st, 1924, the writ was dismissed for want of prosecution. The fate of John Tenozar is unknown.</li>
