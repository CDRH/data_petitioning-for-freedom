And your petitioner further states that the said Ah Chow, in whose custody and under whose control the said Seo Kim is

That your petitioner believes that he will take the said Seo Kim to Victoria and there sell her to other Chinaman as is a custom among them when their women slaves are disposed to leave them or are <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> and that he would have done so on Monday the 19h <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">inst[?]</span> had not your petitioner and several other Chinese been on the wharf to prevent him when the steamer left for Victoria on that day. Your petitioner further shows that one Ah Ying, of the said City of Seattle, has procured a license to marry the said Seo Kim, that Seo Kim is <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">desirous[?]</span> to marry Ah Ying, and for that reason Ah Chow restrains her of her liberty and will remove her from this territory to Victoria where he can and will sell her to some other Chinaman.</p>
