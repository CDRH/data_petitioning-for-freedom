<p>4. A married woman will not be accepted on the bond.</p>

<p>5. All erasures and interlineations must be noted, word for word, immediately above the signatures of the witnesses, as having been made before execution of the bond. The general statement that "erasures and interlineations were made before execution" is insufficient.</p>

<p>7. The affidavits of the signers of the bond must be taken and subscribed before an officer authorized to administer oaths generally, who must certify that he administered the oath and affix his official seal.

<p>8. A commissioner of immigration or an immigrant officer in charge must certify that the signers of the bond are good and sufficient and fully responsible to insure the payment of the entire amount of the bond. In the absence of these officials, the certificate of solvency should be signed by one of the other officials designated on page 3 of this instrument.</p>

<p>9. On and after December 1, 1917, there should be attached to the original copy of each bond the documentary stamp required by the War Revenue Act of October 3, 1917.</p>

<p>Where a premium is charged for the execution of the bond the stamp should be in a sum amounting to 1 cent for each dollar or fractional part thereof of the premium charged. Where no premium is charged for the execution of the bond a stamp in the sum of 50 cents is required. These stamps should be canceled when the bond is executed.</p>
