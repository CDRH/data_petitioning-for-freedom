    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On September 18, 1869, William W. Armstrong filed for divorce against his wife of one year, Lydia Armstrong. He alleged that she had treated him with extreme cruelty over the past summer, beating him with a stick and threatening to kill him so many times that he fled his house in fear. Lydia contested these charges, saying that she was served her divorce summons under duress and that they weren't properly authenticated or endorsed. They had a baby daughter named Mary Jane Armstrong who William wanted custody of. William also accused Lydia of "breaching the peace" by threatening to kill himself and John A. Dunn, and she was committed to the county jail, but later released on October 18, 1869. While these divorce proceedings were going on, Willam Armstrong brought Mary Jane to the house of a friend, John A. Dunn. Because of this, on October 21, 1869, Lydia filed a writ of habeas corpus against her ex-husband and Dunn, saying that her daughter was being unlawfully detained. Dunn said that he had taken in the child as an "act of humanity," and that if he hadn't, Mary Jane would have been in the custody of the courts. The outcome of this case is unknown, but Lydia and William had reconciled by 1880, and were living together in Beatrice with Mary Jane and three other siblings born after the divorce suit.</li>
