    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Gin Kato was arrested by Inspector William G. Strench for working as a cook in a prostitution house for seven months in Ketchikan, Alaska, upon a warrant issued by the Department of Labor. As a Japanese immigrant of over 35 years since legally arriving at San Francisco on 1884, with a wife in Japan, Gin Kato was charged with a bond of $500 that became $1,000 that if not paid, resulted in deportation. Gin Kato petitioned claiming that said deportation is a violation of his rights as as a lawful immigrant and resident of 35 years. He also later plead a five-year limitation on his deportation and claimed that he was unaware working for a prostitution house was illegal. His writ was denied and a deportation order was issued.</li>
