<p>IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON NORTHERN
DIVISION.</p>
<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION
OF K. GREGORY, et al.</p>
<p>No. 2646
BRIEF OF PETITIONERS.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Immigration Act of February 20, 1907 is as follows;</p>
<p>Sec. 10. That the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry, herein provided for based upon the
certificate of the examining medical officers shall be final as the the rejection of aliens
afflicted with tuberculosis, or woth a loathsome or dangerous contagious diesease, or with any
mental or physical disability which would bring such aliens within any of the classes excluded from
admission to the United States under this Act.</p>
<p>Sec. 29. of same act is as follows;</p>
<p>Sec. 29- That the Circuit and District Courts of the United States, are hereby invested with full
and concurrent jurisdiction of all causes, civil and criminal arising under the provisions of this
act.</p>
<p>An examination of Sec. 10. will show, that the decisions of teh examining board is final as to
facts which would bring such aliens within any of teh classes excluded by the statue and of course
the examining board could have no jurisdiction over any other facts. It is elementary that when the
Statute prescribes certain essential facts all other facts are excluded. In other words if these
petitioners are not excluded by the Statute they can not by lawfully excluded at all.</p>
<p>It is also elementary that the courts will take jurisdiction in all cases where the Constitution,
or the statuts are violated, and an act of Congress <add>excluding such jurisdiction</add> (if there
would be such an act) would be unconstitutional and void.</p>
<pb></pb>
<p>It is also elementary, that an act of congress conferring arbitrary power upon the examining
board, or upon any body would be unconstitutional and void. Congress itself has no such power, but
all acts of congress are subject to the Constitution; arbitrary power cannot be lawfully exercized
within the United States.</p>
<p>Justice Matthew Slate of the Supreme Court of the United States says:</p>
<p>"Any act of the legislature which confers arbitrary power is void."</p>
<p>"The laws and principles upon which our Government rests; forbid the exercise of of arbitrary
power", 
"Acts conferring arbitrary powerr do not belong to the domain of law, <add>and are always
<unclear></unclear> and void."</add></p>
<p>Yick Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356.</p>
<p>There are no lawful grounds for excluding these immigrants. If they can be excluded all
immigrants may be excluded, and the Statute nullified.</p>
<p>All actions outside of the Statute is unwarranted, arbitrary and unconstitutional, and if such
things are permitted, our government ceases to be a government <add>of</add> law and becames a 
government of men.</p>
<p>1st. It appears upon the return that there are no Statutory grounds for excluding petitioners.</p>
<p>2nd. The decision of the board is based upon grounds that are irrelevant, and immaterial, and
outside of the jurisdiction of
<pb></pb>
of the board, and unsupported by evidence, and not true, and it may be added that the assumed facts
are contrary to the knowledge of all well informed persons.</p>
<p>As for instance the Statute does not exclude "because they are farm laborers and there is no work
for them in the United States" This is absurd and foolish. it is a matter of common knowledge that
there is a scarcity of farm laborers in the United States. And of like character is the second
ground. "Because they have but a limited amount of money, insufficient to maintain them during the
winter".</p>
<p>This is an arbitrary assumtion not warranted by facts.</p>
<p>And 3rd- and 4th, grounds are the same. "Because that 800, to a 1000 Russians are unemployed in
Seattle, and thousands of other nationalities in the same conditions, and reports from the Interior
are to the same effect that the supply of common labor is far in excess of demand".</p>
<p>This is discriminating against the Russians, which is unconstitutional, and seeks to charge them
with things they are not responsible. It is also a mistake to assume that farm laborers are common
laborers. They are specialists much needed in the United States.</p>
