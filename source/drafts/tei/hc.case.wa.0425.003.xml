Territory.</p>

<p>II.
That according to the best of the <sic>knowledg</sic> and belief of this applicant the
cause or pretense of his restraint is that on the 31st day of August, 1887,
this applicant complained to John T. Mason, a Justice of the Peace in and for Mount
Vernon Precinct, Skagit County, Washington Territory, of David E. Kimble and A.B.
Corriell, charging them with threatening to strike, beat and kill your applicant and
Annie L. Tinkham, and said Justice of the Peace did on the 2nd day of September, 1887
after hearing said cause, decided that the said charge of the said William W.
Tinkham, your applicant, was unfounded and fivolous, and ordered that your applicant
pay the costs of the prosecution, taxed at $40.25, and that he stand committed until
said costs are paid, and ordered that the said Deputy Constable, Jasper Gates,
commit your applicant </p>

<p>III.
That the said imprisonment, detention, confinement and restraint are illegal,
and the illegality consists to this, to-wit: [1] that the said Justice of the
Peace had no jurisdiction to enter any judgement against your petitioner 
for costs in said action: [2] that said Justice of the Peace had no jurisdiction
to enter an order committing your petitioner; [3] that said Justice of
the Peace had no jurisdiction to issue a commitment against your petitioner in
said matter; [4] that said commitment is without authority of law, and is void;
[5] that the said costs amounting to $40.25, for which your petitioner is committed
is in excess of what should have been taxed in said matter; [6] that the legal
costs of said matter should not exceed the sume of $7.65</p>

<p>WHEREFORE your petitioner prays that a writ of HABEAS CORPUS may be granted
directed to the said Jasper Gates, commanding him to have the body of William W.
Tinkham before your Honor at a time and place therein to be specified, to do and
receive what shall then and there be considered by your Honor concerning him,
together with the time and cause of his detention, and said writ; and that he may
