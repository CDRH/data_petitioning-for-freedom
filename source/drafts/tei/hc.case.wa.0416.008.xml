<del>Doren</del> a constable of the <del>Seatle</del> <add>Tacoma</add>
Precinct in King County to T: and 
is so restrained by him the said
constable <add>Harris</add><del>Van Doren</del>at and <add>in</add> the city

custody of said constable</p>

<p>II
That the pretended cause or 
pretenses of such illegal restraints

against your petitioner

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0416.018"/>

charging or purporting to 
<del>dis</del> charge this petitioner with 
the charge of fraudulently and 
feloniously embezzing &amp; converting 
to his own use a certain sum
of money to wit $240 in money 
from one W H Harris, said 
complaint having been made by 
one W H Harris; the custody of 
this petitioner is by virtue
of a pretended warrant, purporting 
to issue from one Alex

a Justice of the Peace said 
pretended warrant being in the hands of 
the said <del>Lewis Van Doren</del> <add>W H Harris</add> constable 
as aforesaid, said Warrant 
purporting to be from Pierce 
County in this Territory</p>

<p>III
That the said restraint is 
illegal, that the said illegality
