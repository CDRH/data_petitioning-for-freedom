      <p class="tei_p">In the District Court of the 3rd Judicial
District of Washington Territory
holding terms at Seattle for
the Counties of King and Kitsap</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In the matter of the application
of George Walker, John San
Francisco and Pedro O'Brien
for a writ of Habeas Corpus

Order granting the writ</p>


      <p class="tei_p">Upon reading and filing the petition
of George Walker, John San Francisco
and Pedro O Brien, duly
signed and verified by Jeremiah
Macualy, which it appears
that George Walker John San Francisco
and Pedro O Brien, are illegally
imprisoned and restrained
of their liberty by George Fenleyson
at the Port of the Port Blakely in the
County of Kitsap in the Territory
of Washington, and stating wherein
the alleged illegality consists, from
which it appears to me that a writ
of Habeas Corpus ought to issue.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is Ordered that a writ of habeas
corpus issue out of and under
the seal of this Court, directed to
the said George Finleyson, commanding

<span class="hr"> </span>

him to have the bodies
of the said George Walker, John San
Francisco and Pedro OBrien
before me in the 2 day of
November AD 1885 at 9 oclock
AM of that day, to do and receive
what shall then and there
be considered concerning the
said George Walker, John San
Francisco and Pedro OBrien, together
with the time and cause
of their detention, and that you
then and there the said writ.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dated October 31, AD 1885<br/>
Roger S Greene<br/>
Order of the District Court
of the 3rd Judicial District
of Washington Territory holding
term at Seattle.</p>
