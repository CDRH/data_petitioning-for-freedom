In the District
Court, Fourth Judicial District
holding terms at
Spokane Falls.
The Territory of Washington
vs.
Ray Raymond
I, S.C. Hyde, being duly 
sworn on my oath do
depose and say: That I 
have read the affidavit
of T.C. Griffitts, A.F. Caton
J. Kennedy Stout, Frederick
Stanford, and Ray Raymond, 
filed herein. That
the reason why T. Donaldson
and George Wycoff were not
called as witnesses to testify 
in this action before
the committing magistrates
and Grand Jury is because
this affidavit has no knowledge 
that there were
any such persons, or
that they were present
at the killing of James
Finch, or had any information 
that they had
any knowledge concerning 
the same; and applicant
verily believes that none
of the grand jurors belonging 
to the grand jury
which found the indictment 
in this action had
any information thereof.
That applicant was first
informed that said T.
Donaldson and George
Wycoff had knowledge
of the facts and circumstances 
concerning the
killing of said James Finch
on after the finding of
the indictment herein.
That I therupon, immediately 
upon receiving such
information caused subpoenas 
to issue for
their appearance before
our said court to testify 
in this action. That
I have never had any
communication whatever
with said witnesses or with
of them prior to their
appearance at this
time of court as witnesses 
in this action.</p>
