<head>JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS.&#8212;</head>
<p>Our telegraphic dispatches contain the intelligence that Jacobs, the Oregonian before mentioned as having been recommended for Chief Justice of this Territory, and Jus. K. Kennedy, Esq., the present worthy Prosecuting Attorney of the Third Judicial District, have been confirmed as Associate Judge of Washington Territory. We presume the former will take the place of Wyche, and the latter the place of Evans, whose confirmation we published only last week. Not knowing Jacobs, we cannot say whether he is a good man or not; but we do know Wyche, and think he has held the office at least five years too long for the credit of the bench. The appointment of Mr. Kennedy is one that we can and do heartily endorse, and one that will reflect credit upon the administration.</p>
