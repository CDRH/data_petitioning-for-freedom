    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On February 3, 1923, Harry Little, a 17-year old Black teenager, was convicted of vagrancy in the police court of Douglas County, Nebraska. Judge Frank M. Dineen sentenced him to 60 days in the county jail. However, on February 9, 1923, Esther A. Johnson, the chief juvenile probation officer for Douglas County, filed a writ of habeus corpus against Omaha sheriff Michael L. Endres for Little's release. She stated that since Harry Little had already been declared a delinquent minor and was a ward of the juvenile court before his arrest, the juvenile court had complete custody over him and the police court had no jurisdiction to keep him in  jail. The case was dismissed on January 27, 1925, long after the teen's sentence had elapsed.</li>
