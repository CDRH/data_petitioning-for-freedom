    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Ichitara Matsutsuyu entered the Untied States from Japan in 1906. On June 13, 1917, Matsutsuyu was arrested on a warrant from the Secretary of Labor alleging that had become a public charge. On August 27, 1919, a hearing was held on McNeil Island in which the petitioner charges that no questions were asked about the nature of his alleged indigence and  an additional charge of smuggling Japanese boys from Mexico was added. On December 2, 1919 a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus was filed and an addendum was added on December 12, 1919. On December 18, 1919, Judge Neterer issued an opinion stating that a fair trial was given on the charge of smuggling Japanese boys. An April 12, 1920, record indicates that the writ was denied, but the fate of the bound party is unknown.</li>
