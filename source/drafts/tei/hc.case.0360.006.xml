<p>To HENRY M. WHITE, Commissioner of Immigration, Seattle, Wash.</p>

<p>WHEREAS, from proofs submitted to me, after due hearing before Immigrant Inspector Thos. M. Fisher, held at McNeil Island, Wash., I have become satisfied that the alien</p>

<p>YAICHIRO GOTO, alias YAICHIRO MATSUO,</p>

<p>who landed at the port of Nogales, Ariz., on the 6th day of May, 1919, has been found in the United States in violation of the immigration act of February 5, 1917, to wit:</p>

<p>That he has been sentenced, subsequent to the passage of said Act, to imprisonment for a term of one year or more because of conviction in this country of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after his entry into the United States; that he was a person likely to become a public charge at the time of his entry; and that he entered without inspection,</p>

<p>and may be deported in accordance therewith:</p>

<p>I, E. J. HENNING, Assistant Secretary of Labor, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the laws of the United States, do hereby command you to return the said alien to Japan, the country whence he came, at the expense of the appropriation: "Expenses of Regulating Immigration, 1921." You are directed to purchase transportation for the alien from Seattle, Wash., to his home in Japan at the lowest available rate, payable from the above-named appropriation.</p>

<p>For so doing, this shall be your sufficient warrant.</p>

<p>Witness my hand and seal this 21st day of March, 1921.</p>

<p>(Signed) E. J. Henning</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary of Labor.</p>
