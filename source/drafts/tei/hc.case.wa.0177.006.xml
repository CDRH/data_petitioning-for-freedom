<p>EXHIBIT C</p>
<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application 
of Tonka Bajlo for the Writ of
Habeas Corpus. )</p>
<p>2459
no. 1328
AFFIDAVIT OF L.G. RASHO.</p>

<p>STATE OF WASHINGTON
COUNTY OF KING ) ss.</p>

<p>L.G. Rasho being first duly sworn on oath deposes and 
says: That I am a citizen of the United States and a resident
of Seattle, <add>an Austrian by birth</add> and that I have resided here for the past 15 years;
that I am employed in the city at various occupations, and on
Monday, April 28th, 1913, Jack Bajlo, in company with Chas. H. 
Ennis, called upon Nick Radovich who conducts a lunch <add>counter</add> in the 
Frog Solo Bar at the corner of 3rd and Pike Streets, and I was
employed there at the time behind the lunch counter. That Mr. 
Ennis introduced Jack Bajlo to myself and Nick Radovich, and 
requested that Nick Radovich act as his interpreter; that at that
time said Jack Bajlo made a request to visit his wife at the
Detention Station; that several statements were made back and
forth relative to the deportation of Tonka Bajlo, wife of Jack 
Bajlo, and said Bajlo made use of the following expressions and
language in reply to questions which Nick Radovich asked him at
the instigation of Chas. H. Ennis:</p>
<p>Questions of Nick Radovich, and 
Jack Bajlo's answers to same.</p>
<p>Q. Why do you say your wife is a dirty old whore A. Because
she will not live with me.</p>
<p>Q. Is that the only reason that you say she is a dirty whore?
A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Would you call her a dirty old whore if she would live
with you? A. No.</p>

<pb/>

<p>Q. Why did you have her arrested? A. I had her arrested
and sent back home because she would not live with me.</p>
<p>Q. Then if she was willing to live with you you would not
send her back home? A. No. I do all old country 
style. Make her fear me. She know I boss.</p>
<p>I asked him who told him that his wife was sleeping
with the men where she worked and he said another Austrian, and
then I asked him who he was and he said that he did not know his 
name, and then I asked where said Austrian could be found adn 
he said he did not know. When questioned about the men, who they 
were, and where the could be found he did not seem to have anyone 
in mind at all; that he seemed to be lying and not at all sincere
about his statements that his wife was a prostitute, or that she
had been living with these men, and he said that previous to their
marriage he knew her to be a virtuous girl.</p>
<ab>L. G. Rasho</ab>
<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 2nd day of May, 1913.</p>
<ab>Chas H Ennis<lb/>
Notary Public in and for the State
of Washington, residing at Seattle.</ab>
