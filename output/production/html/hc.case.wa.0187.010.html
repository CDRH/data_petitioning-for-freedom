Department of Commerce and Labor of the United States of 
America, directing that yourpetitioner be deported the United

prostitution in such United States of America.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">No 3.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that she is restrained of 
her liberty by the said Henry M. White as such Commissioner of

in that, being an alien she was found practising prostitution
in the United States of America.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">No 4.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that she is held in custody

      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that at the hearing before 
the said C. A. Turner, Immigration Inspector, it appeared
conclusively and without contradiction that your petitioner at 
all times since her said marriage wi th the said William Grayson
has been a resident of the said United States of America
and a citizen thereof, andthat the said warrant of the Secretary 
of the Department of Commerce and Labor is invalid and of no 
force and effect in law, for the reason that yourpetitioner 
is not an alien, and has not been an alien since the institution
of such deportation proceedings.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">No 8.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">You petitioner now complains that she is unlawfully 
restrained of her liberty by the said Henry M. White under
the pretense that she has violated a law of the United States 
of America which pretense and claim is unfounded in fact as is 
to the said Henry M. White and to the Secretary of the Department
of Commerce and Labor well known.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">No 9.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner avers that in her said confinement by the 
said Henry M. White, her rights as an American citizen are
infringed and she is deprived of her liberty without any 
warrant of law, and that such restraint is illegal and invalid.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">No 10.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further avers that in the hearing before 
the officers of the Immigration Service of the United States
she was denied the right to cross examine the witnesses, to 
meet the witnesses face to face, and that your petitioner in 
such hearing before the officers of the Immigration bureau
of the United States was denied a fair and impartial hearing, and 
that there was no testimony taken before the said C. A. Turner
tending to show or which did show that your petitioner was at 
the time of the institution of such proceedings or at anytime 
subsequent to her said intermarriage with said William Grayson 
an alien to the United States of America.</p>
