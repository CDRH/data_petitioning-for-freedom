<p>United States District Court</p>
<p>Western District of Washington</p>
<p>Northern Division</p>

<p>No. 6440</p>

<p>Return</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Vincenzo Ubaldino, or Ubaldinno, alias Jose Lombardo, for a Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>To the Honorable Jeremiah Neterer, Judge of the District Court of the United States, for the Western District of Washington.</p>

<p>NOW COMES the respondent, T.W. LYNCH, Acting United StatesCommissioner of Immigration for the District of Washington with headquarters at the port of Seattle, Washington, and for answer and return to the order to show cause issued herein requiring said respondent to show cause why the writ of habeas corpus should not be granted herein, says that he here produces the body of VINCENZO UBALDINO or UBALDINNO alias JOSE LOMBARDO, the person named in the petition for said writ, in obedience to  the command and direction of said order to show cause; and for further answer and return to said order avers that he is detaining in his custody the said VINCENZO UBALDINO for deportation from the United States as an alien Italian person not entitled to admission under the laws of the United States, the said VINCEZNO UBALDINO having been heretofore arrested and detained by this respondent under a warrant of arrest issued by the Acting Secretary of Labor of the UnitedStates, and thereafter having been ordered deported by said Acting Secretary of Labor, said order to this respondent being in the following words and figures, to wit:</p>

<p>1</p>

<pb/>

<p>June 7, 1921.</p>

<p>No. 55077/58</p>
<p>Seattle</p>

<p>In re VINCENZO UBALDINO or UBALDINNO, alias JOSE LOMBARDO, aged 38, single, native of Italy, last entered the United States without inspection at Blaine, Washington, on or about March 1st.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY:</p>

<p>The record showsthat this alien was previously deported to Canada on the ground that he brought a woman into the country for an immoral purpose, etc. (see memorandum at marker in attached file). It is now shown that he re-entered the country without having secured permission to cover such entry. The alien is illiterate. He is at present serving out a fine of $150 for having nrought liquor into the country. This alien appears to have absolutely no regard for the lawsof our country, coming and going at will, although understanding his own status. The District Attorney has <add>been</add> requested to start proceedings against the alien for a violation of Section 4 of the Immigration Act. While the alien is deportable to Canada, in view of the fact that it is best to deport him to Italy.</p>

<p>The charges in the warrant that the alien has been convicted of or admits having committed a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, prior to his entry into the United States; that he was illiterate, that he entered the United States within one year of his deportation under the Immigration Act, consent to reapply for admission not having been granted; that he was a person likely to become a public charge at the time of his entry; and that he entered without inspection; having been sustained, it is accordingly recommended that the alien be deported to Italy, at Government expense, his deportation to be stayed until such time as the criminal proceedings instituted against him have been properly disposed of.</p>

<p>W.W.HUSBAND</p>

<p>Commissioner-General</p>

<p>ES</p>
<p>So ordered:</p>
