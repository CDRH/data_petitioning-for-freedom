    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On April 13, 1912, Tung Kee arrived in a U.S. port and taken into custody of the U.S. Commissioner of Immigration, set for deportation. Ben Wa filed for habeas against the commissioner, arguing that Tung Kee was a native-born resident of the U.S. and that deportation would be a denial of his constitutional rights. Wa, with attorneys, motioned for a stay of deportation, which was granted, but later cancelled on August 1, 1912 at the request of petitioner. The fate of the habeas petition and Tung Kee is unknown.</li>
