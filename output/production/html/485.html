    <li>Summary of Proceedings: William H. Martin, the petitioner, is detained due to a charge of Grand Larceny by Sheriff William Coburn and filed for a writ of Habeas Corpus arguing he is not guilty. Officer John Sexton's testimony stated that on December 1st at 3:00 am he was told to respond to a robbery in South Omaha at the boarding house of Mrs. Soash of $50.00 and a gold ring. The money was found, but not the ring and Police Judge King found Martin guilty of grand larceny. Martin claimed that no probable cause was found for either theft and files a writ of Habeas. It was then ordered by Judge Joseph Clarkson that Martin's writ be allowed. On January fourth, Martin was officially discharged from custody. In February of 1890 after the filing of a bill of exceptions Martin and his counsel, John H. Pierce are ordered to argue before the Nebraska Supreme Court, indicating that unanswered questions persisted in the case. The outcome and nature of the said argumentation before the Supreme Court are not stated. </li>
