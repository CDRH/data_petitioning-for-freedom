    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On November 18th, 1924 John Fenezia filed for and received an order for a writ of Habeas Corpus having been arrested and deprived of his liberty by Dennis Cronin and C. J. Palmer in July of that year. Fenezia was arrested and held in Hall County Jail on accounts of selling liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act. He had previously been given trial for said accounts where he was sentenced to three months on three counts and a fine of $400. In his petition it was presented that he was entitled to his freedom having been held for longer than the three months imposed as the longest period of imprisonment. The court agreed and ruled for him to be discharged. It was March of the following year that a petition for appeal was made by Cronin and Palmer. They presented that the sentence ordered the three months on the three counts to run consecutively and thus it would be a nine month sentence and that the imposed fine imposed imprisonment until it was paid. This appeal being allowed lead to a mandate order from the Circuit Court of Appeals in February 1926 to discharge the writ of Habeas Corpus and remand Fenezia to custody which was then carried out later that same month.</li>
