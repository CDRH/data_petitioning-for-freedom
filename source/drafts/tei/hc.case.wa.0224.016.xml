<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
NORTHERN DIVISION</p> 
<p>In the Matter of the Application
of LEWIS JOHNSON, for a Writ of
Habeas Corpus. } No.3077.</p> 
<p>RETURN.</p> 
<p>Comes now John M. Boyle, United States Marshal for
the Western District of Washington, and makes his return
to the petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the above
entitled cause by Winter S. Martin, Assistant United
States Attorney for the said district, and thereupon
your respondent replies, alleges and avers as follows:</p> 
<p>-I-</p> 
<p>That the respondent is without sufficient informa-
tion to make answer to the allegation of citizenship of
the said Lewis Johnson, and therefore requires the peti-
tioner to prove the same, if the said fact be material
to the issue raised herein.</p> 
<p>-II-</p>
<p>Respondent admits the second paragraph of the peti-
tion.</p> 
<p>-III-</p> 
<p>Respondent admits all the matters and things charged
in paragraph three of the petition concerning the cause
of detention of the petitioner by the respondent, except
that petitioner is held upon irregular, illegal and void
process in said cause, and as to said fact of illegal
<pb></pb> 
detention denies the same.</p> 
<p>-IV-</p> 
<p>Respondent denies the last paragraph of the the petition.</p> 
<p>AS AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE SAID RESPONDENT ALLEGES:</p> 
<p>-I-</p> 
<p>That on the 22nd day of June, A.D. 1915, John K.
Kennedy, Barrister at Law for the city of Vancouver,
in the Province of British Columbia, and Crown Prosecutor
for the said city, appeared before the Honorable John C.
Whitlock, United States Commissioner in and for the said
Western District of Washington, in the Northern Division
thereof, at Seattle, and made oath to a complaint in
affidavit form, a copy of which is attached hereto and
marked exhibit "A" of this return. That immediately
thereafter and in pursuance thereof, the said John C.
Whitlock issued his warrant of arrest for the said defend-
ant, who was then confined in the city jail in the city of
Seattle, under process which had theretofore issued by
the state of Washington, charging the defendant then and
theretofore with having brought stolen property into the
United States and into King County in said state. That
said warrant of arrest was served upon the said defendant-
petitioner, and thereafter he was brought before the said
John C. Witlock, United States Commissioner, to answer
the complaint of the said John K. Kennedy.</p> 
<p>-II-</p> 
<p>That during the hearing of the said cause before said
Commissioner, John K. Kennedy was duly sworn as a witness
and offered evidence under oath concerning his authority 
<pb></pb>
to represent the Dominion of Canada for the extradition
and return of the petitioner to Vancouver, in the Province
of British Columbia, in said Dominion, upon the charge of
larceny committed at said Vancouver, as set forth in the
complaint. That after evidence showing his authority to
represent said Dominion of Canada had been offered, there
was then introduced at said hearing depositions of certain
witnesses whose testimony had been taken before a Police
Magistrate in the city of Vancouver, which said depositions
were in due form, under oath before the said Police Magis-
trate, at said Vancouver, and thereafter duly authenticated
and visaed by the proper consular officers, all as required
by Section 5271 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States. That thereafter testimony was offered by William
McRae, Deputy Police Constable of said Vancouver, to
identify the said Lewis Johnson, then and there before the
Commissioner, as the Lewis Johnson mentioned in the depo-
sitions taken at Vancouver aforesaid. That thereupon the
demanding government rested its case, and the defendant
having then and there the opportunity to produce evidence
in his own behalf, and then and there being represented
by counsel, failed to offer any evidence to refute or con-
tradict the evidence offered by the said Dominion of Can-
ada, and thereupon the said John C. Whitlock, United States
Commissioner, found probable cause to hold the said Lewis
Johnson to await the action of the Secretary of State of
the United States, all as provided under Section 5270 of the
Revised Statutes of the United States.</p>
<p>-III-
That thereafter the evidence taken before the said</p> 
<pb></pb> 
<p>Commissioner was transcribed and typewritten, and attached
to the original depositions, duly authenticated as afore-
said, and forwarded to the Secretary of State of the United
States, under the hand and seal of the said United States
Commissioner, duly certifying to the said Secretary of
State that the said document contained all the evidence 
submitted in said cause before him. That copies of the
said United States Commissioner's certificates are hereto
attached and marked exhibits "B" and "C" of this return.</p> 
<p>-IV-</p> 
<p>That a copy of the transcript of the oral testimony
is available at this time for the purpose of this hearing, 
but the duly authenticated despositions of the witnesses in
British Columbia, concering the facts of the larceny, 
have been forwarded to the Secretary of State, at Washing-
ton, D.C., all as required by said Section 5270 of the
Revised Statutes, and unless copies of these depositions 
can be used in lieu of said originals, it will be necessary
to await the decision of the Secretary of State, if this 
Honorable Court deems it necessary to produce said original 
documents upon the hearing of this petition.</p> 
<p>-V-</p>
<p>That immediately upon finding probable cause to hold
the said Lewis Johnson, said John C. Whitlock, United
States Commissioner, issued his final mittimus remanding 
the prisoner, Lewis Johnson, to the King County Jail, to
await the action of the Secretary of State of the United 
States, all as required by said Section 5270 of the Revised
Statutes, and respondent alleges that all and singular the
proceedings in the matter of the detention of Lewis Johnson,</p>
<pb></pb> 
<p>a fugitive from justice from the city of Vancouver, charged
with an extraditable crime committed at said Vancouver,
were regular and proper, and the defendant lawfully com-
mitted to custody thereunder.</p> 
<p>WHEREFORE, your respondent having duly answered to 
said writ, prays that the same may be dismissed, and that
he have and recover his costs, fees and disbursements
herein.</p> 
<p>Winter S. Martin
Attorney for Respondent.</p>
