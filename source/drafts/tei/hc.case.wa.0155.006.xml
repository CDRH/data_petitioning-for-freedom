<p>City News</p>

<p>He Files Court's Letter</p>
<p>Nordstrom's Counsel Makes Final Effort to Save Him.</p>

<p>Not Likely to Succeed.</p>

<p>James Hamilton Lewis places Judge Hanford's personal letter to him on record
       in the federal cout, hoping it will eneable him to get into the United States Supreme
       Court - Lawyers Say Not.</p>

<p>Judge Hanford's Statement.</p>

<p>Judge Hanford himself states that he has not changed his attitude in the Nordstrom case in slightest
       particular since writing his letter of July 27 to Mr. Lewis. Said in an interview yesterday:
       "Mr. Lewis came to me this morning and asked permission to file the petition and other papers he presented
       to me some time ago, and which I returned to him with a letter explaining my reasons for refusing to issue
       any writ of habeas corpus for Nordstrom. I had never refused Mr. Lewis permission to file these papers. I therefore
       told him that he was at liberty to file them if he chose to do so; that this was a matter between himself and the clerk. I
       issued no order and have not made a stroke of the pen in the Nordstrom case since the letter I mention was written.
       The papers filed today show, moreover, that they were filed subsequent ot the writing of that letter.</p>

<p><del><unclear></unclear></del></p>

<p>"I am not however attempting to 'get behind anything' in the matter. I am willing that Mr. Lewis shall file any papers he
       may please and to let the record show anythign that is the truth. The record now shows that I have done nothing whatever
       in the Nordstrom case except to refuse to have anythign to do with it and I am satisfied to let it show that fact."</p>
