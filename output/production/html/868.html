    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Henry Imhof was charged with selling, giving, and disposing of beer to &#x201C;certain Indians&#x201D; in Sitka in the territory of Alaska. It is unclear from this case why the judicial proceedings occurred in the Territory of Washington. Imhof was put into detention and held by Louis V. Wycoff in the third territory of Washington, but the order for his arrest came from James P. Ludlow, the commissioner of the third district of Alaska. Though the original petition was sent to Roger Green in the third judicial district, Green was called away on business and the petition was heard by John Hoyt in the second judicial district. After the petition was granted, the writ was heard by Greene, who ordered that the petitioner&#x2019;s detention was illegal and that Henry Imhoff should be discharged from custody. </li>
