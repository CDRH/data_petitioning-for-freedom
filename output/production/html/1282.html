    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Grace LaVonne petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve her daughter, Virginia LaVonne, from the custody of chief probation officer Sarah Gregory, which was granted. Sarah Gregory wanted a birth certificate before the child was released, which Grace couldn't produce. In their response to the writ, Sarah's counsel requested further time to prepare their defense, which was allowed, during which time the judge determined that Grace should have temporary custody of Virginia. At the hearing, Sarah's counsel mounted no defense, and Virginia was remanded to the custody of her mother.</li>
