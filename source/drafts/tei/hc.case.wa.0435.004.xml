<body>  

<p>In the District Court of the Third Judicial District of the
Territory of Washington, holding terms at Seattle,</p>

<p>In the matter of the application of
John Bowler and Edward McCrink for
a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>Comes to T.J. Hamilton, United States Marshal for the
Territory of Washington, and in obidience to the commands of
the writ of habeas corpus hereto attached and to him directed
and delivered, makes answer thereto, and says:-</p>

<p>That as commanded by said Writ, he now has here in court
the bodies of the persons named in said writ, towit: John Bowler
and Edward McCrink, (the latter being called in said writ
by the name of Edward McCrinkle,)</p>

<p>That he has imprisoned and detained, and does now imprison
and detain the said John Bowler under and by virtue of a
certain Final Mittimus to him, said Marshal, issued and delivered
by C.D. Emery, United States Commissioner for Washington
Territory, commanding him, said Marshal, to receive the said
John Bowler, prisoner of the United States of America, into his
custody to remain in confinement until he be discharged by due
course of law; (A copy of which said final mittimus is hereto
attached, marked "Exhibit A", and made a part hereof,)</p>

<p>That he has imprisoned and detained, and does now imprison
and detain the said Edward McCrink under and by virtue of a
certain Final Mittimus to him, said marshal, issued and delivered
by C.D. Emery, United States Commissioner for Washington
Territory, commanding him, said Marshal, to receive the said
Edward McCrink, prisoner of the United States of America, into
his custody, to remain in confinement until he be discharged by
the course of law; (A copy of which said final mittimus is here
to attached, marked "Exhibit B", and made a part hereof,)</p>

<p>Following is a statement of the facts proceeding the issuing
of said commitments:-</p>

    <p>On the 20. day of June 1888, John Bowler filed with said
C.D. Emery, U.S. Commissioner, an information, of which a
copy is hereto attached, &amp; marked *Exhibit C*.
    A hearing was had on said information before said commissioner,</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>at which hearing said Bowler and McCrink each testified
under oath, that said James H. Bennett, on the 15th day of
June 1888, at the harber of San Francisco in the state of
California, did, with brass knuckles, make an assault on him said
Bowler and did beat and wound him, said Bowler with said brass
knuckles. At the conclusion of said hearing, said Commissioner
decided and held and adjudged that the alleged assault having
taken place in the harbor of San Francisco, inside the
heads, was within the jurisdiction of the State of California
and that he, said Commissioner, therefore had no jurisdiction
to hear or determine said matter. Said commissioner thereupon
dismissed said information and discharged said Bennett.</p>

<p>Thereupon informations were filed with said Commissioner
of which copes are hereto attached and marked respectively
*EXHIBIT D* and *EXHIBIT E*.</p>

<p>Hearings were had on said informations before said Commissioner,
and from the testimony adduced, said Commissioner decided
and adjudged that there was probable cause to believe
that said Bowler and McCrink each had committed wilful and
corrupt perjury in testifying as aforesaid and as charged in said
informations. Thereupon said Commissioner held each of said
persons to bail in the sum of $200. to appear at the next term
of this court to answer said charges, and they each failing to
give such bail, commitments were issued accordingly.</p>
