    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Susan M. Horn was trying to regain custody of her children from the Nebraska Children's Home Society stating that they were being kept from her, mistreated, moved around, and abused. Later in the case it comes to light that she after she was widowed, she willingly gave her children up to be taken care of and had two older children who do not have the best reputation now. She had tried to regain her children before this and could never prove that she was financially stable enough to take them on and give them a better life than they had in the society homes. The case file ends with a motion to retrial filed by Susan Horn. </li>
