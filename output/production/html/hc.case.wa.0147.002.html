WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>

OF MRS. GLADYS FREDRIKA FUSON,
FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.} </p>
      <p class="tei_p">NO. 3451.
MEMORANDUM DECISION
FILED, Nov. 2, 1916</p>

      <p class="tei_p">P. H. Wilson, For Petitioner</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Alfred H. Lundin, 
Frank P. Helsell,    For Respondent</p>

      <p class="tei_p">CUSHMAN, District Judge.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Petitioner, a minor, by her next friend, sues to be 
discharged by writ of habeas corpus, averring that, on October 
20, 1916, she was a resident of Jefferson County, Washington;
that on that date she was arrested without warrant or information 
and removed to King County, Washington, where she is imprisoned
without sentence of any competent court; that such imprisonment 
is contrary to the Constitution of the United States; that she is 
a married woman; that her husband has sued her for divorce and
that she belives she is being held to prevent her making her defense
in such suit.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By the return it is shown that on October 24, 1916, a 
petition was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington
for King County, upon a sworn complaint averring that the petitioner 
in the present proceeding was a delinquent child in need
of the care and protection of the court. The return further shows
that, on October 25, 1916, after hearing the evidence upon such

petition, the court found the petitoner in the present cause to 
be a delinquent child, living under conditions jeopardizing her
moral welfare; that her father was dead and the whereabouts of 
her mother unknown and ordering that she be, and remain a ward of 
the court in the custody of the county detention home, subject 
to the order of the court. The petition was filed in this court 
October 26, 1916 — after the making of the above order.</p>

      <p class="tei_p"> The validity of the law under which the proceeding in 
question was held is not attacked. It is Chapter 160, Laws of 
1913 (3 Rem. &amp; Bal. Code, Secs.1987-1 to 1987-18). This law was
upheld and a married girl under eighteen held to be subject to 
its provisions, in spite of her marriage, in In re Lundy (82 Wash,.
148).</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Upon the hearing the matter mainly complained of was
petitioner's arrest in Jefferson County on the oral order of a 
Judge of the State court of King County and her removal to the 
latter county,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The petitioner having theretofore been in custody as 
a ward of the King County court, discharged from such custody and
the supervision of the court upon her marriage---she still being 
under eighteen---it is not altogether certain, after her return to 
the jurisdiction of the court---even if such return was, as claimed, 
involuntary on her part, which latter fact is denied--- that that,
alone, would deprive the court of jurisdiction to make the order.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The court's process is not confined by county lines and 
if, after her discharge in full, petitioner again became a delinquent 
before going from King to Jefferson County, the want of the 
court's jurisdiction would be so gravely in doubt as to require the 
denial of the writ in any event.</p>

      <p class="tei_p"> The petition upon which the order of detention was
made avers that the delinquent is a resident of King County. As</p>

      <p class="tei_p">stated above, petitioner avers that, at the time of her arrest
she was a resident of Jefferson County, but that would present a 
question of fact for the State court to determine in passing on
its own jurisdiction.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">A writ of habeas corpus is not designed to discharge the 
same functions as a writ of prohibition.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The petition upon which the order of detention was made
further avers that, after petitioner deserted her husband, she had,
in both King and Jefferson Counties, consorted illicitly with objectionable 
companions.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Upon the hearing in this court, it was conceded that 
the order of detention made, and under which petitioner is now
held, was of a temporary character--- petitioner having asked for 
a change of Judge to try the question of her alleged delinquency,
which petition for a change of Judge has not yet been acted upon.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Under the foregoing state of the record and conceded facts,
the writ must be denied, as, in the orderly administration of justice
and in the exercise of the discretion vested in this court in 
protecting all persons in their rights under the Constitution of 
the United States, the better practice requires that a petitioner
be required to first exhaust all his, or her remedies---at least 
in cases such as the present---by appeal or writ of error in the 
ordinary course.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">to deprive a defendant whose case is governed by it of 
his liberty without due process of law, we do not feel
called upon to determine in this case, because we are
of opinion that, for other reasons, the writ of habeas
corpus was properly refused.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">"While the writ of habeas corpus is one of the remedies 
for the enforcement of the right to personal freedom, it 
will not issue, as a matter of course, and it should be 
cautiously used by the federal courts in refrence to state
prisoners.******</p>

      <p class="tei_p">"We adhere to the views expressed in that case (In re 
Wood 140 U.S., 218, 290). It is certainly the better 
practice, in cases of this kind, to put the prisoner to 
his remedy by writ of error from this court, under section 
709 of Revised Statutes, than to award him a 
writ of habeas corpus. For under proceeding by writ 
of error, the validity of the judgment against him can 
be called in question, and the federal court left in a 
position to correct the wrong, if any, done the petitioner, 
and at the same time leave the state authorities in 
a position to deal with him thereafter, within the limits 
of proper authority, instead of discharging him by habeas 
corpus proceedings, and thereby depriving the State of 
the opportunity of asserting further jurisdiction over
his person in respect to the crime with which he is charged.
(at pp. 75, 77, &amp; 78)</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The rule is discharged and petitioner remanded to the 
custody of the county detention home of King County, subject to 
the order by which she was therein held at the time the first 
order herein was made.</p>
