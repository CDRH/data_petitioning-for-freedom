    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Ichitaro was ordered for arrest and deportation on the account that he was a Japanese laborer in the U.S. without a passport, and taken into the immigration detention center in Seattle. He petitioned for habeas, claiming that he was illegally restrained and said law which is the grounds for his warrant did not apply to him because there was no law requiring a passport from someone coming directly from Japan to the U.S. He added that as a seaman, he was entitled to enter and remain in the U.S. until he took another ship.
On March 21st, 1922m Ichitaro escaped from the detention center and from the custody of Weedin, becoming a fugitive.
