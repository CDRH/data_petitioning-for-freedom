    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Thomas P. Overnell and Nancy Overnell, the parents of Thomas Nelson Overnell (a 14-month-old child), got into a custody dispute in October 1862. On October 23, Frances Miller (Nancy's brother) testified as a witness and stated that Mr. Overnell and Ms. Overnell were at his father&#x2019;s house and barn when the custody dispute occurred. Frances told the Justice of the Peace that he witnessed Mr. Overnell take Thomas and that, &#x201C;judging from his condition&#x201D;, he believed Ms. Overnell should have custody. Mary Bozarth also testified and stated that Mr. Overnell should not have custody of Thomas. On October 27, Caleb N. Miller (Nancy's brother) petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Thomas. He stated that Mr. Overnell forcefully took Thomas out of Ms. Overnell's custody. The couple was separated at the time and Caleb stated that Mr. Overnell threatened to take Thomas out of the county. On October 28, Judge Hewitt ordered the sheriff to arrest Thomas N. and either bring him to the court himself or to Ms. Overnell so that she could bring him. The sheriff placed Thomas into Nancy's custody. On October 30, the judge ruled that Mr. Overnell admitted &#x201C;that the mother is for the time being the more proper and suitable party to have custody&#x201D; and decided that Ms. Overnell should have custody of Thomas.</li>
