    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Bell has been held by Sheriff McDonald for over a week, the cause of his detention is unknown to him. Petitioner Henry Bell is, thus, asking for a writ of habeas corpus to be issued on the grounds of unlawful imprisonment (deprivation of liberty). The writ was filed and granted on 2 April 1898. Judge Slabaugh ordered that Bell be returned on 4 April 1898, directing that order to Sheriff McDonald. A copy of the writ was officially filed with the Sheriff on 2 April 1898. A document was entered to the record stating that Henry Bell should be kept in custody for further examination as he had been charged with drunkenness on 26 March 1898; this record was signed and ordered by Police Judge Samuel I. Gordon. 

Bell appeared in court on 4 April 1898 and Judge Slambaugh signed an order releasing him on that same day stating, &#x201C;it is therefore ordered that said Henry Bell be discharged from the custody of John McDonald Sheriff and from said unlawful detention."

On 17 May 1898, a motion was filed by Ablyn L. Frank (Clerk for the District Court) asking that the costs be taxed to Douglas County and paid out of the County Treasury. The motion was sustained and the County was ordered to pay the sum. </li>
