    <li>Summary of Proceedings: F. Vetter was a tailor who lived in Walla Walla, Washington. He was born in Prussia, and was married to another immigrant, Lina Vetter. He was described as a "quiet, industrious man." They had two children, Minnie, born in 1860, and Susannah, born in 1864. A saloon keeper in Walla Walla named Eugene Crowne would visit the house frequently. However, over time, Mr. Vetter became suspicious of his friend's relationship with Lina and forbade him from visiting the house. Eugene continued visiting Lina while Mr. Vetter was away, and eventually, on May 27, 1869, the two ran away together, taking Minnie and Susannah with them. Mr. Vetter immediately filed for a writ of habeas corpus for Susannah, and sheriff James McAuliff caught the family in Wallula, Washington on a boat headed to Oregon. Crowne filed a motion for dismissal on May 31, 1869, but it was denied. On June 1, 1869, judge Joseph E. Wyche determined that the children should stay with the Sisters of Charity in Walla Walla until the divorce suit that Mr. Vetter initiated in the beginning of June was completed. Crowne was a serial philanderer, and Judge Wyche expressed contempt for him, saying that 
"no jury in the country would convict the slayer of the destroyer [of the family].&#x201D; Crowne was to face a later trial for his adultery. Eugene and Lina got married in Walla Walla in September 1869, and the 1870 census reveals that Minnie and Lena were still in the custody of the Sisters of Charity.</li>
