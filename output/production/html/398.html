    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Sam Gum petitioned for habeas after being detained by Immigrant Commissioner Henry M. White on the accusation that he was an illegal immigrant with bonds of $1,000. Sam Gum argued that his deportation and his hearing was unfair and illegal, that he had lived in the United States for many years, and added that he had already had a hearing with a William G. Strench in Ketchikan, Alaska, addressing his work as a cook for a prostitution house. On July 14, 1921, Sam Gum was granted temporary leave of jurisdiction in order to provide his family money in Alaska which they were owed. He then died on March 10, 1922, and his petition was dismissed.</li>
