    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In October of 1921 Harry Dragoun petitioned for and was given an order allowing for a writ of Habeas Corpus having claimed he was being unlawfully deprived of his liberty by sheriff Micheal L. Clark after being arrested for a second time. It was June 1921 when Dragoun was arrested and charged with reckless driving of an automobile upon which he was tried for and discharged. Then in October of the same year, Dragoun was arrested again and charged with seriously maiming and disfiguring while exceeding the speed limit. In his petition he argued that the second arrest was based upon the same facts and circumstances that the first arrest was made on and thus was put twice in jeopardy for the same offense contrary to Constitution of the State of Nebraska Article I section12. Sheriff Clark, in his response, presented that he held Dragoun in custody by virtue of a warrant by a police magistrate. It was January 1924 that the writ was dismissed for want of prosecution. The fate of Dragoun is unknown.</li>
