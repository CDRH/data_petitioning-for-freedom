<body>  

<p>Territory of Washington } S.S.
County of Spokane</p>

<p>In the matter of the application
of Samuel O'Brien for a

<p>To the Honorable

Justice of the Supreme Court
of Washington Territory</p>

<p>Your petitioner

and <unclear></unclear> to your

of eight-years of age.
That your petitioner

in the state of Nebraska
and is entitled to the
care custody and control
of said infant Harry
O'Brien. That on or
about the 2nd day of
February AD 1888 during
petitioners temporary
absence from his house
one Nancy OBrien took</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>said infant Harry
OBrien from the home
of petitioner and conveyed
him to the Territory
of Dakota where she
secrited said child
and from there she
brought him to this
Territory where she now
secrited him and
prevents your petitioner
from having the care
custody, or control of
said infant. What
your petitioner is informed
and believes
the said Nancy OBrien
now has the said
infant Harry OBrien
secrited at or near
Crescent Park in Lincoln
County in this Territory
and refuses to
allow your petitioner
to have the care custody
and control of said
infant Harry OBrien
to which by law he is
entitled. That your
petitioner has reason
to believe and does 
believe that the said</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Nancy OBrien will take
the said infant Harry
OBrien out of the jurisdiction
of the Courts of
this Territory unless 
authority is given to the officer
executing the writ
in this matter, to take
the said infant Harry
OBrien with his custody
and presents his body
before your honor.</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner
prays that a writ of habeas
corpus may be granted
directed to the said Nancy OBrien
commanding her to have
the body of said infant
Harry OBrien before your
Honor at the time and place
therein specified to do
and receive what shall
then and there be considered
by your honor concerning
said Harry OBrien; together
with the time and cause
of this detention. And that
upon the hearing of said
matter your honor will
make an order testimony
said infant to the care
custody and control</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>of your petitioner. Said
for such other orders or
relief as to your honor
may seem right and lawful
in the premises</p>
