<p>Ter of Washington</p>
<p>Walla Walla County</p>
<p>In District Court for the First Judicial District of Washington Ter. Before the Hon. J. R. Lewis Judge At chambers</p>

<p>Charles Gahres &amp; Martha J Gahres Guardians of Etta Dora Cravens, a minor Plffts<lb/>
vs.<lb/>
W. H. Barret and Isabella Baret Defts</p>

<p>Plaintiffs complaining of Defendants for cause of action allege:</p>

<p>1 That the above named Plaintiff, Martha J. Gahres (formaly Martha J. Cravens) <unclear>is the mother</unclear> of the said minor child, Etta Dora Cravens by a former marriage with one W.H. Cravens and that she is the natural and lawful guardian of the said minor child, and entitled to the custody and control of the same</p>

<p>2 That the said Martha J. Ghares formally Martha J. Cravens as aforesaid retained a judgement of service from her former husband W.H. Cravens of a regular term of the circuit court of the state of Oregon for the county of Union 

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.018.002"/>

began and held on the first day of November AD 1869 in which suit the said Court Justice ordered and decreed that the said Martha J. Gahres then Martha J. Cravens have the custody and education of the said Etta Dora Cravens.</p>

<p>3 That at said Divorce suit the parties <unclear></unclear> and the said Etta Dora Cravens was within the jurisdiction of the said court. </p>

<p>4 That since the said decree of divorce the Plaintiffs herein have lawfully married and are now living together as husband and wife.</p>

<p>5 That plaintiffs have ample means for the education of the said Etta Dora Cravens and that the Plaintiff Martha J. Gahres the mother of the said minor child, has ample means for that purpose in her own right.</p>

<p>6 That the said Etta Dora Cravens is now seven years of age and that as the plaintiff <unclear></unclear> her education has been wholly neglected</p>

<p>7 That the said Etta Dora Cravens is wrongfully and unlawfully withheld from the custody of Plaintiff, at Wallula in the County of Walla Walla and Territory

<pb facs="hc.case.wa.0004.018.003"/>

of Washington by Defendants, WH Barret &amp; Isabella Barret.</p>

<p>8 What the course of the said illegal restraint and detention of the said minor child, to the best of their knowledge and belief of Plaintiffs is an alleged gift of the said Etta Dora Cravens to defendants, Isabella Barret by the said Martha J Cravens, now Martha J. Gahres, before the decree of divorce aforesaid from her former husband W. H. Cravens and that the illegality of the said restraint &amp; detention considering this that the said alleged gift is totally without foundation and purely a fiction of Defendants.</p>

<p>Therefore Plaintiffs pray that a writ of Habeas Corpus may issue directed to the Defendants W.H. Barret &amp; Isabella Barret commanding them to have the body of the said Etta Dora Cravens before the Hon. Judge of this Court, at a time and place designated by said Judge and then and there to do as <unclear></unclear> what the said Hon. Judge shall consider in the premise concerning said minor child and that they show cause why the said minor child is witheld from the care and custody of Plaintiff and for costs in this proceeding.</p>
