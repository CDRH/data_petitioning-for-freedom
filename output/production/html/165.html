    <li>Summary of Proceedings: George H Place attempted to regain custody of his children, Zella V. Place and Howard D. Place from Mary A. and Charles E. Dake. Place alleged that the Dakes were not educating his children, moving them from place to place, and having disreputable moral character. Place said that he was married and could provide Zella and Howard an education and take them to church. The writ was allowed, but we do not know the outcome of the children's custody. 
Another point: George H. Place seems to have also been the attorney for in a child custody case later that year- Susan M. Horn. </li>
