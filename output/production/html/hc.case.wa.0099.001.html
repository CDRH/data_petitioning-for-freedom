      <p class="tei_p">In the District Court, of the Second Judicial District, holding terms at Tacoma, Washington Territory.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">2395</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In the Matter of the Application of Ah Sing. For a Writ of Habeas Corpus. Petition for Writ.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Hon. Frank Allyn, Judge of the District Court of 
the Second Judicial District, Territory of Washington.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The petition of Gee Hee respectfully shows:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That the said Ah Sing, is unlawfully imprisoned, detained, 
confined and restrained of his liberty by T. J. Hamilton, 
United States Marshal for the Territoy of Washington, at the 
United States Prison on McNeils Island, Pierce County, 
Territory of Washington.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That the said imprisonment, detention, confinement and 
restraint are illegal; and that the illegality thereof consists 
in this, to-wit:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That the said Ah Sing is imprisoned for the alleged illegality 
of coming into the United States of America, contrary 
to section one (1), of " An act to amend an act entitled " An 
act to execute certain treaty stipulations relating to Chinese 
approved May sixth eighteen hundred and eighty-eight." passed 
by the forty-eighth Congress and approved by the President on 
July fifth eighteen hundred and eighty-four. But the said 
Gee Hee says: that Ah Sing was a resident of the United States 
of America, at the time of his arrest, and had been a resident 
for many years prior thereto, all of which he verily believes 
he can prove.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Wherefore, your petitioner prays that a writ of Habeas 
Corpus may be granted, directed to the said T. J. Hamilton, 
Marshal as aforesaid, commanding him to have the body of said 
Ah Sing before your Honor at a time and place therein to be 
specified, to do and receive what shall then and there be 
considered by your Honor, concerning said Ah Sing, together with 
the time and cause of his detention, and said writ; and that 
he, the said Ah Sing, may be restored to his liberty.</p>
