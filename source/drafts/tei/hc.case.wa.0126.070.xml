of December held upon the remains of
A.L. Beardon the following sworn testimony was taken viz:</p>

<p>O.J. Rogers being sworn made the following 
statement viz:</p>
 
<p>On Sunday the 21st Inst. I was at the store
of Portch Bros at Sherman W.T. there was
present at the time Light, Frank and Henry
Beardon, R.C. Welch Howard E. Portch
and Bud White. Four of them were playing
cards and as I stepped to the store Bud
White stepped aside and got into the middle
of the floor and he then asked Frank Beardon
when did you get in? Frank answered a 
few days ago. q by Bud <del/> are you 
going to pay me for that revolver you 
got of me answer by Frank yes when 
I get the money I have not got it now
Bud - you agreed to pay me in 30 days
and you did not do it you then wanted
30 days more and I let you have it out
instead of paying me you went on a spree
at the cost, have you got the revolver with 
you? F. No
</p>

<p>
Bud- Where is it? Answer I left it below
" Have you any other? " I have
" Let me see it: Frank then gave him a
large revolver when Bud said I guess this
will do.

<pb/>


will do in place off the other it was I think a
Colt revolver. Light then stepped up and
said what in the Hell are you trying to
get through you Bud. Bud answered what are 
you trying to get through you. Light then got
between Bud and the door and said Bud you
are not going to take any advantage of the Boy
meaning Frank give him back his revolver
and I will see that you are paid for it
Henry also said the same to Bud then there
was considerable swearing by all of them
Light again said give him back his Revolver
and I will stand good for it Bud said 
no I wont do it Light said he would not
take it out of the door they again commenced
to call each other names Bud then stepped
into the middle of the floor away from
Henry and stood facing Light Light shook his
fist at Bud I saw Bud draw his revolver
and said to Light of you dont back off
I'll shoot you. I believe Light stepped toward
 Bud and then I heard the revolver go
off Questions by the Jury Bud said he had seen
him over long enough but would not have 
it any longer. They where tusslin after 
the shooting. Bud Light Henry Frank
Light doing the most of it then they
were trying to take the Revolver from
Bud
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
one of them said shoot him and another said
cut him I saw Frank go up to him and with
a knife saying god dam him cut him
all to pieces. I saw Bud with his head to the
counter Bud said he would take it all back
to let him up I then heard Light say Boys 
I am shot. Light then said I wish I had killed
him he then started to go out of the store.
Frank came out with a revolver in his 
hand saying shoot the son of a bitch and
run down towards Shermans before he got to 
Shermans Henry got Bud into the house
In the beginning and before the shooting Bud 
had the only revolver.</p>

<p>E. A. Portch being duly sworn made the 
following statement. I was in the store at 
the time of the shooting Bud ask Frank 
when he had come back and Frank told 
him about 2 weeks ago. He ask him when
he was going to pay for the revolver that he
had bought off him and Frank said as soon
as he got the money. Have you got a 
revolver with you? Yes. Let me see it 
and then Frank gave it to Bud who said 
that will fit the bill and I guess I will 
keep it. Frank said you need not get 
on your ear about it I'll pay you for
your revolver. Light then said give the
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
Revolver back to him. Bud said he would 
not do it <del>P</del> Light said I will stand good
for the $9.00. Henry also ask Bud to give 
Back the revolver saying he would also 
go searching for the $9.00. Bud stepped back
saying if you run over me I'll shoot you
and the next time I heard a shot.
Frank stepped back into the corner and pulled
out his pocket knife I'll cut him all to 
pieces. question by the jury <del>Bud</del> <add>Light</add> did not 
take a hold of <del>Light</del> <add>Bud</add> until after the
shot was fired. Frank had a small 
pocket knife it was a common pocket 
knife. Light grabbed a hold of the revolver
I think Light was trying to defend himself
by Bud I mean Bud White by Light
Light Beardon also Frank Henry 
Beardon.</p>

<p>H.S. Beardon being unduly sworn made the 
following statement</p>

<p>The row commenced as follows. Bud White ask 
Frank when he had got back. Frank said about 
two weeks ago Bud ask Frank when he intended
 to pay him the money he owed him on a Revolver
 Frank said I have been sick all month
and unable to work and could not raise any 
money and will pay you as soon as I can,
Bud ask have you got the revolver away then.
</p>

<pb/>

<p>
Frank said he had Bud ask to look at it
Frank gave it to him when Bud said I guess
this will settle it Light then got up and
said give him back his revolver and I'll
see that is paid. I also said the same to
Bud telling that we would make it all right
He put his hand into his right hand pocket
and the revolver he took from Frank into the 
left. He then turned his head towards me
and told me to step back. Light stepped 
toward him Bud jumped up right when
Frank had said stand back. Light stepped
towards him about 3 steps Bud then shot. I 
jumped on to Bud I wanted to take the revolver
away from him and get him Bud out of doors
I then took Bud to Sherman's house</p>

<p>Question by the jury I did not notice Light
attempt to strike him I saw no knife used</p>

<p>Frank Beardon being duly sworn made
the following statement viz</p>

<p>The first of the quarell was this way 
Light said we dont want any trouble
about this revolver Bud give it back to 
him and I will make it all right Henry 
also said that they would make it good
Bud said god dam you I dont want 
any thing out you Light said give the pistol back
and we will settle this like men ought
to settle any thing. Bud pulled out his


<pb/>


Pistol making motions towards <del>Bud</del> Light 
and at the second motion (describing the
motions) he fired at Light I went to take
the pistol away Henry he stepped in between
 Light and Bud Henry and Light also tried
to take Pistol away from Bud I saw he was 
trying to get the other revolver out of his pocket
when I struck him on the head before he threw
the last revolver I had a knife open and in 
trying to take the revolver away, the knife 
went into his hip at the same time I drew the
revolver away from him, Henry then took Bud
out and took him down to Sherman's</p>
