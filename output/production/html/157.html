    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On 11 July 1912, Patty McFadon and his attorney, C. L. Hover, submitted this petition which stated that McFadon was being unlawfully deprived of his liberty by Sheriff Felix J. McShane under &#xA7; 242 of the Criminal Code of the State of Nebraska. The petition stated that this section was invalid because it was not properly passed by the legislature. It is unclear what exactly this section criminalized as the text is not included in the Case File. Presumably, the proposed section would have criminalized vagrancy; as McFadon was charged with &#x201C;vagrancy,&#x201D; and was sentenced to a term of 10 days in county jail. This sentence was issued and signed by Charles E. Foster, the Omaha Police Magistrate, on 8 July 1912.On 11 July 1912, Judge A. L. Sutton of the Douglas County District Court ordered that the writ be allowed, returnable to Sheriff McShane and set a hearing before Judge Charles Leslie for that same day. The Sheriff&#x2019;s return, which was filed on 15 July 1912, stated that he brought McFadon before Judge Leslie as commanded.</li>
