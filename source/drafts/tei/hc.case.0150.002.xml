<p>The examination of Ray Raymond
for shooting and killing Jud. Finch
in a brothel on Front street last
week, continued throughout Tues-
day, Wednesday and Thursday of
this week before Judges Peel and
Booge and the Judges pronounced
sentence Friday. It was a long and
exhaustive examination. Thos. C. 
Griffitts, one of the most tenacious
criminal lawyers in eastern Wash-
ington, conducted the defense, as-
sisted by his partners Gen. Bane
and J. Kennedy Stout, while the
territory was represented by District
Attorney Hyde, who brought all of
his great reserve force to bear on
the case. Quite a number of wit-
nesses were called and they were 
put through the most trying exami-
nation. Every scintilla of evidence
that couldbe collected on the sub-
ject was drawn out and it has been
a trying ordeal to the witnesses.
The case was argued Thursday, Mr.
Griffitts in his appeal for his client
made an exhaustive and able argu-
ment that lingered long upon that
part of the testimony that favored
the prisoner. He occupied some
time in going over the ground, 
citing cases bearing on the points
he desired to make and ending
with a strong appeal upon the justi-
fibleness of the act. Mr. Hyde met
the masterly play of his opponent at
every point and closed the argu-
ment Thursday night with a general
summing up of the evidence. The
judges witheld their decision until
the next day at 10 o'clock. During
all of the trial a large crowd
was attracted by the usual
morbid curiosity that drew upon
to the court room on such
occasions. The room was crowded 
almost to suffucation, and the atmos-
phere that the judges, the attorneys
and the audience were compelled to
breathe was ladened with a poison
very apparent to the olfactory nerves
of those who stepped into the room
from the outside, and the effect 
made itself felt upon those who
were compelled to sit in the room
throughout the day. At the hour
appointed for rendering their ver-
dict the court room was again
crowded. When the attorneys and
prisoner were present Judge Peel
stated, in the usual form, that they
had considered the case on the testi-
mony presented, and held the
prisoner on the charge od murder in
the first degree. Upon hearing the
decision the crowd, is very bad
taste, expressed satisfaction by
stampling. The demonstration, to-
gether with the decision, fell with a
faded weight upon the unfortunate
fallen woman, and she broke down
for the first time during the long and
painful strain, and wept bitterly.
After the decision, the prisoner was
taken to her room, where she has
been confined since the shooting,
where she completely collapsed, and
spent the time since weeping pit-
eously. She was taken to Cheney
yesterday afternoon. Her attorney
will apply for a writ of habeas corpus
before Judge Turner, as soon as that
gentleman returns from Olympia.

Yesterday morning Judge Turner
rendered his decision in the case of
Ray Raymond for the killing of
Jas. Finch, granting bail in the sum
of $5,000, which the prisoner will
probably give. Judge Turner based
his decision solely upon the testi
mony bearing upon the act, stating
that murder in the first degree re-
quired proof that the crime was
premeditated and committed from
malice aforethought. He would not
decide the grade of the crime, but
put the amount of bail at the figures
above given.Considerable dissatis-
faction has been expressed upon the
result of the examination and the 
admission of the prisoner to bail.
We have not heard that any inti-
mation has been made that Judge 
Turner was in any manner government
in his decision by outside pressure,
nor would we believe any such non-
sense if we had. We believe Judge 
Turner to be a man while on the
bench sitting in judgement upon the
life or liberty of a fellow man out of
the reach surrounding influences.
No one who is acquainted with the
man will Impugn his motives. He 
is to render judgemnt upon th testi-
mony offered before him. He is not
moved by sympathy to temper
Justice, nor he is wearing the
ermine for the purpose of punishing
enemies. We believe him to be a 
judge as upright as he is wise, and
that he had moral courage to decide
a case upon the merits of the evi-
dence. In the case in question, with
the same evidence before him, we
are satisfied that he would have 
never faltered in rendering the
same decision had there been a
thousand men present, everyone of
whom were shouting against such a 
verdict. The crime for which the
woman is held is a fearful one. It
was an unnecessary sacrifice of life.
The full circumstance surrounding
the deed, however, is only known to
the chief actor in the tragedt. Her ad-
missions have been given, it remains
with a jury to decide whether the
provocations were sufficient to Justi-
fy the deed, if not they are to give
in a verdict. However, since the
farcical trial of the Indian for shoot-
ing Officer Rusk, we have little 
respect for the decision of a Spokane
jury. If the enormity of this crime
is punished in the same ratio as that
of the one committed by the Indian,
the Raymond woman will probably
get clear on the grounds of excusable
accident. But this is speaking
lightly of a serious affair. The fact
of admission to bail does not fix the
status of the crime, and it will
remain with the trial before the fall
term of the court to decide the nature of
the verdict and the full extent of
her punishment.

THERE will be some who will use
the disgraceful shooting affair of yes-
terday morning as an argument for
prohibition. Without pity for the 
unfortunatevictim they will twist
his death for his own prupose. We 
believe the affair would have hap-
pened if this had been a prohibition
town, and the saloons are no more 
responsible than is the man who in-
vented or manufactured the weapon
with which the deed was done.

Further Partitioner of the Meeting of
James Finch
In our yesterday's issue we made
a brief report of the shooting of a 
man names James Finch by a 
woman of the town named Ray
Raymond. Very little more is
known of the case than was briefly
reported. Coroner Penfield sum-
moned a jury yesterday morn-
ing and the jury brought in a ver-
dict that the man came to his death
from a gunshot wound from a pistol
in the hands of Ray Raymond.
Officer Gillepsie, who was the first to
reach the scene, made the following 
statement to us: He was standing
at the California house when he
heard the pistol shot. He ran
diagonally across the street to the
First National bank building and
from there could see into the open
door of the brick house at the cor-
ner of Front and Mill streets. He 
saw the arm of a man who seemed
to be lying down waving and saw a
woman standing over him crying or
waving her hands. He ran to the
house. A man was lying cramped
up in a small entrance at the door
breathing heavily, while the woman,
Raymond, seemed to be badly
frightened. She said she had shot
the man. Dr. Morgan was at once
summoned and a crowd upon col-
lected, for the report of the shoot-
ing spread rapidly. Ray Raymond
at the inquest in substance stated
that she was attracted to the door
by some one opening it. She met the
man and ordered hi to leave
he refused to go, and upon her in-
sisting, he struck at her. She then
got her revolver, and returning to
the hall again ordered him to leave.
He refused and struck  her on the
shoulder, when she pulled up the
pistol and it went off with fatal re-
sults. She claims that she had no
intention of shooting. When the 
man exclaimed that he was show, she
dropped the pistol and did what she
could to assist him. When she real-
ized the efforts of the shot she faint-
ed, and has been confined to the bed
with hysteria ever since. The ex-
amination was set for 1 o'clock yes-
terday afternoon, but on account of
the condition of the prisoner it was
postponed to 7 o'clock P.M.  and she
still being unable to appear, it was
further postponed to Tues-
day morning. It was learned
that the dead man's name was Jas.
Finch, and not Fitch, as at first re-
ported. We are informed that he
has a wife and two or three children
at home. Her crime up to this
place some six months ago with a 
companies who clapped at Marshall,
while Finch engaged in cutting tir-
enst of hers. Friday morning the
two met and drank considerable
during the day. His friend wanted
Finch to go to bed early in the even-
ing, but he insisted on making a
night of it. He was undoubtedly
full when he was shot, as he was
without a bat and by himself. The
woman had not been drinkinh. The
shooting was the general Spokane
conversation yesterday on the
streets; but it did not create any
excitement. The woman is under
medical treatment and also under
guard.
