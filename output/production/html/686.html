    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In December 1903, W. L. Lafferty, an employee of the Kansas City-based L. B. Price Mercantile Company, was fined $50 for violating a Fremont, Nebraska city ordinance against peddling samples without first paying a fee to the city treasurer. When he did not pay, he was confined to the Dodge County jail. Lafferty petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, arguing that his right to conduct interstate commerce had been violated. The City of Fremont responded that Lafferty erred in filing in federal court since he had not exhausted his remedies in state court, namely appeal. After hearing the evidence, Lafferty was remanded to the custody of his jailer.</li>
