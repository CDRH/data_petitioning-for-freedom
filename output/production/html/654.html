    <li>Summary of Proceedings: C. V. Storz and a second petitioner with the surname Storz claimed they were unlawfully arrested with no legal warrant and had not committed larceny or a felony. Their attorney demanded to know the nature of the charges and be admitted to bail. However, their jailers claimed that they were not accused of any offense and therefore not to be brought in court to meet with their attorney or allowed bail. Their writ was approved, but Storzes were not released from custody because their lawyer only filed habeas for them to obtain counsel and not to be released.
