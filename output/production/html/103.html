    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Christ Evers of West Butte, Oregon filed a writ of habeas corpus to gain custody of his son, Fred Evers from Fred Zeek. Zeek said that he has a family and that for more than a year, Fred Evers has made his home with and resided with Zeek and his family. Fred Zeek's wife was Fred Evers's deceased mother's sister. Christ was deaf, and according to the Omaha Daily Bee, "has lost to a considerable extent the use of his language." Zeek alleged that Christ Evers is not a fit or suitable person to have the care and custody of Fred Evers, that he was without means, had no home, and was a man of dissolute habits. The application of Christ Evers was denied and the petition was dismissed. The judge stated that Fred should stay in the Zeek home as his aunt was the closest thing to a mother he had after Menine Evers's death, but that Fred Zeek should work the boy less and allow him to go to school more.</li>
