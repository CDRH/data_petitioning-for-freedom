      <p class="tei_p">This is to certify that I received the within writ of Deportation on the 14th day of June 1889, commanding me to take On Ding, Ah Sing, Ah Sam No 2, Ah Lam, Wa Kim, Lee Pin, Gin Cheong, Wong Fong, Wong Boy, Ah Ching No. 1, Ah Ching No. 2, Han Goon, Ah Jin No. 1, Ah Jin No. 2, Ah Gong, Won Ga, and Suey Wee, and deport them to British Columbia the Country from whence they came. In obedience to said writ I took the above named Chinamen to Victoria B.C. the place from whence they came, and then and there showed the within writ of Deportation to the Custom House officials of Victoria who refused to allow the said Chinamen to land without the payment of $50.00 each as head tax, or a certificate entitling them to leave and return to the Province of British Columbia. As the said Chinamen had no certificates entitling them to return to that country and as I had no money or authority from the U. S. Government to pay the per capita demanded I was compelled to return the said Chinamen and await the further order of this court.</p>
