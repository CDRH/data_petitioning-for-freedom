      <p class="tei_p">Territory of Washington vs James Riley}</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Defendant by counsel moves the Court to quash the Indictment herein for the following reasons</p>

      <p class="tei_p">1st It appears from the fact of the indictment 
that the grand jury which found 
and returned said indictment into open 
court had no cognizance of the offence 
charged</p>

      <p class="tei_p">2nd That the court into which said 
indictment was returned has no 
jurisdiction of the cause.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">3d It does not appear upon the fact 
of the indictment that the grand jury which 
found and returned the same was a 
legal grand jury authorized by law to 
inquire into the offence charged</p>

      <p class="tei_p">4th It appears from the record that no legal 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">venue[?]</span> issued for summoning the grand jury 
which found and returned said 
indictment. And for other reasons apparent upon the 
fact of the record</p>
