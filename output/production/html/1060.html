    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On August 23rd, 1919, William Braniff was tried and charged in Omaha's police court for the offense of assault and battery. He was subsequently arrested, though the complaint for his arrest contained almost no details about the nature of his crime or who the victim was. Braniff took his case to court and filed for a writ of Habeas Corpus. He showed that he was being held based on a complaint that was defective, insufficient, and void of a timeframe for when the crime was allegedly committed. Judge Estelle heard his case and granted Braniff a writ of Habeas Corpus, ordering Sheriff Michael L. Clark to release him from custody. </li>
