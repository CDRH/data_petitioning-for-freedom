    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Frances Anzalone, the bound party, is the wife of Sebastino Anzalone and the daughter of Joe Valendi. However, her status as a minor and first cousin to Sebastino Anzalone led to her forceful removal from her home to the Riverview Detention Home for Juveniles. This arrest was made under the claim that she was bound to an illegal marriage for her age and consanguinity with Anzalone. The petitioners argued that in Italian culture, it is normal for young girls to be married at her age and that the couple is only related as half-blood first cousins. Additionally, the marriage was consensual and had the approval of Valendi, the wife's father. According to the appearance docket, the case was dismissed for want of prosecution. </li>
