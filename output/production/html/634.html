    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Tom Weber was an immigrant from Austria, having arrived in the United States in 1912. In 1916 Weber joined the IWW, a union organization. On January 4th, 1918, Tom Weber was arrested under a warrant issued by the U.S. Secretary of Labor, William B. Wilson, and was held for multiple months while his case was pending. The charges alleged were that he was an alien, he advocated for and taught the unlawful destruction of property, and that upon entering the country he was a likely public charge. On December 2nd, 1918, a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus was filed stating among other things that he did not know English and thus did not read IWW literature, was never a beggar, did not want to destroy property, and that a transcript of his hearing was never given to him. The fate of the petition and the bound party are unknown.</li>
