<p>In the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington,</p>
<p>Northern Division.</p>

<p>No. 5943</p>
<p>Affidavit Supporting Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of YAICHIRO GOTO, otherwise known as YAICHIRO MATSUO, For Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>State of Washington</p>
<p>County of King</p>

<p>SS.</p>

<p>E. P. Donnelly, being first duly sworn on oath, deposes and says: That he is an attorney at law, duly sicensed to practice his profession, and actually practicing his profession in the City of Seattle, Washington.</p>

<p>That during the month of February, 1921 affiant was present at a purported hearing held by an inspector at McNeil's Island, Washington as counsel for the petitioner hereing That affiant was apprised of said hearing on the day before the same took place, and at the time of said hearing was in ignorance as to the facts of the case, and was only familiar with the record; that at said hearing the record of the former hearing before an inspector in Los Angeles, California was introduced in evidence, at which former hearing the petitioner herein was denied a right to counsel, and was forced to answer statements against interest, and against his wishes, and at which former hearing he was forced to submit to examination before an interpreter whom he could not understand, as stated by the petitioner under oath; that at the purported hearing at McNeils Island other unidentified exhibits were introduced in evidence against the petitioner</p>

<pb/>

<p>herein; that code telegrams were introduced in evidence, the meaning of which was unknown to the petitioner herein, and that the record submitted to Washington,D.C. consisted of the record of the former hearing in Los Angeles, California; that at said hearing is appears from the record, petitioner was forced to answer questions against his will, and the whole case was rested upon cross-examination of the petitioner, he then being unrepresented by counsel; that although several charges were made against petitioner no competent evidence was submitted in support thereof. That petitioner is totally unfamiliar with the English language, and was absolutely ignorant of the questions supposed to have been asked him in Los Angeles, and that despite the protests of this affiant a further hearing or any hearing on the merits before a competent interpreter was denied affiant.</p>

<p>That affiant was denied the right of counsel and the right to a full and fair hearing on the merits, and is about to be deported to the Empire of Japan. That petitioner is not a public charge, and is not likely to become a public charge. That affiant was forced to submit the record to the Secretary of Labor at Washington, D. C. without opportunity of investigating the case whatsoever, and that under the circumstances, the petitioner has been denied his constitutional right of a full and fair hearing.</p>

<p>E P Donnely</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 30th day of March 1921.</p>

<p>D. A. Keeman</p>
