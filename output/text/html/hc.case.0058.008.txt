In the Probate Court of Jefferson County Wash Terry

In re the Guardianship of Nellie Moulton and Rosie Moulton Minors

Territory of Washington County of Jefferson } ss

James Eaves  being duly sworn on oath says that Nellie Moulton aged 11 years and Rosie
Moulton 10 year old have no legally appointed guardian.

That they have no mother living that their father Robert Moulton is a hard drinking
man and to that extent that he is wholly incompetent to have the care custody

1

or  of said minors. That for the last two years said minors have lived with affiant
and are with him now and are and will be as long as they  there properly cared for.

That said father threatens to take said children from affiant and remove them elsewhere.

That he has no house or place to take them to and it is necessary that a guardian
should be appointed to look after and take charge of them at once

That they have no property. That the father has no means to take care of them

2

nor is he a fit or competent person to have their care or custody

Wherefore affiant prays that a guardian be appointed for said children at once and
that affiant have an order of this court to keep them in his custody  for the present
and temporarily until the further order of the court.
