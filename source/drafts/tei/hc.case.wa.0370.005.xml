That he remained continuously in the United States until the 3d day of November, 1921, when he was taken into custody upon a warrant for deportation by the Department of Labor at Cosmopolis, Washington.</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>That a hearing was had upon the departmental warrant for</p>

That under said warrant of deportation, unless restrained by this Honorable Court, your petitioner will be placed on board ship November 26, 1921, and will be by said Commissioner of Immigration and his deputies unlawfully deported to Japan.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p>That in all respects his arrest, detention and imprisonment is illegal and without warrant or authority.</p>
