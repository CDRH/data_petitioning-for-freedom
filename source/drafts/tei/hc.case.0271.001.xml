<p>No. 1376. In the Circuit Court of the United States</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Joseph Walton, for a writ of Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>Petition</p>

<p>Filed in the U.S. Circuit Court, Western District of Washington</p>
<p>Jan 10 1906, A. Reees Ayres, Clerk</p>
<p>A. N. Moore, Dep.</p>

<p>Cutts and Dorety
       Attorneys for Petitioner.</p>

<pb/>

<p>In the Circuit Court of the United States, In and For The Western District of Washington</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of Joseph Walton for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. Petition.</p>

<p>To the Honorable Circuit Court of the United States, in and for the Western District of Washington</p>

<p>Your petitioner, Joseph Walton, respectfully represents and shows to this Honorable Court, that he is
a citizen of the United States, and a resident of the City of Seattle, State of Washington; that he is
a barber by trade, and that he derives his income and living from carrying on the business of barbering
in said City; that he is unjustly and unlawfully restrained of his liberty, and detained and imprisoned
in the County jail of King County, State of Washington, by L.C. Smith, Sheriff of said County, by virtue
of a pretended warrant of arrest, a copy of which is hereto annexed, marked "Exhibit A".</p>

<p>Your petitioner further shows that said warrant was issued by P.V. Davis, Justice of the Peace, in and
for Seattle Precinct, in said County, acting under and by virtue of a certain supposed Act of the Legislature
of the State of Washington, entitled "An Act to Prohibit the Carrying on of the Business of Barbering on Sunday,
and Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof", approved March 7th, 1903.</p>

<pb/>

<p>Your petitioner further shows, that the act for which he was arrested and is now held in custody, was the shaving
of a certain guest of the Tourist Hotel in said City, in the room of said guest in said hotel, upon Sunday, January 2nd, 1906;</p>

<p>First, Because the Act of which your petitioner is accused in said warrant, is not an illegal act;</p>

<p>Second, Because said pretended Act of the Legislature of the State of Washington is contrary to the provisions of the Four-
teenth Amendment to the Constition of the United States, in that it deprives your petitioner of liberty and property without
due process of law, and that it deprives your petitioner of the equal protection of the laws.</p>

<p>Third, Because said Justice of the Peace has not and never has had any jurissdiction to issue a warrant of arrest for the act
named in said warrant.</p>

<p>Wherefore, to be relieved of said unlawful detention and imprisonment, your petitioner prays that a Writ of Habeas Corpus to be
directed to the said L.C. Smith, may issue in this behalf, so that your petitioenr may forthwith be brought before this Honorable
Court, to do, submit to, and receive what the law may direct, and that pending a hearing upon this application, your petitioner may be
admitted to bail by this Court.</p>

<p>Joseph Walton. Petitioner.</p>

<p>Cutts and Dorety. Attorneys for Petitioner.</p>
