    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On October 11, 1920, Stella Taylor purchased and drank beer in the company of Robert Johnson. She was arrested by a police officer and charged with vagrancy and prostitution. On October 14, 1920, she filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with her attorney Noah W. Ware. In the petition, Stella Taylor provided the address of her home and stated that she had been married to W. M. Taylor, with whom she had a four-year-old child, for 12 years. She also mentioned her husband&#x2019;s employer, Armour&#x2019;s &amp; Co. The writ was allowed and delivered to the respondents. On October 19, 1920, the respondent, Marshall Eberstein, replied to the writ stating that Stella Taylor was ordered to pay a fine of $50 by Oct. 13, 1920, and was arrested and jailed under Charles E. Foster after not paying the fine. She was then transferred to the Omaha City Detention Home by order of the police court judge and the Omaha Health Commissioner where she was subjected to forced physical examinations to ascertain if she had contracted a venereal disease. They determined she was afflicted with a venereal disease and the judge denied the hearing for the writ based on those results. The court then remanded her to the custody of the respondents.</li>
