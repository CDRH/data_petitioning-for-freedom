      <p class="tei_p">George F. Schor being first 
duly sworn on oath states I am a citizen
of Spokane County, Washington Territory
and I now do, for several weeks last
past I have resided at Spokane Falls
in said county, but prior thereto for
more than two years I resided in
Cheney in said County, and I was residing 
at Cheney in said county at the
time of the alleged killing of the named
herein in June 1886 I <del>have many
times</del> am the editor and publisher 
of the Northwest Tribune a weekly
newspaper published in said county, I 
at the time of such killing or immediately
following the same and many times
since I have heard many different
statements of what purported to be the
facts in the case among and

<span class="hr"> </span>

by the people of Spokane County, and I 
have heard many expressions
of bitter prejudice against deft
among the inhabitants of the county
and almost universal expression
of <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">better[?]</span> belief in her guilt and 
a desire to see her punished
whether guilty or not. From conversations 
I have had with and
listened to among the inhabitants
of Spokane County I believe this
defendant cannot have a fair
trial in this county of Spokane
owing to the excitement and
prejudice of the inhabitants and
people of the county against
her.</p>
