<p>Hugh C. Todd.</p>
<p>IN THE DISTRICT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR WESTERN
DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>In the Matter of the Application of
CHIN WAH HING
For a Writ of Habeas Corpus.} No. 3378
PETITION FOR
WRIT OF HABEAS
CORPUS.</p>
<p>To the honorable Jeremiah Neterer, District Judge:</p>
<p>Comes now, Chin Wah Hing, petitioner, and petitions
this Court to issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus to inquire into the
cause of the detention of one Chin Doe Tung by Hon. Henry M. White
Commissioner of Immigration, at Seattle, Washington, and shows
to the Court as follows:</p>
<p>I.
That Chin Doe tung is the lawful blood son of your
petitioner, eighteen years of age, and is now detained at the
at the United States Immigration Station at Seattle, Washington,
by Hon. Henry M. White, Commissioner of Immigration at Seattle,
in the proceedings from the application of the said Chin Doe Tung
to be admitted into the United States as the minor son of your
petitioner who is a recognized legitimate merchant within the
meaning of the laws of the United States and the treaties
between the United States and China governing the admission
of the subjects of China into the United States, being a member 
of the Kee Fong Company, 667 King Street, Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p>II.
That the said Chin Doe Tung is imprisoned and restrained
of his liberty by the said Commissioner of Immigration at<pb/>
said Immigration Station; that he has not been committed and is
not detained by virtue of any judgement, decree, final order or
process issued by a Court or Judge of the United States, in a case
where such courts or judge have exclusive jurisdiction under
the laws of the UNited States, or have acquired exclusive
jurisdiction by commencement of legal proceedings in such a court
nor is he detained by virtue of the final judgement or decree of
a court or competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction,
or the final order of such a tribunal made in the special
proceedings instituted for any cause except to punish him for
contmept; or by virtue of an execution or other process issues
upon such a judgement, decree or final order; or by virtue of a 
warrant issued from any court upon an indictment or information.</p>
<p>III.
That the court or pretense of the imprisonment or
restraint of the said Chin Doe Tung, according to the best
knowledge and beleif of your petitioner, that the said Commissioner
ruled that the said Chin Doe Tung was an alien Chinese person,
not a member of any of the exempt classes of Chinese entitled
to come into or remain in the United States, and accordingly
refused him admission, from which finding an appeal was taken
to the Secretary of Labor and said appeal was thereupon denied
by the Secretary of Labor on the __ day of June, 1916; that
the decision of the said officials denying admission is upon
the ground and for the reason that the said Chin Doe Tung was
married before coming to the United States and has a wife in 
China, which ruling is illegal, wrongful, contrary to the 
laws of the United States and the Government
of China respecting and governing the admission and exclusion<pb/>
of the subjects of China into and from the United States.</p>
<p>IV.
That the facts developed by the hearings in this
matter by said Immigration officials are insufficient to
justify the decision that the said Chin Doe Tung is not of the 
said exempt classes and the said decision is arbitrary, and also 
contrary to law; that the said immigration officials in making
said findings, aside fromo being contrary to law and treaty,
greatly abused their discretion in holding that the said
Chin Doe Tung was not ofthe exempt classes. </p>
<p>V.
That the said Chin Doe Tung is being restrained of his
liberty without due process of law, in violation of the provisions
of the constitution of the United States, the laws and treaties
governing such cases made and provided; that he is wrongfully, 
illegally and arbitarily restrained of his liberty, and that
the said Immigration officials are about to deport him and that
unless this Court intervenes he will be deported forthwith.</p>
<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays that a Writ of Habeas 
Corpus may issue, directed to Hon. Henry M. White, Commissioner
of Immigration at Seattle, Washington, commanding him to have
the body of the said Chin Doe Tung before Hon. Jeremiah Neterer,
Judge of the United States District Court, Western District of 
Washington, Northern Division, at the Federal Court Building
in Seattle. Washington, at 10 o'clock A.M. July __, 1916,
to do and receive what shall then and there be considered
concerning the said Chin Doe Tung, togetjer withh the time and
cause of his detention.</p>
<p>Dated June __, 1916.
Chin Wah Hing
Petitioner.</p>
