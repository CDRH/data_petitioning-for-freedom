      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable Law Commissioners Court 
of St. Louis County</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Petition of Mary Wilson states that she is 
now unlawfully restrained of her liberty and actually 
confined in the Jail of St Louis County in the city of 
St Louis, that she is imprisoned by James Castello 
the Jailor of said County: That she was arrested 
on the oath of one John J. Schuler and committed 
to Jail by Louis Du Breuil, a Justice of the Peace of 
said County a copy of which affidavit &amp; commitment is herewith filed, as a runaway slave: That she is not 
a runaway slave, but is a free person of color, and 
as such has been residing in the City of St Louis &amp; 
State of Missouri for the term of about five years: 
that said Schuler demanded of her, the petitioner 
a fee for services professed to be rendered to a man named
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> Wilson, which said Schuler alleged 
your Petitioner promised to pay him; but this your 
petitioner denies, as said Schuler <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">defended[?]</span> said 
Wilson into the Work House, and because your 
Petitioner refused to pay him this unrighteous fee 
he through motives of malice and revenge made 
out this affidavit</p>

      <p class="tei_p">and your petitioner notes that said imprisonment is illegal in that the affidavit aforesaid <del/> does not state 
matter sufficient to justify in <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">court[?]</span> for life imprisonment that said affidavit is informal &amp; void. that 
said Warrant of Commitment is insufficient informal 

and void:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hence therefore she prays that <del>you</del> this Honorable 
Court will consider her case &amp; discharge her from imprisonment</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Mary Wilson by</p>
      <p class="tei_p">C.C. Carroll for her</p>
