    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Edward L. Dodder filed a petition to acquire the custody of Ruthie Ewart from his sister, Mrs. Dodder, who intended to take Ruthie to California, where she lived asn an invalid. This was after her ex-husband and Ruthie's father, J.S. Ewart, kidnapped Ruthie on February 2, 1902, while she was on her way to dinner at her grandfather's house. The girl was understandably alarmed at first, but was happy to realize that she was with her father. A writ was also served to J.S. Ewart, but since a writ couldn't be served on a Sunday, court authorities had to wait until after midnight to serve him the writ. The judge denied the writ, and Mrs. Dodder was allowed to take Ruthie on a temporary visit due to her illness. However, she ultimately ended up in the custody of her grandmother, Mrs. Ruth Dodder.</li>
