<p>That after an alleged pretended hearing your petitioner was ordered deported under departmental warrant of deportation dated September 25th, 1920, and is now in custody of Henry M. White, United States Immigration Commissioner at the Port of Seattle, Washington, in this district, for the purpose of being deported to Japan on the 27th day of October, 1920.</p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p>(a) That your petitioner continuously resided in the United States for thirty-five (35) years prior to his arrest.</p>

<pb/>

<p>(b) That said proposed deportation of your petitioner is an invasion and a violation of the rights of your petitioner under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Emperor of Japan, of whom your petitioner is a subject, dated November 22nd, 1894, and proclaimed by the United States of America March 21, 1895.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE, Your petitioner prays that a writ of habeas corpus may be issued to the Honorable Henry M. White, United States Immigration Commissioner at the Port of Seattle, commanding him to produce the body of your petitioner before this Honorable Court, there to submit to and receive whatever the court shall order in the premises.</p>
