<p>United States District Court for the Western District of Washington
In the matter of the
application of John Matthews    } No. 6203

<p>Comes now the above named petitioner by George F. Vanderveer,
his attorney, and alleges as follows:</p>

<p>I.
That at all the times hereinafter mentioned Henry M. White
was United States Commisioner of Immigration for the District of
Washington, having his headquarters in the city of Seattle, State of
Washington.</p>

<p>II.
That at all the times hereinafter mentioned your petitioner
was and still is a citizen of Ukrainia and that more than thirteen years
ago he emigrated from Ukrainia to the Dominion of Canada, thence to the
United States of America, where in the year 1920 he was convicted of
a violation of the United States postal law relating to the mailing
of obscene pictures and was sentenced to imprisonment in the United
States penintentiary at McNeil's Island.</p>

<p>III.
That thereafter, and in consequence of your petitioner's
conviction as aforessaid, the United States of America, acting by its
Secretary of Labor, instituted proceedings against your petitioner to secure
his deportation from the United States Immigration statutes and on the
19th day of February, 1921, after a due hearing it was determined by said
Secretary of Labor for the United States that your petitioner had been
born in and was a citizen of Ukrania aforesaid and should be deported
thence under the provisions of the immigration statutes above referred to.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>That ever since said date your petitioner has been and still is unlawfully
and unreasonably restained of his liberty in the County jail of King
County by Henry M. White, Commissioner of Immigration aforesaid, under
the pretended authority of said warrant or order of deportation and that
said restraint is unreasonable and unlawful in this: that the government
of the United States, as your deponent is informed and believes, has no
diplomatic relations with the government of Ukrania and is unable to
deport your petitioner to said Ukrania and is making no attempt to do so and
has no intention of so doing, and that unless the said Henry M. White,
Commissioner of Immigration aforesaid, is prevented from so doing he
will continue unlafully and unreasonably to retain your petitioner
of his liberty and confine him as a prisoner in the County jail of King
County aforesaid, all in violation of your petitioner's right under
the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE your petitioner prays an order directing the Clerk
of this Court to issue under its seal a writ of habeas corpus directed
at Henry M. White, Commissioner of Immigration, requiring him to produce
the body of your petitioner in the above entitled court at such time
as the Court may fix and then and there show cause, if any he has,
why your petitioner should be further restrained of his liberty.</p>
