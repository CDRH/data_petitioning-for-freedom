    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Peter Williamson Merta, the bound party, entered the United States from Finland to work as a logger in 1903. IN 1917 he joined the IWW, a union organization, and served as the Secretary of the organization in Raymond, Washington. On March 1st, 1918, the bound party was arrested on a warrant issued by the Secretary of Labor, William B. Wilson (unnamed in the petition). The bound party was charged with being an alien, advocating or teaching the destruction of property, and being likely to become a public charge. On April 30th, 1918, Thomas M. Fisher, immigration inspector, interrogated the bound party on these issues and found the charges to be substantiated. The attorney for the petitioner does not agree that the questions were relevant. On December 9, 1918, a writ of Habeas Corpus was filed. On December 13th, 1918, the Secretary of Labor issued another warrant authorizing the deportation of the bound party. It is also mentioned that he is suspecting in supporting certain anarchic beliefs such as the violent overthrow of government, disbelief in organized government, and unlawful killing of US officers. On December 16th, 1918, Judge Jeremiah Neterer let the writ issue and ordered a heating for the 30th of December. On February 5th, 1919, Judge Neterer denied the writ due to its similarity to two previously adjudicated cases, In re Samuel H. Dixon and In re Charles Bernat. The bound party was returned to the custody of the Commissioner.</li>
