<p>No. 5449</p>
<p>Reply Brief of Petitioner.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Petition of Taka Shibata for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>The two cases cited by counsel for the government do not support the contention of the respondent. The case in 59 Fed. in fact sustains the position of the petitioner. It holds in effect that a marriage legal where entered into is legal everywhere. The court expresses doubt as to the proof of the marriage but nevertheless admits the petitioner as the wife of a domicile Chinaman. Counsel for the government fall back upon the contention that there is no legal proof of the marriage and no proof of its legality in Japan. It is respectfully contended that the government is estopped from raising this question. The petitioner was admitted to the country and landed as the wife of the husband. By that action the Immigraion authorities had admitted the legality of the marriage and we submit that they cannot blow hot and cold. The ptitioner was admitted to the country upon a passport as the wife of her husband. It must be presumed that the Department of State or Foreign Affairs of Japan understood the effect of the marriage and we contend that by the issuance of such passport the Department of Foreign Affairs virtually and in effect certified to the regularity and legality of the marriage and that this supplies the proof, if any be needed of the fact and legality of the marriage.</p>

<p>In addition to this we desire to urge upon the court that which is common knowledge, namely, that hundreds, if not thousands, of similar marriages have been recognized by the United States Immigration authorities and the wives admitted to this country whose marriage rests upon the same basis as that</p>

<pb/>

<p>of the petitioner. It is too late for the United States to now questions the legality of the marriage.</p>

<p>The finding that the petitioner is likely become a public charge is the merest pretense. The petitioner could resort to proceedings for separate maintainance under the laws of this state regardless of the period of her residence here. It is to be presumed that similar laws exist in all the states of the Union. But even if the petitioner could not in the event of misfortune claim support from her husband she certainly could claim support from her brother under Section 8375 of Remington Ballinger's Codes.</p>

<p>In addition to this petitioner's brother has offered to give a bond to guarantee that the petitioner shall not become a public charge and the evidence in the case shows that he is financially responsible.</p>

<p>There must be substantial evidence to show that she was liable to become a public charge at the time of her entrance. A mere conjecture or visionary or immaginary reason not supported by the evidence is not sufficient to authorize her deportation.</p>

<p>Ex Parte Mitchell, 256 Fed. 229.</p>

<pb/>

<p>The arbitrary character of the action of the Department is illustrated by this incident. When counsel appearing before petitioner before the Immigration officials referred to an affidavit sworn to by the husband, which is returned here, he was assured by the officials that such affidavit had not been considered and had not been forwarded to the Secretary on appeal. We now find it included here as a part of the record. It certainly would not be made a part of the return had it not been before the Secretary.</p>

<p>There was no opportunity to cross-examine as to the statements made in this affidavit and they are totally different from the statements made by him on the witness stand. This should be a clear demonstration of the arbitrary nature of the alleged hearing and we urge that he demonstrates that the petitioner did not have a fair and open hearing.</p>

<p>Furthermore the record shows that the hearing was entered upon without affording the petitioner any opportunity to employ counsel and after the testimony was taken she was then informed that she could employ counsel and afforded an opportunity.</p>

<pb/>

<p>The evidence in the case shows that the marriage was registered in Japan under the customs and laws of that country and as already stated in the United States Department of Immigration has recognized the legality of these marriages in a great number of cases and are now estopped by their actions in this case from questioning the validity thereof.</p>

<p>Marriage is a universal right and a marriage contracted in one place under the law of nations is valid throughout Christiandom. The physical presence of both the contracting parties within the same jurisdiction is not necessary to give a marriage contract validity. Every presumption should be in favor of upholding marriage contract. By the international law of marriage which ought to govern the courts a marriage valid <del>it would be valid elsewhere</del> although it would be invalid elsewhere should be good everywhere and it becomes the duty of every tribunal expounding the law of marriage "to proceed as though it were a court of the collective nations presiding over the marriages of the civilized world; and as the judiciary of a particular state administering the general law of the state, will not hold a transaction valid in one country and void in another, so such court of the collective nations would not interpret the international law of marriage in a way to render a part of the marriagesvalid in one country and void in another. And there was never suggested any rule which would work a uniformity of result except this <add>of the</add> lex loci contractus."</p>

<p>"Where a Kentucky statute prohibited intermarriages within a degree of consanguinity too remote to conflict with the law of nations, and a pair of Kentucky people, whom it rendered incompetent, went into Tennessee and there intermarried, no like provision forbidding in Tennessee, the Kentucky Court held it to be good in Kentucky; observing, by Marshall, C. J.: "As the prohibitory law of Kentucky would have had no force in Tenessee, the marriage in the latter State must there have created the lawful relation or status of marriage, by which the parties were in law and in fact lawful husband and lawful wife to each other in the state of Tennessee, so soon as the marriage was performed, and continued to be, so long as they remained, and would have been so if at any time before an actual divorce they had returned to that</p>

<pb/>

<p>State. And so if immediately after the marriage they had gone through the other states, and even to Europe, intending all the time to return to Kentucky they would have been lawful husband and wife in every place, at least in every country where the common law prevails; because it is a part of that law that, being lawful husband and wife at the place of marriage, they continue to be so wherever they maybe". Therefore, since matrimony was a part of the law of nations, this individual marriage could not be otherwise than good in Kentucky. A contrary decision, rendering it void in Kentucky while valid in all the rest of the world, would have taken Kentucky marriages out of the law of nations, and made them a mere domestic institution, peculiar to the one State.</p>

<p>Bishop on Marriage, Divorce &amp; Separation.</p>
<p>Vol. 1, Section 845 (page 361)</p>

<p>For a very learned and exhausted discussion of the doctrine just referred to we respectfully call the court's attention to the volume last above cited, Sections 833 to 847 (pages 356, 362.)</p>

<p>Respectfully submitted.</p>
