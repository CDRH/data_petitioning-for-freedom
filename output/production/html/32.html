    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On June 18, 1920 Vito Cheala was arrested in Omaha on charges of suspicious character, with no complaint filed against him and no trial or hearing to follow. As a result, Frank Palo filed a petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus on Cheala's behalf. The respondents alleged that on October 30, 1919, the grand jury found Joe Klieeg, also known as Vito Cheala and Willie Kali, guilty on the felony charge of stealing an automobile and receiving a stolen automobile and a warrant was issued for his arrest on June 4, 1920. The respondents alleged that they arrested Cheala on June 18 with the intent to deliver him to the Douglas County sheriff due to this warrant. The court found that Cheala was not unlawfully detained and ordered him to be recommitted to the custody of the respondents.</li>
