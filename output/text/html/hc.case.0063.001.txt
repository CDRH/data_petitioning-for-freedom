In the District Court for the Third Judicial District of the Territory of Washington,
holding Terms at Seattle in and for the Counties of King Kitsap &amp; Snohomish:

To the Honorable George Jacobs Judge of said Court:

The petition of the Ah Ham &amp; Ah Gorg  an  inhabitants and residents of Seattle in
said District respectfully represents, that Ah Sing and Ah Yoel are unlawfully restrained
of their liberty in the County Jail of King County aforeseaid.

The cause or pretense of said restraint is that they, the said prisoners are charged
with owing 14.50 taxes to the city of Seattle.

Your petitioners alleges the said imprisonment to be illegal because no such tax has
ever been assessed against said prisoners and because the City Marshall, by whom they
were imprisoned had no warrant or legal authority to collect such tax:

Wherefore your petitioners prays that a writ of Habeas Corpus issue and that such
prisoners be brought up and discharged.

Ah Ham
Ah Gong his mark
