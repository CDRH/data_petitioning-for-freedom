    <li>Summary of Proceedings: William Mullins resided in Kansas City, Missouri and said he provided his children a good home after the children&#x2019;s mother had died. On October 7th, 1908, the children ran away from said home and came to South Omaha in Douglas County where they were kept by Ella T. Mullins who was the mother of the step children and the wife of William. William argued that Ella was not entitled to the children and that she took them into her possession and unlawfully restrained them from their liberty. Ella returned them to William wherein he placed them in the custody of Mrs. Cramer who owned a boarding house. When one of the children objected, he struck Charles with his umbrella and knocked him down. The children, William and Charles, were required to sleep in the same room with a son of the boarding house keeper by the name of Elmer Cramer, who was between the ages of 17 and 18. Elmer took Charles to a house of prostitution and then also took off his clothes and exposed himself to the Mullins children. Elmer also &#x201C;practiced a vicious and loathsome vice in their presence and on several occasions attempted to instruct Charles in said practice.&#x201D; William E. Mullins also refused to send Charles to school and advised said son that he would rather have him grow up big, strong, and healthy than to be an educated fool.&#x201D; The father also called the son a "green eyed liar" and "little bastard." Ella alleged that when she married William E. Mullins took the children, Florence, William, and Charles, into her home and loved them. She owned a hotel in South Omaha called the Delmonico Hotel and she said that William and their children resided there until he left them and took Florence to live with a family member and left the two boys. Four years later, William requested the children and they were returned to him and then three months later they left to their own volition back to Omaha. The last documented happening of the case was the response from Ella to William and the fate of the children is unknown. However, 1910 census records indicate that an 11-year-old named Willie Mullins was living with Ella in South Omaha.</li>
