<p>Province of Saskatchewan</p>

<p>THE KING vs. FLETCHER DECKER.</p>

<p>THE DEPOSITION OF WILLYAM JAMES HENRY VIGORS, taken this 25th day of July A.D. 1921 before the undersigned Alexander Joseph Gordon MacEchen, a Justice of the Peace in and for the Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada, in the matter of Fletcher Decker who is charged upon oath for that he on or about the 15th day of November in the year of our Lord One thousand nine hundred and fifteen near Wiwa Hill Post Office in the Province of Saskatchewan aforesaid did steal about 300 bushels of flax the property of Claude Ficklin and was thereby guilty of theft.</p>

<p>Now the said WILLIAM JAMES HENRY VIGORS on his oath saith as follows:</p>

<p>I am a farmer residing at South West Quarter of Section Eighteen (18), Township Thirteen (13), Range Five (5), West of the Third Meridian in the Province of Saskatchewan, a quarter of a mile west of Wiwa Hill Post Office in the said Province of Saskatchewan. I was living there in the year 1915. I know Claude Ficklin, and he was living in my vicinity in the year 1915. I know Fletcher Decker, and in the year 1915 he was living north-east of me in the said vicinity.</p>

<pb/>

<p>Claude Ficklin farmed in 1915 about two miles from me in the said Province of Saskatchewan. Claude Ficklin called on me in the fall of 1917 with reference to some flax that had been stolen from him. This flax was stolen in 1915. As a result of this call of Claude Ficklin I went with him and saw Fletcher Decker. Fletcher Decker lived about four miles from my place already described in the Province of Saskatchewan. I said to Fletcher Decker, "Mr. Ficklin lost "some flax and he knows you took it, and you better "straighten up with him". Fletcher Decker said, "Is "that the flax you lost some time ago, Ficklin?" and Ficklin said to Decker "You know all about it". Ficklin told Decker to bring the equivalent down the next day or he would hand him over to the police. Fletcher Decker became all nervous and said that he was led into this by an older man, and he wanted to go and see his brother-in-law. His brother-in-law's name was Rosebaughs. Ficklin said he wanted Decker to come through with the price of his Flax. The next day Fletcher Decker paid Ficklin for the flax in the neighborhood of Four hundred and seventy-five ($475.00) Dollars. Claude Ficklin showed me the money. I think flax was worth about $1.75 a bushel that year. I understood that Fletcher Decker left the Province of Saskatchewan shortly after that. I understand the said Fletcher Decker is now in the United States of America.</p>

<p>Majesty's Justice of the Peace in and for the Province of Saskatchewan in the Dominion of Canada, hereby certify that the foregoing deposition was taken on oath before me at the City of Moose Jaw, Province of Saskatchewan aforesaid, and was signed by the deponent in my presence, and I declare that the offence with which FLETCHER DECKER is charged is the crime of theft as defined by the Criminal Code of Canada.</p>

<p>(Signed) A.J.G. MacEchen (seal)</p>
<p>A Justice of the Peace in and for the Province of Saskatchewan.</p>
