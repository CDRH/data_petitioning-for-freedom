the Province of British Columbia, and was then and there requested

City of Vancouver should call for said persons; that, in pursuance
of said request, he arrested the said Howard McMillan and Edward
Crofery, and held them until the 11th. day of May, 1889, when the 
United States martial of the Territory of Washington went to the 
City jail, in said City of Seattle, and took the said Edward Crofery 
and Howard Mc.Millan from the jailer of said City by virtue of a
warrant issued out of the United States Commisioners' Court, at the 
City of Seattle, upon the charge of bringing smuggled goods into the

are now in the custody and under the control of the said United 
States martial of Washington Territory, and this affiant is therefore 
unable to produce them before this honorable Court. That

under and by virtue of two telegrams received from the Chief of 
Police of the City of Vancouver, British Columbia, which are hereto
