<p>In the District Court of Washington
Territory and for the Fourth Judicial
District thereof holding terms at Spokane
Falls.
The Territory of Washington
vs.
Ray Raymond
Territory of Washington
County of Spokane}ss
Frederick Stanford being first duly
sworn depose and says- That he
is an attorney at law and practicing
as such at Spokane County Washington
Territory. That he has been restrained
as council by the Defendant Ray 
Raymond in the above entitled action.
That he came to reside at Spokane 
Falls on or about April 1886 and
has resided in said place ever since.
That he was present for a few moments 
during the examination of
defendant on the charge for which 
she now stands indicted or on
charge of murder for the holding of
one Finch before the committing 
magistrate in Spokane County
W.T. That he then and there saw
strong evidence of public excitement
and prejudice against the defendant.
That there and then and subsequently
at Spokane Falls from a number of
persons apparently qualified by law
to serve as trial jurors in said 
cause he heard the following and 
other like expressions made of and
concerning the defendant to wit:
She is guilty as hell- she ought
to have her neck stretched- she
ought to be lynched on general
principles- her conduct on the
street and side-walk is offensive.
She drives decent people off the
walk- she has tried to ride
over people on the street. She is
bold and insulting in her manners 
and respectable woman are
afraid to appear on the street
lest they may encounter her. She
started in to kill a man in
this town not long since- This
is not her first killing- She
will get a rope this time.
Applicant is satisfied that the
sentiment as above expressed obtains 
to a larger extent in this
immediate community and generally
and prejudicially throughout the
county of Spokane. That defendant 
on account of such sentiment
the excitement and prejudice of
the people of Spokane County cannot
have a fair and impartial trial
therein.
