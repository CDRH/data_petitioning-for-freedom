<p>Henry G. Struve, who was the mayor of Seattle in 1882 and 1883, was one of the leaders of the territorial bar. He came to Washington Territory in in 1860 and bought The Vancouver Chronicle.</p>
<p>Struve was admitted to the bar and early took an active interest in politics. He was elected attorney for the Second Judicial District two years after his arrival in the territory, became probate judge of Clark County, and served as a member of both houses of the Territorial Legislature.</p>
<p>In 1871 Struve moved to Olympia and took over The Puget Sound Daily Courier. Soon afterward, he was appointed territorial secretary by President Grant.</p>
<p>Struve moved to Seattle in 1879, and formed a law partnership with John Leary. Later Leary withdrew because of the demands of his property interests and Col. J. C. Haines, and Maurice McMicken joined Struve, the firm becoming Struve, Haines &amp; McMicken.</p>
<p>During Struve's term as mayor, many streets were graded and more than $500,000 was spent in public improvements. The city experienced a period of remarkable growth.</p>
<p>The Northern Pacific Railway completed its line to the coast during Struve's administration, and he did the honors for Seattle.</p>
<p>Struve later served as regent of the University of Washington, school director and judge advocate of the territory. His law firm had the largest coporation practice centering in Seattle.</p>
