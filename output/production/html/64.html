    <li>Summary of Proceedings: John W. McMenemy filed for a writ of Habeas Corpus for his son, John W. McMenemy Jr., minor, on the 26th of February of 1890 to free him from the custody of Henry P. Haze. Haze answered stating that he does not have custody, power, control, or possession of John W. McMenemy Jr. also known as "Dot" at this time. Haze did admit that he had custody of Dot on the 23rd of February, 1890 between the hours of 12 and 1 o'clock with the authority of Judge W. H. Hunter and Sherrif James P. Mallory. The petition then becomes focused on freeing Dot from the Sherrif of Douglas County. Judge Joseph R. Clarkson, in February of 1890, allows the writ and rules that Dot is being detained unlawfully. The next year, by May of 1891, John W. McMenemy is deceased. Judge George W. Doane ruled on the nature of the execution of the will on the 23rd of May, 1891. John C. Cowin and William W. Wallace were put in charge of executing the Will of John W. McMenemy. It is also ordered that Dot, his son, be put in the custody of Carrie Williamson who is paid the fifteen hundred dollars left to Dot. </li>
