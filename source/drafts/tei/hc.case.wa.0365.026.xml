<p>To HENRY M. WHITE, Commissioner of Immigration, Seattle, Wash.,
Or to any Immigration Inspector in the service of the United States</p>

<p>WHEREAS, from evidence submitted to me, it appears that the alien

JOHN MATTHEWS,

who landed at an unknown port,

on or about the 1st day of Sept., 1919, has been found in the United States
in violation of the immigration act of February 5, 1917, for the following among
other reasons:

That he has been sentenced, subsequent to the passage of said Act, to
imprisonment for a term of one year or more because of conviction in this
country of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years
after his entry into the United States; and that he was a person likely to
become a public charge at the time of his entry.</p>

<p>I LOUIS F. POST, Assistant Secretary of Labor, by
virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the laws of the United States,
do hereby command you to take into custody the said alien and grant him a
hearing - - - - - to enable him to show cause why he should
not be deported in conformity with law.</p>

<p>The expenses of detention hereunder, if necessary, are authorized, payable
from the appropriation: "Expenses of Regulating Immigration, 1921" Pending
further proceedings the alien may be released from custody upon furnishing
satisfactory bond in the sum of $1000.</p>

<p>For doing so, this shall be your sufficient warrant.
Witness my hand and seal this 5th day of November, 1920</p>
