    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Mary and T. LeFebvre were married in 1884, and sometime before this petition in 1888 she filed for divorce. Mary filed for divorce on the grounds that her husband does not make suitable provisions for her family and for cruel treatment. T took their 3 year-old child Henry "by force" at a restaurant and had been traveling around. Mary petitioned for custody of their child. Henry was hidden in Seattle at the point of this petition. Her petition included points about how the child has contracted a disease since he is being neglected by the father and needed to be in his mother's care. Mary believed he took the child to stop the divorce. The petition also stated that Mary has been supporting herself and Henry long before the divorce proceedings and still supported herself. The petition was granted, this file only holds the petition and the writ of habeas corpus.</li>
