<p>To the Honorable, the Judge of the Circuit 
Court for Saint Louis County in <unclear>vacation</unclear></p>

<p>The Petition of Frances Vanhorn by her next friend, Eliza Engle represents and shows that said Francis of the age 
of about 17 years and unmarried is illegally 
restrained of her liberty and is and has been detained and confined in a house or institution 
known as the "House of the Good Shepherd" located 
in the City of Saint Louis, Saint Louis County State of Missouri for about eighteen months last past that your petitioner does 
<unclear/> the name of the Matron Keeper or Governess 
of said Institutions; nor has your petitioner 
on application at said Institution been permitted to see or communicate with the said 
Francis but has been refused the same.</p>

<p>Your petitioner shows that said Francis 
is imprisoned, confined, and detained by the 
Matron Keeper or Governess of the said "House of 
the Good Shepherd" illegally and contrary to law 
there being no cause alleged against her, nor 
any legal process invoked by which she could 
be so imprisoned, confined or restrained--</p>

<p>Your petitioner further says that no application for the relief sought for by the Petition has 
been made to and referred by any court officer 
or officers superior to the Court over which your 
Honor provides, and to whom this petition is presented. Your Petitioner therefore prays that 
a Writ of Habeas Corpus may be issued requiring

the Matron Keeper or Governess of the said House 
of the Good Shepherd to appear and have with 
her the person of said Frances Vanhorn, with the 
cause of her imprisonment, confinement and detention if any such exist; and that upon the inspection thereof, and a hearing of the case; the 
said Frances may be discharged from such confinement and returned to her friends, and to her 
liberty; and to have such other order, or decree as she 
may be entitled to in the premises</p>

<p>Eliza Engle</p>
<p>her X mark</p>

<p>Eliza Engle being duly sworn says that the 
facts matters and things set forth in the foregoing 
petition are true to the best of her knowledge and belief.</p>

<p>Eliza Engle</p>
<p>X her mark</p>

<p>Sworn and subscribed before me this 22nd day of August 1865</p>
