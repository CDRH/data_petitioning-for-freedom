court Fourth Judicial 
District
holding terms at
Spokane Falls.</p>

<p>The Territory of Washington
vs.

<p>Territory of Washington
County of Spokane}ss</p>

<p>I, F. Donaldson
being duly sworn on my
oath depose and say:
That I have had the affidavits 
of T.C. Griffitts, A.T.
Caton, J. Kennedy Stout, and
Frederich Stanford, and
of Ray Raymond, filed in
this action in support of
said defendants motion for a 
continuance therein, and
know the contents of said
affidavits.</p>

<p>That I was present
at the house of said
defendant Ray Raymond in

<pb/>

the city of Spokane Falls in
said county on or about
the 20th day of June 1886,
at the time of the killing
of James Finch and witnessed
the transaction. That I now
reside and ever sice
said day have resided at the
precinct of Richland in
said county of Spokane,
about thirteen miles from 
the city of Spokane Falls.
That same time there after
and as affiant now recollects 
and verily believes the
time thereof as he, in the
early past of the seconth
of August in the year
1886. T.C. Griffitts and
J. Kennedy Stout, being the
said affidavits, and are
of counsel for said defendant 
Ray Raymond, came
to the dwelling house
of this affiant at said
Richland precinct and
held a conversation with 
this affiant concerning
the killing of said James
Finch. That said Griffitts
then and there stated to this

<pb/>

affiant that they (said 
Griffitts and said Stout)
had come to talk with
affiant about the killing
of said James Finch
and this affiant then and
there states to said Griffitts
and Stout and in their
presence and hearing
that he, this affiant 
was present at and witnessed 
the killing of
said Finch. That this
affiant afterward held
a conversation with said
Griffitts and Stout in
the house of said Ray Raymond 
at the peace where
the killing of said James
Finch, took place.</p>

<p>That affiant is well
acquainted with George
Wycoff mentioned in the
said affidavit; that he was
present at the time of
the killing of said James Finch,
and witnesses the same.
That at the time of the
conversation believes this
affiant first above
mentioned, this affiant

<pb/>

stated to said Griffitts
and Stout that said george
Wycoff was present at
and witnesses the killing
of said James Finch.
That he then and there
informed said Griffitts
and Stout that said George
Wycoff resided on Rotter's
Run, about five miles
from Rockford, in Spokane
County, W.T. That he does so
reside and then resided
at or near Rotter's Run
five miles from Rockford 
in said Spokane
County, Washington Territory,
affiant further deposes
and says that said George 
Wycoff has been present
and in attendance upon
our said court <del>ever</del> ever
since <del>the</del> and including
the tenth day of December 
A.D. 1886. That affiant 
<del>has</del> did, on Saturday
the 11th day of December
1886, and several times
therefore state to and
inform E.F. Whittier Sheriff
of Spokane County, that
said Wycoff was present

<pb/>

in Spokane Falls and
in attendance upon court
as a witness for the Territory 
in the above named
action.</p>

<p>That affiant has present 
and spoken 
to said T.C. Griffitts
during the past were
in Spokane Falls, and
that said Griffitts and
said Stout have well
known that affiant
was present in attendance 
upon court.
That affiant has never
had any conversation or
communication whatever
with the prosecuting atty.
or any person representing
the prosecution in this
action, relating to this
action or his testimony
therein, until since he
was served with subpoenas 
therein on the
third day of December
A.D. 1886.</p>

<p>That said George 
Wycoff was in position
at the time of the killing
of said James Finch

<pb/>

to have been able to
hear the substantially
all that happened and
to see past of the conversations 
relating to the
killing of said Finch.
That affiant was in a
position where he could
see and hear substantially 
all that happened
and he did see <del>subpoenas</del>
and hear sustantially
all that happened, relating 
to the killing of
James Finch. <del>That Charles

That affiant saw and
heard nothing of Charles
