    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In early December 1919, Katherine and Peter Hulm left their daughter, Frances, in the care of the Benedictine Sisters of Mt. Angel, Oregon. A few weeks later, Katherine petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to retrieve Frances from the Benedictine Sisters, which was granted. The Benedictine Sisters, responding as a corporation, answered that they did not release Frances because her father, Peter, had written them a letter stating that they were not to permit Katherine to be alone with the child. They made it clear that they were not detaining Frances for any other reason and would comply with the order of the court. After hearing the evidence, which included testimony that Peter had fled Oregon, Frances was released into the custody of her mother.</li>
