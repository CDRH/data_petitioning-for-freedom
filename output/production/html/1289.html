    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Sarah McDonough was convicted by Soderberg for public disorderly conduct when on May 14, 1888, she allegedly used abusive language on Emily Rose, calling her words such as thief and epithet. She is arrested and restrained by William Murphy, send to 20 days of hard labor, and petitions for writ, claiming imprisonment to be unlawful, that she didn't violate any law, that Soderberg had no jurisdiction in the trial and thus the process and proceedings involved in the conviction were void. The application was later denied and McDonough was to remain in custody.</li>
