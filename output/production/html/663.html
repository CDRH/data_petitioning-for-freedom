    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Angelo Rose traveled from Ohio to Omaha to visit relatives. He stated that he planned to return to Ohio within 2-3 weeks and had not left Ohio for the purpose of avoiding arrest. He was arrested 28 August 1899 and had been held for two days without a hearing and had not yet been scheduled for a hearing. Further, he states that he is not guilty of any crime in any jurisdiction. It was reported that he embezzled money from individuals in Ohio but he had not yet been found guilty. The individuals who filed that report were aware that the petitioner was leaving Ohio and intended to visit Omaha, NE. 

A complaint was filed on 11 August 1899 stating that Rose left Cuyahoga County, Ohio on or around 1 August 1899 and was a fugitive of justice for embezzlement. This document was signed by George C. Cockrell, Justice of the Peace. On 31 August 1899, the writ was allowed and Judge Baker wrote to Sheriff McDonald and asked that Rose be released to the custody of the State of Ohio. On 1 September 1899, Rose was ordered to be released from the custody of Douglas County to the custody of the State of Ohio. A supplemental petition was filed on 1 September 1899 stating that the representative of the Governor of Ohio did not have authority and, further, that Rose was not a fugitive from justice per the requisition papers from the State of Ohio and that no affidavit or indictment had been produced by the Governor of Ohio stating that Mr. E. D. Barry had authority to arrest Rose. The proceedings following this second petition are detailed in case file (hc.case.ne.1449).</li>
