      <p class="tei_p">That at all times hereinafter mentioned, complainant was and still is a subject of Scotland, lawfully domiciled in the United States of America; that she is not restrained of her liberty on any charge or conviction of crime, nor on any process issued on any warrant, committment or other process issued on any indictment or information; nor on any order or warrant of committment, otherwise than as hereinafter specified.</p>

And on the 7th day of July, 1918, pursuant to the mandate of said warrant, complainant was taken before W.P.

Asked by the inspector "What is the difference between your beliefs and anarchistic beliefs," the complainant  answered: "We believe in mass action and organization." The complainant further stated that her family belonged to the Independent Socialist party of Great Britain but that she had not been a member of it. That said questions and answers were reported by a stenographer employed by the United States Department of Labor and were subsequently transcribed and introduced in evidence against the complainent in substantiation of the charges obtained in the warrant of arrest hereinabove referred to, together with many other questions and answers having no bearing upon or in any way material to said charges. That there was attached to said transcript as exhibits, excerps from literature and songs published by the I.W.W. Publishing Company and other publishers. That the complainant stated that she had not read and did not accept all of said literature, and that said

      <p class="tei_p">That the complainant is now and ever since the 24th day of June, 1918, has been continuously restrained of her liberty in the detention station of the immigration service at Seattle, Washington, by Henry M.White, United States Commissioner of Labor stationed at Seattle, Washington, except during the time she was released on bail under the pretended aurthority of the warrant of arrest and order of deportation issued by the secretary of labor as hereinabove alleged, and not otherwise, and that said restraint and order of deportation is illegal for the following reasons, to-wit: That on the hearing conducted to inquire into the charges upon which the complainant is restrained of herliberty and ordered deported above referred to, no evidence whatever was introduced to sustain the charges preferred against the complainant or in any way sustaining an order directing that the complainant be deported from the United States, or any other order in any way restraining the complainant of her liberty and that the said warrant and order which the said secretary of labor has made is arbitrary and wholly void, and that the complainant has been at the times hereinabove referred to and now is restrained of her liberty without due process of law and deprived of her rights under the provisions of the Fifth Article of the Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">IV.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That complainant is informed and believes that there are only two copies of the testimony introduced on the hearing of the charges upon which she is restrained of her liberty and that one of said copies is in the possession of the secretary of labor of the United States at Washington, D.C. and the other in the possession of Henry M. White, commissioner of labor of the United States at Seattle, Washington. That complainant demanded a copy of said evidence in order that she might attach the same to this petition, but her demand therefor was refused by said Henry M.White. That

complainant is a wage earner and as a result of her long confinement and the drprivation of her usual means of support she is unable, by reason of her poverty, to pay for the preparation of such a copy, but deponent is informed by her attorney, and believes that if the said Henry M.White is required to produce the transcript of said evidence, now in his possession, and make the same a part of his return herein, or exhibit the same to the court, the verity of complainant's allegations in relation thereto will clearly appear therefrom.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">WHEREFORE, complainant prays for an order directed to Henry M.White, commissioner of labor of the United States, stationed at Seattle, Washington, requiring him to produce the body of the complainant in the above entitled court before the Honorable Jeremiah Neterer, the Judge thereof, on the 3rd day of February 1919, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and that he then and there show cause, if any he has, why the complainant should be further restrained of her liberty and further directing that the said Henry M.White also then and there produce, properly authenticated under his seal, the copy of the testimony taken at the hearing held pursuant to the mandate of the warrant of arrest issued by the secretary of labor pursuant to which the complainant, alias Margaret Roy, is restrained of her liberty by the said Henry M. White, and is deported by the said secretary of labor.</p>
