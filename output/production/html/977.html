    <li>Summary of Proceedings: The petition submitted by Mr. James H. Howard alleges that Police Judge Louis Berka issued a complaint against him, accusing him of a crime that does not allow a &#x201C;preliminary examination before an examining magistrate can be had.&#x201D; Nonetheless, the complaint was issued based on a preliminary examination. No other complaints were filed against Mr. Howard, meaning that this examination was not allowed under the law. 
This case involves a group of co-defendants; William F. Herman, James H. Howard (Petitioner), N. D. Coleman, and Harry Voorhees. Police Judge Berka submitted his complaint to the Court as an exhibit. This complaint commanded Sheriff John Drexel to take co-defendant William Herman into custody until he could be &#x201C;charged by due course of law.&#x201D; The crime alleged his &#x201C;obtaining money under false pretenses.&#x201D; His bail was set at one thousand dollars. In this complaint, Berka refers to himself as an examining magistrate.
Another exhibit submitted with this petition is the case of the State of Nebraska v. Herman, Howard, Coleman, and Voorhees which was tried before the Police Court of the City of Omaha on 17 February 1894. The group was accused of conspiring to cheat and defraud the United States National Bank of Omaha, the First National Bank of Omaha, Union National Bank of Omaha, and Omaha Savings Bank. They scammed these banks by saying that there was an organization called the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway Employee Association, that they were planning to throw a charity ball, and that the funds of the Charity Ball would be used to establish and maintain a free hospital for the railway workers and their families. Each of these banks purchased tickets to this ball totaling to $40.00 transferred to the co-defendants.
In response to the Petition, Judge Ambrose allowed the writ, returnable on 6 March 1894. The District Court commanded Sheriff Drexel to appear in court on 6 March 1894, bringing Mr. Howard with him along with their cause for detaining him. At trial Judge Ambrose determined that, based on the case presented, Mr. Howard was lawfully imprisoned and was ordered to return to custody and pay the costs of the proceeding.</li>
