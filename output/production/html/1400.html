    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Henry Bancroft filed a habeas corpus petition after he claimed that he was unlawfully deprived of liberty by John W. McDonald (Sheriff of Douglas County). He was fined $100 for selling alcohol without a permitted license and was told he would be imprisoned until that fine was paid. Bancroft refused to pay, so he was placed in jail. The petition was granted approved and he was asked to come before the court to plead his case. However, the fate of the bound party is unknown. </li>
