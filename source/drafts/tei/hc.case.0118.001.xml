<p>TALTON
v.
MAYES.
<hi rend="bold">No. 277.</hi>
May 18, 1896.</p>

<p>Appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">**986</hi> Habeas corpus proceeding by Bob Talton against Wash. Mayes, high sheriff of the Cherokee Nation. From a judgement discharging the writ and remanding petitioner to the custody of the sheriff, petitioner appeals. Affirmed.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">*376</hi> On February 15, 1893, a petition for habeas corpus was filed in the district court of the United States for the Western district of Arkansas, setting forth that the plaintiff therein (who is the appellant here) was, on the 31st day of December, <hi rend="bold">*377</hi> 1892, convicted, on a charge of murder, in a special supreme court of the Cherokee Nation, Cooweeskoowee district, and sentenced to be hanged on February 28, 1893, and that petitioner was then held, awaiting the time of execution, in the national jail at Tahlequah, Ind. T., by Wash. Mayes, high sheriff of the Cherokee Nation. It was further alleged that the petitioner was deprived of his liberty without due process of the law; <hi rend="bold">*987</hi> that he was in confinement in contravention to the constitution and laws of the United States, and also in violation of the constitution and laws of the Cherokee Nation. These contentions rested upon the averment that the indictment under which he had been tried and convicted was void because returned by a body consisting of 5 grand jurors, which was not only an insufficient number to consitute a grand jury under the constitution and laws of the United States, but also was wholly inadequate to compose such jury under the laws of the United States, but also was wholly inadequate to compose such jury under the laws of the Cherokee Nation, which, it was alleged, provided for a grand jury of 13, of which number a majority was necessary to find an indictment. The petitioner, moreover, averred that he had not been tried by a fair and impartial jury, and that many gross irregularities and errors to his prejudice had been committed on the trial. The district judge issued the writ, which was duly served upon the high sheriff, who produced the body of the petitioner, and made reture setting up the conviction and sentence as justifying the detention of the prisoner. Incorporated in the return was a transcript of the proceedings in the Cherokee court had upon the indictment and trail of the petitioner. In the copy of the indictment contained in the original transcript, filed in this court, it was recited that the indictment was found by the grand jury on the 1st day of December, 1892, while the offense therein stated was alleged to have been committed 'on or about the 3d day of December, 1892.' The evidence contained in the transcript, however, showed that the offense was committed on November 3, 1892, and in a supplement to the transcript, filed in this court, it appears that said date was given in the indictment. No motion or demurrer or other attack upon the sufficiency of the indictment was made upon the trail in the Cherokee court based upon the ground that the offense was stated in the indictment to have been committed on a date subsequent to the finding of the indictment, nor is there any specification of error of that character contained in the petition for the allowance of the writ or habeas corpus. After hearing, the district judge discharged the write and remanded the petitioner to the custody of the sheriff, and from this judgement the appeal now under consideration was allowed.</p>

<p>The question whether a statute of the Cherokee Nation, not repugnant to the constitution of the United States or any treaty or law thereof, has been repealed by another statute of that nation, and the determination of what is the existing law of the Cherokee Nation as to the constitution of the grand jury, is a matter solely within the jurisdiction of the courts of that Nation.</p>

<p>The crime of murder committed by one Cherokee Indian upon another within the jurisdiction of the Cherokee Nation is an offense, not against the United States, but against the local laws of the Cherokee Nation.</p>

<p>The powers of local government exercised by the Cherokee Nation are local powers, not created by the constitution, and hence are not operated upon by amendment 5 thereof, requiring a presentment by a grand jury in the case of a capital or other infamous crime.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice WHITE, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>

<p>Prior to May, 1892, a law enacted by the legislature of the Cherokee Nation made it the duty of the judges of the circuit and district courts of the Nation, 14 days before the commencement of the first regular term of said courts, to furnish to the sheriff a list of the names of 5 persons, who should be summoned by the sheriff to act as grand jurors for that district during the year. The first regular term of the courts named commenced on the second second Monday in May. On November 28, 1892, a law was enacted providing for the summoning and impaneling of a grand jury of 13, the names of the persons to compose such jury to be furnished to the sheriff, as under the previous law, 14 days before the commencement of the regular term of the circuit and district courts. There was no express repeal of the provisions of the prior law. Under the terms of the act of November 28, 1892, a grand jury could not have been impaneled before the term beginning on the second Monday of May, 1893. The indictment in question was returned in December, 1892, by a grand jury consisting of five persons, which grand jury had been impaneled under the prior law, to serve during the year 1892.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">*379</hi> The right of the appellant to the relief which he seeks must exist, if at all, by virtue of section 753 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, which is as follows:</p>
