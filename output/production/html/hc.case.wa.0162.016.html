      <p class="tei_p">I was one of the Coroners 
Jury who held an inquest on
the body of James Finch on 
the morning of June 26th 1886
and heard the testimony of 
Ruby Stanley at that time 
I have now read the testimony as 
reduced to writing and <del>testified to
here by Dr .C.J. Penfield &amp; J.H. Boyd</del>
and seems to me in substance 
to be the same</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">
         <span class="tei_add">Cross</span> I think it contains
in substance all she said I could 
not say it was the exact language She 
might have used ifs and ands 
it is somewhat abreviated it is 
not the exact language but is in 
substance the same</p>

      <p class="tei_p">J.C. Hanna</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Subscribed and sworn to before me on this July 
1st 1886</p>
