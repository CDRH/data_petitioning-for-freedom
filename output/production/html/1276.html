    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On 21 January 1915 George L. German filed a complaint stating that Joseph Miller, Bernard Miller, and Peter Miller committed the offense of breaching stolen property on 18 January 1915. They were brought before the Police Judge for South Omaha, H. W. Reed were they pled not guilty. As such, the cause was continued to 3 February 1915. 
On 26 February 1915, F. C. Hagerman, George Christ, John Laininger, J. F. Anderson, and L. L. Fuller gave testimony in the Police Court while the defendants were not present and were not able to hear or respond to the testimony made against them. This right was not waived, expressly or implicitly, by any of the men or their attorneys.
Joseph, Bernard, and Peter Miller and Ed Mazone submitted a petition that stated that they were being unlawfully restrained of their liberty by South Omaha Chief of Police, John Briggs, and a city jailer, Michael Corcoran. The four men were convicted of concealing stolen property in the South Omaha Police Court on 26 March 1915. The charges were under &#xA7; 8635 of the 1913 Revised Statutes of Nebraska. The issue they cited was that this section was repealed by House Roll No. 47 which was approved by the Governor on 16 March 1915. Despite this repeal, the four men were charged with the aforementioned crime, fined $17.00 each, and costs were assessed at $3.00 each. After that conviction, the men were confined in the City Jail &#x201C;without authority of law.&#x201D; 
The petition thus asserted that the petitioner&#x2019;s constitutional rights were violated during the trial and that their conviction and detention were not made under current law. Therefore, they asked for a writ of Habeas Corpus. 
Judge William A. Redick ordered that a writ be allowed, returnable 27 March 1915. Sheriff Felix J. McShane, Jr. filed his writ return on 5 April 1915, it stated that the writ was received on 26 March 1915 and was served the same day to John Briggs and Michael Corcoran. 
E. R. Leigh, Attorney for Respondents, filed Briggs and Corcoran&#x2019;s answer on 31 March 1915; it stated that the four petitioners were convicted upon the charge of concealing stolen property with a value less than $35.00, fined $20.00 each, and committed to the county jail until they paid those fines. They also submitted the Mittimi as Exhibits, these documents were each signed by H. W. Reed, the South Omaha Police Court Judge, on 26 March 1915. These Mittimi stated that on 21 January 1915, George L. German had observed Ed Magnus, Joseph Miller, Bernard Miller, and Peter Miller concealing stolen property. 
The Appearance Docket noted that, at the hearing on 27 March 1915, realtors were released &#x201C;on own recognizance by agreement of counsel.&#x201D;</li>
