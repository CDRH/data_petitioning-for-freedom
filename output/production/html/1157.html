    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Petitioner, George Compton, was arrested on 21 April 1898 on a vagrancy charge. On that same day, he was assigned to the county jail for 30 days. He was not granted a trial at this point. 
Police Judge Gordon issued a mittimus, stating that this 30 day sentence had been imposed at an earlier date but was suspended based on the condition that Compton leave the city and not return. The initial sentence had been imposed on 6 December 1897. The Police Judge asserts that he failed to comply with these terms; leading to his arrest in Omaha on the charge of vagrancy, and was placed in the County Jail to complete his initial sentence. On 21 April 1898, a writ for the offense of vagrancy was submitted by Police Judge Gordon and signed by Sheriff McDonald and Deputy Sheriff Lewis detailing these claims. 
The District Court (Judge Slabaugh) heard the case on 6 May 1898. During this trial, Judge Slabaugh determined that no offense had been committed, that Compton was unlawfully being deprived of his liberty, and that Sheriff McDonald should release him from custody. On 7 May 1898, Judge Slabaugh signed an Order to Discharge the Prisoner on Writ of Habeas Corpus. 
On 17 May 1898, a document was submitted by the Albyn L. Frank (District Court Clerk) motioning for Douglas County to pay the costs of the trial.</li>
