    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On behalf of Edward and Martha Shelmidine, William H. Moore petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that they were unlawfully detained by Gable (first name unknown), a marshal in Waverly, Nebraska. Judge Cornish granted the petition. In Gable's response, he alleges that he is holding the couple on orders of the Governor of Texas, Joseph D. Sayers, who issued an extradition warrant. In case files, Martha Shelmidine is also referred to as Mrs. M. M. Claxton. After reviewing evidence, Judge Cornish allowed the writ and ordered that the Shelmidines be released from custody. According to secondary source research, Martha was allegedly previously married in Texas and married Edward in Nebraska. She was allegedly facing charges of bigamy in Texas, which is presumably why Sayers issued an extradition warrant.</li>
