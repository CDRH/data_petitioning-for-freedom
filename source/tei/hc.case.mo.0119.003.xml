<p>To the Honorable Law Commissioners Court of St. Louis County:</p>

<p>Your petitioners respectfully represents 
that one Martha Edwards, a female minor child of the age 
of nine years, is unjustly and unlawfully imprisoned 
and restrained of her liberty by one Chas. G. Ward, 
at his place of residence on Eighth street between Locust 
and St. Charles streets, in the city of St. Louis or his agents or servants that your 
petitioner is the mother of said child, and her legal 
guardian, and entitled to her care and custody; that 
said child was forcibly and violently taken from your 
petitioner, at her place of residence in said city, by 
two persons by name to your petitioner unknown, and 
forcibly and violently incarcerated and confined at 
the place of residence of said Ward as aforesaid 
that said child was taken and confined as aforesaid 
as your petitioner believes, without any process, warrant, 
or other authority of law that your petitioner is now 
denied by said Ward, his servants and agents, admission 
to the company and presence of her said child <del>as is 
her right</del> and is prevented from providing for and 
protecting her said child, as it is her right and duty to 
do and that no application for the relief sought for by this petition, has been made to and refused by <del>any</del> 
Court officer or officers, inferior to your Hon Court our petitioner therefore prays that a writ of habeas corpus 
may be issued to said Chas. G. Ward, commanding him to produce 
the body of said Martha Edwards before your Honorable Court, that 
she may be restored to the custody of your petitioner</p>

<p>Eliza Edwards her mark </p>

that the matters and things stated in the within and 
foregoing petition, are true, to the best of her knowledge and 
belief</p>
