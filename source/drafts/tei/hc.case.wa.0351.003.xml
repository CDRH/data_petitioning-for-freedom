<p>John Herring
vs
J.C. Jewett
Sheriff, Whatcom
County</p>

<p>Before Judge Fitzhugh
Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court and District Judge of the 3rd
Judicial District Washington Territory</p>

<p>Habeas Corpus</p>

<p>John Herring plaintiff in the above writ
1st he cause complains of J.C. Jewett defendant
herein, and for cause of complaint sets forth, that
the said plaintiff is restrained of his liberty by
the said J.C. Jewett, acting as Sheriff of the
County of Whatcom in said Territory that
said restraint is imposed in the Town of What-
com in the same, under the order of the Judges of
the Probate Criminal Court of said County to wit
N. Young presiding Judge and H.R Crosbie
Associate</p>

<p>2nd The cause or pretense of the restraint
has been, that one Moses Phillips made a
complaint against said plaintiff on oath in the said
Criminal Court as for a public nuisance, and
complained that said plaintiff kept a number
of hogs, roaming about the streets, and lying under
houses breeding filth and that he had built
a pig jam in the streets</p>

<p>To this complaint the defendant therein
by his counsel demand, on the ground, that hogs
lying under the houses of some citizens, and breed-
ing filth be it true, was a private nuisance, and
not a public one. Also that the allegation that</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>the hogs roamed about the streets did not contain
facts sufficnet to constitute a criminal acion;
which was overuled by the Court.</p>

<p>Defendant then filed his answer stating
that the hogs in question did not belong to him,
that the pig jam was not an obstruction to the
street nor was any person prevented from passing
along the same - that said pass way was
not a public street so for as he knew, and that
it was only used by foot people, and not by
waggons - and that he was not guilty of a
public offense - on the trial defendant's counsel
asked six instructions, onyl of of which was
given. See paper on file.</p>

<p>The trial was had on the 27th day of April
1859 and the Jury brought in a verdict of guilty
fine $5 Costs $115 Total $120</p>

<p>(When the verdict was rendered) When the
verdict was rendered the Court ordered the said
veridct to be recorded as a judgment and
immediately adjourned the Court.</p>

<p>On the convening the Court next morning the
28th the defendant's Counsel moved the Court for
a new trial on three grounds:
First. Newly discovered evidence. Second
Misdirection of the Jury and admission of illegal
evidence, and Third, Refusal of the Court to
allow defendant to be heard by Counsel
before the Jury. By all which said then defendant</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Herring was materially <unclear></unclear> in regard to his
substantial rights.</p>

<p>This application was refused on the grounds that
it should have been made before judgment; which
if it be a judgment would be impossible as no time
intervened to permit it</p>

<p>These are the causes according to the best of
the knowledge of complainant</p>

<p>3rd. The restraint is alleged to be illegal on the
grounds, just, that the verdict was recorded
as a judgment and not as a verdict - therefore
the verdict was not recorded as such. Second,
That no sentence was legally imposed nor
judgment entered. Third, that defendant was not
called nor did he appear for sentence nor was he
asked. "Whether he had any legal cause to show
why judgment should not be pronounced against
him". -- Fourth, That he was utterly debaned
from the benefit of new trial and a motion in
arrest of the Judgement by the Action of the court.
Fifth-- Refusal of the court to allow deft's
counsel to address the jury. Sixth, that there
is legally no final Judgement in said cause.
Seventh-- That there is no process issued on
any judgement out of said Court <del></del>
authorizing the said Jewett deft as aforesaid
commanding him to have the said
Herring imprisoned or to restrain him of his
liberty.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Plaintiff therefor prays, that a Writ of Habeas
Corpus may be granted by said Judge Fitzhugh--
Judge as aforesaid, and directed to the
said Jewett-- Sheriff as aforesaid commanding him
to have the said Herring before him at such time and
place as he shall designate, to do and 
what shall be ordered, concerning him, and
have then and there said writ.</p>
