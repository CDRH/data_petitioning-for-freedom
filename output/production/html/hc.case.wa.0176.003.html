      <p class="tei_p">In the Matter of the Application
of Marie Miler for Writ of Habeas 
Corpus. } No. 2457.
Filed May 14, 1913</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Cushman, District Judge.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Petitioner seeks her discharge upon habeas corpus
from the custody of the Commissioner of Immigration, who holds
her under a warrant of deportation. She alleges that at the 
hearing for her deportation, she was not represented by counsel;
that she had retained counsel before the hearing and had paid
his fee, but he failed to appear and represent her; that she
does not understand the English language and that the evidence
on which she was ordered deported was a false affidavit, which
she had no opportunity to controvert, owing to the fact that
counsel, whom she had retained, did nothing to protect her rights.
That the affidavit against her was made by a former partner to
get rid of her to acquire her property. That she is about to
be deported without due process of law and without an apportunity
to be heard.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The answer of the Commissioner of Immigration shows
that the petitioner was arrested, charged with being an alien
found in the United States in violation of the Act of Congress
approved Feburary 20, 1907, as amended in the Act approved 
March 28, 1910, to-wit: "That the said alien was connected
with a house of prostitution, and practiced prostitution and
derived benefits therefrom after she entered the United States";

that she was thereafter examined on January 13, 1913, by an
Inspector, under oath, as to her right to remain in the United States; that she was informed of her right to employ an attorney:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"that she then stated that she would have a friend of hers
get an attorney, and that she afterwards did employ an attorney,
to-wit: One Roger Marchetti, to represent her, and that thereafter
on numerous and sundry occasions said Inspector,
Thos M. Fisher, and other members of the Department of Commerce
and Labor, stationed at Seattle, Washington, endeavored
to induce the said Roger Marchetti to present any other or
further evidence which he might have touching the matter of
said deportation, and finally, on March 5, 1913, A.T. White,
Inspector of said Bureau, personally delievered to said Roger
Marchetti a letter notifying him, the said Roger Marchetti,
that further proceedings would be had in said matter on March 
7, 1913, at the Detention House in Seattle, Washington, a failure
on his part to appear would be considered as notice that
he had no further evidence to produce, and that the record
would then be submitted to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor
for his decision, a copy of which letter is hereto attached
and made a part hereof.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"That on March 7, 1913, the said Roger Marchetti, informed
the Inspector that he could not take the matter up that day,
but would take it up the next morning without fail, and neither 
the next morning, nor at any other time, did the said Roger
Marchetti appear in said proceeding, or produce or offer to
produce any other or further evidence, nor did the said Marie,
or Mary, Miler, at any time offer to produce or procure any
other or further evidence, and that thereupon the record of
said proceeding, together with the report of the examining
Inspector, and with the report of Commissioner Ellis DeBruler,
was forwarded to the Department of Labor at Washington, D.C.,
and recieved by it, and said Department did then and there 
carefully consider said matters, and on the 18th day of March,
1913, said Department, and also W.B. Wilson, Secretary of
Labor, became and were satisifed that said alien was one who
had been found practicing prostitution and was a prostitute
after her entry to the United States, and decided adversely
to said alien, and order her deported to the country from
whence she came."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The answer and return further denies the jurisdiction of the
court to review the acts of the Secretary of Commerce and
Labor.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Petitioner replying admits the arrest, but denies
that she practiced prostitution. She alleges that it was not
until after her examination that she was informed of her right 
to be represented by an attorney. Denies that the Immigration
officer gave notice of the proceedings to her attorney. Admits
that her attorney did not produce any evidence to controvert
the evidence produced against her. Alleges that she
has been ready and willing at all times to produce further

It is not contended but that the evidence upon the hearing
was sufficient to justify the warrant of deportation; but it
is argued that, by being deprived of the benefit of counsel,
petitioner, in effect, had no hearing.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It is apparent from the petition, the return of
the Commissioner and reply that petitioner was informed of
her right to have counsel before the conclusion of her hearing:
i.e., at the conclusion of the officer's examination,
he informed her of her right to have an attorney, and held
the hearing open for the purpose of receiving such testimony
as she might offer. It may be that nothing further was actually
heard, but the opportunity was afforded, and that is 
all the law requires. It is alleged in her petition that
she "had retained counsel before hearing". Therefore,
she could not have been prejudiced by any delay in the notice.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Enough is disclosed to show that petitioner had a 
fair, if summary, hearing. If petitioner's attorney failed
to be present at any of her hearings, it is nothing that
respondent is charged, or shown to have been responsible for,
nor any one concerned in the proceedings for deportation. 
She has not been deprived of any right of appeal by the remissness 
of her attorney, as has been argued, for there is
no appeal. The order of deportation was issued by the Secretary
of Commerce and Labor.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The mere allegation in the reply that petitioner
has been "prevented from producidng her evidence", is it means
anything more than the failure of her attorney to serve her,
is too meagre an allegation upon which to base a right, or
excuse a default. It is a mere conclusion. Of the parties
to the proceedings, petitioner, alone, is responsible for the
neglect of her attorney. In any event, the action of the
Secretary of Commerce and Labor in refusing to reopen the
case on that account rests in his discretion and no such abuse
of that discretion is shown as can be said to the oppressive 
or arcitrary.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The rule to show cause is discharged.</p>
