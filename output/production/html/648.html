    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Allan Young claimed to be unlawfully deprived of his liberty by Ed Simpson, a constable for Douglas County Nebraska. He was arrested upon a warrant for bastardy, issued by Justice of the Peace, Ed Leeder. According to Young, Careline Peterson made the complaint that she was pregnant with his bastard child and was accordingly arrested on December 29, 1914. However, on that same day they were able to come up with an agreeable and satisfactory settlement to both parties, agreeing to dismiss persecution. She then again, filed another complaint by herself, charging him again with being the father of a bastard child on January 18, 1915 and Young again was arrested by Ed Leeder. Young showed a copy of the agreement that said he was willing to &#x201C;pay for inlaying expenses, support, and maintenance of said child&#x2026;[and] for all damages on account for her alleged pregnancy.&#x201D; The writ was allowed and he was released from custody.</li>
