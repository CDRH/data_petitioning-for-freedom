    <li>Summary of Proceedings: On June 19, 1916, Roy Walker was arrested and imprisoned without a warrant. With the help of his attorney Amos P. Scruggs, a prominent Black attorney in Omaha and future candidate for the House of Representatives, he filed a writ of habeus corpus on June 23, 1916, against the chief of police, chief of detectives, and the captain of police. Willis G. Sears allowed the writ, as he had been held without any legal proceedings actually being formally initiated against him, but the legal documents provide little insight into his fate.</li>
