<p><del>16</del></p>
<p>Ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the said law of the

in so far as it prohibits or attempts to prohibit the selling, giving,
or furnishing to any one by the importer of a box of packages of
paper-wrapped cigarettes, each package containing ten paper-
wrapped cigarettes, each enclosed in paper and tin-fol wrappers,
each bundle or package having the U. S. internal revenue stamp
and the number of manufacturing district and State, which box was
received by the importer packed in a wooden packing case or carton,
and said carton packed with orthers in a common pine shipping
case, and that the said M. L. Coovert be by said George Nerton,
sheriff of Clarke county, forthwith discharged from imprisonment
and detention for the cause as in said petition aforesaid.</p>
<p>And it is further ordered, adjusted, and decreed that the said M.
L. Coovert, petitioner, shall enter into a recognizance in the sum of 
two hundred and fifty ($250.00) dollars with the clerk of this court,
with one or more sureties, for his appearance to answer the judgement
of the appellate court in the premises.</p>
<p>C. H. Hanford, Judge.</p>
<p>Dated this 22nd day of June, 1893. <add>"</add></p>
