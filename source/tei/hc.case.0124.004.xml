<p>In the District Court of Washington
Territory and for the First Judicial 
District thereof holding terms at Cheney in 
Spokane County</p>

<p>In the matter of the petition
of Daniel Ainsworth for a 
writ of Habeas Corpus–}</p>

<p>To the Honorable Samuel C. Wingard
the judge of the above entitled court.</p>

<p>The petition of Daniel Ainsworth
respectfully shows=</p>

<p>First: That he is unlawfully restrained 
of his liberty at Cheney aforesaid, by 
P.W. Dillon, the Sheriff of Spokane
County aforesaid.</p>

<p>Second: That the cause or pretense 
of said restraint according to the best
knowledge and belief of the petitioner, is, 
that said Sheriff holds a commitment 
issued by one J.W. Range, a justice of
the peace in and for said Spokane County
aforesaid, Cheney Precinct, dated November
17th 1884, commanding him the said sheriff

<pb/>

to safely keep the said Daniel Ainsworth
until discharged by due course of
law to writ: until discharged by the 
District Court aforesaid–</p>

<p>Third: That said restraint is illegal 
and such illegality consists in this.
On the 13th day of November 1884, one 
F.V. Hoyt made a complaint in writing
and under oath, charging the said Daniel 
Ainsworth with having obtained money
from him, the said F.V. Hoyt, by
means of false pretences: That said 
complaint does not charge said Ainsworth with
having obtained said money through 
any fraudulent intent, or designedly, or
that said Ainsworth then and there knew
any such pretences to be false–</p>

<p>That on said complaint a preliminary
examination of said <del/> defendant the petitioner herein was
had before said justice on the 17th day 
of November 1884, and on said 
examination, there was no testimony 
whatever offered, that any representation 
made by said Ainsworth, relative to the 
matter changed in said complaint was in
fact false, or that said Ainsworth

<pb/>

knew any such representation to 
be false, or that any such 
representation was made for the 
purpose, or with the intent of defrauding
the said Hoyt, or any other person.
Nor was there any testimony offered
on said examination in any manner 
tending to prove any crime, having 
been committed by said Ainsworth.
Wherefore your petitioner prays that 
he may be forthwith brought before
your Honor, the said complaint and the 
testimony addresed thereunder reviewed
and the <del/> petitioner discharged–</p>

<p>W.R. Andrews<lb/>
Attorney for said petitioner </p>

<p>Territory of Washington
County of Walla Walla } ss</p>

<p>W.R. Andrews being first duly
sworn, deposes and says:</p>

<p>That he is the attorney for Daniel 
Ainsworth, the petitioner above named
and makes this <unclear>verification</unclear> in
behalf of said petitioner–</p>

<p>That he, affiant, has read the

<pb/>

said petition, knows the contents
thereof, and that the matters and things
therein alleged are true–</p>

before me November 18th, 1884}</p>
