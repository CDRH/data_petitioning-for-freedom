Your brother, Sam Plastino, has been given a hearing to show his right

United States again.</p> 
<p>Q When did you first come to the United States? A I think in 1881.</p> 
<p>Q When did you go back to Italy? A I went back to Italy to sell some
property which is still there and a little later returned to the United
States at the port of New York about twelve years ago.</p>

in this country; I don't know just when.</p>
<p>Q Has Sam Plastino to your knowledge ever been out of the United States
since he entered with out? A No, not to my knowledge.</p> 

<p>STATEMENT BY INSPECTOR FISHER:</p>  
<p>I examined the naturalization records in U. S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Washington and find that the record shows that Sam
Plastino claimed he was born in Altilia, Italy, September 7, 1886, and came from
Naples, Italy, on the s. s. "Abriundra" to the port of New York about the 10th
day of June, 1897, and declared his intention to become a citizen of the
United States before W. H. Han, Clerk of the U. S. District Court at Spokane,
Washington, March 22, 1911.</p> 
<p>Sam Plastino was convicted after a hearing in the U. S. District Court
at Tacoma, Washington, for violating the White-Slave Traffic Act in that he
assisted in the transportation of one Goldie Cardiff from Seattle, Washington,
to San Francisco, California, for purposes of prostitution. The evidence
adduced at the hearing showed that Sam Plastino had received the earnings of
Goldie Cardiff, prostitute, for several years; that he had also received the
earnings of two other prostitutes prior and subsequent to his meeting Goldie
Cardiff.</p> 
<p>After considering the testimony adduced in this case, I find Sam Plastino
is an Alien, a citizen of Italy; that he entered the United States through the
port of New York during the year 1897; that he has been found receiving,
sharing in, and deriving benefit in whole, or in part, from the earnings of
a prostitute after his entry into the United States. I therefore respect-
fully recommend his deportation to the country whence he came or of which he
is a citizen or subject, in conformity with law.</p>
<pb></pb> 
<p>SAM PLASTINO</p> 
<p>I hereby certify that the foregoing is a true transcript of the testimony
as dictated to me by Inspector Fisher.</p>
