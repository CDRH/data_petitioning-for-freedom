In the District Court of the 3rd Judicial District of Washington Territory, holding
Terms at Seattle, for the County of King W.T.

Habeas Corpus.

In answer to the writ of Habeas Corpus served upon me on the 25th day of June 1889
commanding me that I have the body of Wa Kim, by me imprisoned and detained as it
is said, together with the time and cause of such imprisonment and detention before
the Hon. C. H. Hanford, Judge of the aforesaid Court, at the Court House in the City
of Seattle W.T. on June 27th 1889 at the hour of 10 o'clock A.M. I would say that
on the 13th day of June 1889 a writ of Deportation was issued against the said Wa
Kim et al by the said Court and placed in my hands for execution a copy of the said
writ is hereto attached and marked "Exhibit A" and made a part of this return or answer.
I thereupon endeavored to execute the said writ as will more fully appear by reference
to the return upon said writ a copy of which is herto attached and marked "exhibit
B." and made a part of this answer.

The Court thereupon refused to discharge the said prisoner Wa Kim et al but left



him and the other prisoners in the custody of the United States Marshal stating that
the writs must be executed, and that he, the Hon. C. H. Hanford, would write to the
President, concerning the means by which the law be executed and the writs enforced.
I have here the body of the said Wa Kim to receive the further order of the court
