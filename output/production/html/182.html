    <li>Summary of Proceedings: In the summer of 1905, an Omaha Indian man named Louis Dick petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of his two children, whom he called Lucy and Emory, claiming the pair were being detained at the Genoa Indian Industrial School. The school's superintendent, W. H. Winslow, responded that Louis had enrolled Lucy for a three-year term in the fall of 1903, and that Emory, whom Winslow said was actually called Emily, was enrolled at Genoa by order of the Thurston County District Court in January 1904. After hearing the evidence, the Dick children were remanded to the custody of the school superintendent.</li>
