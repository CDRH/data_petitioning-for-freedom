    <li>Summary of Proceedings:  On June 25, 1916, the police took Maurice Greenwalt into custody. In his petition, he claimed that since then, they kept him imprisoned, detained, confined, and restrained on suspicion of committing robbery with Elmer Johnson in Douglas County. On June 27, 1916, there was a preliminary hearing and an examination of the witnesses, and it was conclusively shown that there was no probable cause for holding Greenwalt for robbery. So, the same day, Greenwalt petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he should have been discharged and the complaint should have been dismissed as a result of the ruling. He further claimed that the complaint was made without probable cause, and the evidence failed to show probable cause to hold Greenwalt. Greenwalt claimed that Felix J. McShane, Henry Schroeder, Henry W. Dunn, Steven Maloney, Michael F. Dempsey, and John Byrnes unlawfully imprisoned, detained, confined, and restrained him of his liberty. On June 27, 1916, the judge accepted the petition but removed all the named respondents in the original petition except for Sheriff McShane and County Jailor Schroeder. On June 28, 1916, the Judge issued a writ of habeas corpus; however, the outcome of this proceeding is unknown.</li>
