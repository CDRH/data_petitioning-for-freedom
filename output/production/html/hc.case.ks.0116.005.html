      <p class="tei_p">sworn and testified as follows.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I was present at the examination of Keokuk and the other Indians before the commission. The examination was before me. there was something said about the Indians not giving bail and Wiley the defendant said "then they will have to go to jail" He might have said "send them to jail" Wiley had testified before Captain Christian came in. I did not discover any thing very remarkable about Wiley's manner. He may have been excited some what. Mr. Christian came in after the examination had proceeded some way and announced himself as attorney for the Indians under arrest and asked an interview with the Indians and called Keokuk out of the room. Mr. Dorwin (United States deputy Marshall) objected to Keokuk and the other Indians going with Mr Christian unless he accompanied them I think Mr Wiley also objected. I am not positive as to Mr Wiley</p>

      <p class="tei_p">objecting. I told the Marshall to let Mr Christian have a private interview. he was permitted to have such interview. When Mr Christian with his clients the Indians came into the room after the interview mentioned I informed Mr Christian that Mr Wiley had been sworn and examined already and that he could ask any question he chose. I cannot now remember whether Mr Christian asked any question. my best recollection is that he based his defence on the legal question at issue and no witnesses were examined after Gov Shannon came in and after Mr Christian for the Indians came into the case, when I announced my decision that the Indians would be bound over to court there was a good deal of confusion in the room. Mr Christian and Mr Powers the interpreter advised the defendants (the Indians) not to give Bail. Mr Wiley said then they would have to go to jail or something to that</p>

I issued an order that the Marshall take charge of defendants the Indians and give them an opportunity to get bail if necessary allowing them to go to the Sac &amp; Fox Reserve. All the parties soon left my office I afterwards reduced the order I made to writing and delivered it to the Marshall Dorwin. During the progress of the examination of the Indians before me defendant (Wiley) bore an active part and was much in earnest:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Andrew Carnes was sworn and testified as follows. On the 23d day of November AD 1868 I was keeping the jail for sheriff Walker. I received Keokuk and the other Indians at the jail. There were at the time both white and colored prisoners at the jail. There was one confined for Burglary one for Robbery and some for city offences. The deputy Marshall brought the Indians to the jail about dark</p>

I went to the office of Mr Montgomery and asked for a consultation with the Indians. Dorwin and Wiley objected to their going out unless they went with them and heard what was said.
