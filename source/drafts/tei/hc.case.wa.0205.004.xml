<p>Feb 3 1919</p>

<p>F.M. Harshberger, Clerk</p>
<p>By S.E. Leitch Deputy</p>

<p>No. 4523</p>
<p>Complaint.</p>

<p>In the Matter of the Application of BARTOLOMEO MASSULO, for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>

<p>The complainant Bartolomeo Massulo, appearing by Ralph S. Pierce, his attorney, complains to the court and alleges and petitions as follows:</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>That at all times hereinafter mentioned, complainant was and still is a subject of Italy, lawfully domiciled in the United States of America; that he is not restrained of his liberty on any charge or conviction of crime, nor on any process issued on any warrant, committment or other process issued on any indictment or information; nor on any order or warrant of committment, otherwise than as hereinafter specified.</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>That on the 8th day of November, 1917, complainant was arrested by an immigration inspector of the United States on a warrant of arrest issued by the secretary of labor of the United Sates wherein complainant is charged with being an alien and that he was found advocating or teaching anarchy or the over-throw by force or violence of the government of the United States or of all forms of law and of the assassination of public officials, and that he was a person likely to become a public charge at the time of his entry into the United States and that on the 12th day of November, 1917, pursuant to the said warrant, complainant was taken before Thomas M.Fischer, immigration inspector of the United States at Seattle, Washington, and given a hearing for the purpose of inquiring into the merits of said charge; that he was questioned by the said Thomas M.Fisher and in reply to said questions, answered: That he was 36 years old, was born in Italy; that he entered the United States in 1913 and passed inspection at the time of his entry. That he had subscribed for a certain paper for a period of one year and paid $1.00 for it; that he did not belong to any organization at any time. Asked if he believed in anarchy, answered: "I do not believe, I am working for man and havent gotten to the bottom of the books." Asked if he assisted in distributing anarchistic literature among other italians, answered: "No, I did not. I got quite a few books."</p>

<p>Q. You advocated the over-throw of the government of the United States and the government of Italy, did you not?</p>

<p>A. No, I never talk.</p>

<p>Q. You believe in it, do you not, in the over-throw of the Italian government and the government of the United States?</p>

<p>A. I do not believe in it.</p>

<p>Questioned by his counsel, complainant answered as follows:</p>

<p>Q. Do you know what anarchism means?</p>

<p>A. No.</p>

<p>Q. And you are not an anarchist?</p>

<p>A. No, I do not know what it is.</p>

<p>Q. Do you believe in the over-throw of governments by force or violence?</p>

<p>A. No.</p>

<p>Q. Do you believe in or advocate the destruction of property?</p>

<p>A. No, why we have to be destructive, I don't believe in it.</p>

<p>Q. Do you intend to reside in this country, to make it your home?</p>

<p>A. Yes, that is what I am here to work for.</p>

<p>Q. And you have saved considerable money since you have been in this country as far as labor goes?</p>

<p>A. Yes, because I want to send for my family.</p>

<p>That said questions and answeres were reported by a stenographer employed by the United States Department of Labor and were subsequently transcribed and introduced in evidence against the coomplainant in substantiation of the charges set forth in the warrant of arrest hereinbefore referred to together with many other questions and answers having no bearing upon or in any way material to said charge. That at no time was the complainant questioned as to whether he ever advocated or taught anarchy or the over-throw by force or violence of the government of the United States or the assassination of public officials or that he was a person likely to become a public charge at the time of his entry except as above indicated, nor was any evidence of any character offered or received upon any of said questions except as above indicated. That thereafter, the complainant was, upon order of the secretary of labor of the United States, released from custody upon depositing bail in the sum of $2,500.00, and that upon the first day of February, 1919, the complainant was arrested by the said Henry M.White as commissioner of labor of the United States, and placed in custody, and that he is still held in said custody by the said Henry M.White; that on the <gap></gap> day of <gap></gap> 1919, the secretary of labor of the United States issued an order directing the deportation of the complainant to Italy.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>That the complainant is now and ever since the 8th day of November, 1917, has been continuously restrained of his liberty in the detention station of the immigration service at Seattle, Washington, by Henry M.White, United States Commissioner of Immigration stationed at Seattle, Washington, except during the  time he was released on bail under the pretended authority of the warrant of arrest and order of deportation issued by the secretary of labor as hereinabove alleged, and not otherwise, and that said restraint and order of deportation is illegal for the following reason, to-wit: That on the hearing conducted to inquire into the charges upon which the complainant is restrained of his liberty and ordered deported above referred to, no evidence whatever was introduced to sustain the charges preferred against the complainant or in any way sustaining an order directing that the complainant be deported from the United States, or any other order in any way restraining the complainant of his liberty and that the said warrant and order which the said secretary of labor has made is arbitrary and wholly void, and that the complainant has been at the time hereinabove referred to and now is restrained of his liberty without due process of law and deprived of his rights under the provisions of the Fifth Article of the Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p>That complainant is informed and believes that there are only two copies of the testimony introduced on the hearing of the charges upon which he is restrained of his liberty and that one of said copies is in the possession of the secretary of labor or the United States at Washington, D.C., and the other is in the possession of Henry M. White, Commissioner of Labor of the United States at Seattle, Washington. That complainant demanded a copy of said evidence in order that he might attach the same to this petition but his demand therefor was refused by said Henry M. White. That complainant is a wage earner and as a result of his long confinement and the deprivation of his usual means of support he is unable, by reason of his poverty, to pay for the preparation of such a copy, but deponent is informed by his attorney, and believes that if the said Henry M.White is required to produce the transcript of said evidence, now in his possession, and make the same a part of his return herein, or exhibit the same to the court, the verity of complainant's allegations in relatiion thereto will clearly appear therefrom.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE, complainant prays for an order directed to Henry M.White, commissionerof labor of the United States, stationed at Seattle, Washington, requiring him to produce the body of the complainant in the above entitled court before the Honorable Jeremiah Neterer, the Judge thereof, on the 10th day of February 1919, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and that he then and there show cause, if any he has, why the complainant should be further restrained of his liberty and further directing that the said Henry M.White also then and there produce, properly authenticated under his seal, the copy of the testimony taken at the hearing held pursuant to the mandate of the warrant of arrest issued by the secretary of labor of the United States pursuant to which the complainant, alias Bartolomeo Massulo, is restrained of his liberty by the said Henry M.White, and is deported by the said secretary of labor.</p>

<p>SS</p>

<p>BARTOLOMEO MASSULO being first duly sworn on oath deposes and says: That he is the complainent above named, that he believes the same to be true.</p>

<p>Bartolomeo Massullo</p>

<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 3rd day of February, 1919.</p>
