<p>Territory of Washington} In the District Court 4th JuCounty 
of Spokane}ss dicial District holding
terms at County seat of
Spokane County</p>

<p>Territory of Washington
vs. Plaintiff
Ray Raymond Defendant</p>

<p>Territory of Washington}
County of Spokane}ss </p>

<p>Thomas C. Griffitts, J. Kennedy
Stout, N.T. Caton, and Frederick Stanford
being each individually duly sworn
depose and swear as follows:
That they and each of them are of counsel a
attorney for defendant Ray Raymond in
this cause that said defendant cannot
safely present to trial therein at this time
of this court for the following reasons:
The indictment against her eas returned
herein December 1, 1886, and the defendants
plea infered of not guilty on Dec. 1, 1886.
That immediately thereafter defendant
counsel made a motion for change of
venue herein and present the same to the
hearing at the earliest time the convenience
of the court and counsel for the Territory
permitted, and said motion was finally 
determined and awarded De.
14, 1886, defendant by her counsel immediately 

<pb/>

give in there this written for a continuance.
That this did question for a change of venue was
made by defendant and her counsel in the utmost 
good faith and they are greatly taken 
by surprise both by the affidavit filed herein
by the territory and on the said motion and at
the pending of the same and believing
their said motion were taken, they did not
show a motion for a continuance herein
would be necessary until the final determination 
of said motion for a change of
venue. That would the findind and presentment
of the indictment hererin neither affiant nor
defendant knew with what crime defendant
would be accused nor what the issue herein
would be whether she would be accused
of any offense whatsoever or of an offense
insodoing the issue of malice in the killing
of Finch. That at time such indictment
was presented this term of this court had
duly been in sworn and counsel for defendant
had been constant in attendance.
Then now and ever since said indictment
was returned into the court and
defendant counsel herein have been
in about constant attendance
at this court and expressed either in 
the trial of counsel therein or in watching

<pb/>

and waiting for the trial of pending course
or preparing for the trial of cause such
pending in this court and for trial
and of pursing importance and still
to be tried herein that considerable time
since the finding of said indictment have
been recopied by defendant counsel in
the preparation for and hearing of said
motion for a change of venue and since
its determination in the preparation
of a showing for the continuance; that
in addition to their other habeas as afore
detailed counsel immediately set
about making such preparation
as they could under the circumstances
for the trial of the cause attending to well
aware they could not fully prepare
thereupon and in fact counsel believes
that the later date in the term when
this indictment was presented, the
bona fide efforts they had made and the
parts directed in the showing for
change of venue made by them and which is here
referred to as part of the new herein and the continuation
of that cas at this <del>cause</del>term of court and the
return of the indictment herein and the great
expense and delay of procuring a jury
herein at this time, with the facts he afore

<pb/>

States in this affidavit would appear to the 
direction of this court and precinct there 
from being compelled to go to trial 
at this time, that from to the finding 
of the indictment herin defendant and 
affiants has said inquiry concerning 
an George Wycoff who affiants were 
informed lived about 22 miles from 
Spokane Sea<del></del> and when affiant had 
been informed was in defendants' 
parlor in the night of the killing of 
Finch, and had been reliably informed 
that said Wycoff was temporarily absent 
from his home and from Spokane 
County and about walla walla county 
somewhere but just where affiants 
could not leave, that shortly after the 
finding of the indictment-herein 
affiant directs a subpoena to issue herein 
for him, 
that they were subsequently informed 
he comes with be found and they have only 
<unclear></unclear> within this days that he has 
been found and is somewhere in Spokane 
Falls on a witness for the prosecution 
that said Wycoff is wholly unknown
 to affiant <add>defendent</add> and her counsel by sight even 
they are unable to say whether in

<pb/>

not he was <del>for</del> in defendant's parlor as 
aforesaid at time of the killing is what he 
<del><unclear>has of his there</unclear></del> can will swear to 
on said trial, but affiants have heard that he claims to have been an eye=witness to the shooting. That since the finding of this indictment- affiant have also learned that the prosecution have still another witness by the name of Donalson but whose given name is unknown to affaints, and who has not a witness upon the preliminary examination herein for before the 9 rounds jury and whose name is not in the indictment who also claims and intends to swear that he was present <add> at the time</add> <del>that height</del> of the Killing of Finch and <unclear>who</unclear> is defendant's parlor at the time and that he was an eye=witness to the shooting. That whether or not <unclear></unclear> Donalson was present in defendents parlor at the time of the shooting of Finch affiants do not know <add> of this an knowledge the name heard of that effect</add> except from his statements, but affiants allege that-they are informed <del>for  <unclear></unclear></del> that if he was present in said parlor he occupied a position therein which rendered is impossible for him to see the occurances leading to and act of shooting of Finch, and that the same fact is true of the said George Wycoff and that he

<pb/>

if present at all in defendant's parlor at time of said 
killing also occupied a position where 
he comes with see any verify the of fray 
out of which the killing arose or the act 
of killing. That within affiant's <unclear>is no</unclear>
the defendant. Knew until since the 
finding of this indicment- that- the 
prosecution had welaimers to house 
such witness and affiants and claimed 
that the prosecution had reclaimed the 
witness Wycoff within the last two 
days. That within affiants <unclear>or no</unclear> defendant
know fully what the prosecution intends 
to prove by said witness in the trial 
of this cause and they are not oufficially 
acquainted with said witnesses at this time
to be able fully to meet them and guard
agaisnt surprise on the trial of the
current this time <del></del> affiants have refer
to the affidavit of defendant herein filed
in support hereof, affiants further allege
that they have used all possibile diligence
to prepare to meet such witnesses since
they became aware that the Territory
had procured there and would offer
their Testimony and have been unable
to do so, 

Affiants further allege as another <unclear>ground</unclear>this motion;
<pb/>

That one of the grounds of defense which they expect
to maintain in fact of defendant in their cause
is that <del>on the time</del> of insanity at the time
of the killing, that defendant is and for many years
mental disorder, <del>which</del> and that the same is
hereditary in her family, and that-at the time
of the killing, going Finch defendant was
insane and in such mental condition as
to be incapable of committing the crime
with which she is charged in this indictment
That on the trial of this cause affiants expect
to prove by me W. J. Woods of Ogden in
The Territory of Utah, That- he has known
defendant for about 15 years; That- he was
married to defendant 14 years ago and
lived with her 5 or 6 years and by her
had two children; That- at the time she
was his wife and he living with her as such
she was afflicted with the disease of
<add><unclear>Eurotimal and nervous hereditary</unclear></add> insanity the same as that with which
she was afflicted at the time of the killing
alleged in the indictment-herein
but the details of what said witness <del></del> since <unclear></unclear>T. bearing upon this issues
affiants cannot fully state, but affiants 
expect to prove by him the facts above stated
and the fact that insanity is a hereditary Trait
in defendants family. That we better received

<pb/>

by one of defendants causes in the month of July, 1886
with the envelope in which the same was received
is presented herewith marked
A. B. and made part of this affidavit
That since the finding of this indictment 
it has been impossible to procure the attendance
of said witness <add>words</add> at this term of this court
is to procure a deposition from him even
if his deposition <del></del>would be
proper and admissible but that from
information from and friendly disposition
of said witness towards defendant, and
from the fact that tdefendant has sufficient
money to pay the expense of said
witness from Ogden aforesaid to Spokane
Falls of the plane upholding their court
and the expense of his attendance
herein, and that she will <unclear></unclear> the 
same to procure his attendance
all of which is have states as facts, affiants
believes and have reasonable grounds
to believe, there they can procure the personal
attendance of said witness at the 
next term of this court for the trial of this
cause-

Affiants further expect to prove and can
prove by said witness word that somewhere
in her sound mind and lucid

<pb/>

intervals defendants is a peaceable, kind=hearted 
woman, exceedingly timid
and cowardly and afraid of assaults on
force of any kind and with in any manner
given to quarreling or the use of <unclear></unclear>,
This testimony is mentioned in view of the 
fact that- defendant is charged with
maliciously and purposely killing James
Finch and that is in a fact that said
Finch was at the time of the killing of
Finch with which she is charged a total stranger
to her.

    That affiants expect to prove substantially that
same facts as above stating concerning defendants
insanity <add>and peaceable disposition</add> by the <del><unclear>process</unclear></del> are
William Mc Dermontt, who is now a 
resident-of Butte City, Montana, that
one of affiants has seen and talked with said
Mc Dermontt within the last two months
and is informed by him that he will swear
That defendant is and for many years
has been insane and afflicted with such
mental disorder and that it is hereditery 
in her family; that the said McDermontt
is a brother = in = paw of defendant
and has known her long and intimately
and is intimately acquianted with
her family, that when not under the
influence of such disease defendant is

<pb/>

a woman of peaceable character and
kind disposition; that he will attend the
trial at this court at such trial is the
same shall take place if he be notified
of the time and the place of the trial: Tat- issue
the finding of that indictment- affiants
have been unable to communicate with
said Mc Dermontt for the reason That
as they are informed and believe he is
traveling somewhere in the mining
regions of Idaho and only temporarily away
from house, That one of affiants N. T.
Caton, saw and conversed with said
McDermontt near Murray A. Y. about
six weeks ago affiants believes from
there facts that his attendance can be
procured at the next term up this 
court to testify in the trial of this
<del>court</del> cause

    That affiants epect to prove by both of said 
above named witnesses that <add>are if <del>Deft</del></add> defendants 
Aunt. <del>was</del> was afflicted with the same species
of insanity and became therefore
hopelessly insane and that then
members of her family have also seen
afflicted with insanity.

    Affiants expect to prove substantially the
same facts as above alleged by the

<pb/>

members of <del>off</del> defendants family. To-wit- two
brothers and one sister, all of whom are
<del>not</del> non-residents of and now absent
from the Territory of Washington but
where personal attendance within 
court at the trial of this cause affiants
hope to obtain of given time to do so. That
it has been impossible since the finding of
this indictment for counsel to propose
for the trial of this issue on this term of this
court for the reasons stated herein.
<del>and for the just <unclear>reason that</unclear></del>

    That one of defendants family said in
the Territory of Washington and affiants'
know of no other witnesses by where
They can prove the facts to which 
either the witness Woods by McDermontt
will Testify as above stated, except asks members
of defendants family as above stated
and affiants counsel state in detail
what they can prove by such members
of her family for the reason they have
not sufficiently communicated with
them of and concerning this issue, but
of their case is continues until the
next term of this court affiants allege
it is their purpose to acertain to what
such persons can testify and to
know their testimony and they
<pb/>

believe they since be able to do so.

    And affiants say that this <unclear>account</unclear>
is not made for delay, but that
justice may be done.
