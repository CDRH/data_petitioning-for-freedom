    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Meyer Green, the petitioner, was prosecuted for trying to avoid business regulations by Police Judge Gordon and petitioned for a writ of Habeas Corpus on grounds that the state statute was unconstitutional. Green's petition was evaluated and rejected by Judge Baker. Green's petition was then evaluated by the Supreme Court, which found an error with the district court decision siding with him and reversed the opinion under Chief Justice Sullivan. 

During the litigation process, likely before the decision by Judge Baker, the case was seen by Judge Estelle, who approved the writ and found Green to be unlawfully detained. It is unclear precisely when this occurred in reference to litigation. </li>
