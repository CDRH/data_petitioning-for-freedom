<p>STATE OF WASHINGTON 
COUNTY OF KING ))) SS:</p>
<p>Bhagat Singh, Nadhan Singh, Nan Singh and Ballah Singh, 
being first duly sworn, depose and say;</p>
<p>That we came over on the Steamship Minnesota
with the seventy-three Hindoo aliens whose cases are 
before the Honorable Jeremiah Neterer, in the Federal 
Court, Seattle, Washington, and we know it to be a fact
as we have seen the certificates held by the various
aliens and we know that each one of them had from one 
to five or six of these certificates. That the attached
paper, signed by an immigration inspector and 
marked with the letter "A" is a similar sort of certificate
to the one received by all of these aliens when 
they landed in Manila and after they had been examined
and passed, and this certificate was taken up by the 
government at the time of the issuance of certificates
similar to this attached, marked "B".</p>
<p>That the affiant, Bhagat Singh, having interpreted
for the immigration officers at Manila for a period
of approximately one year prior to affiant's leaving
the Philippine Islands, and he knows by reason of his 
having interpreted for the government that the special 
certificates of registration which were held by all of
the aliens involved in this hearing would not have been 
issued and been given to the aliens unless they had first
had certificate "A" which was given them only after a 
proper admission at Manila and a proper examination,
<pb></pb>
and after having been passed by the immigration authorities.
The other affiants besides Bhagat Singh, testifying 
herein, know that certificate "A" was only 
issued after being passed by the immigration board at 
Manila and a proper examination, and that certificate
"A" was absolutely necessary in order to permit aliens
to have gotten certificate "B". These affiants all 
know that this was the method used by the government 
in Manila and that the holding of certificates similar
to "B" signified an examination by the government 
immigration officals at Manila and a prior holding of 
a certificate similar to certificate "A". Bhagat
Singh further to positive that this affidavit is true
as to the method employed by the government at Manila
in that he had lost his certificate "A" and endeavored
to get a certificate "B" such as was held by all of 
these seventy-three aliens, and the government informed
him that he must have certificate "A" before he could 
get a certificate "B" and he was compelled to return to the 
government officers and get from the immigration authorities 
certificate "A" that is a duplicate of the one which 
had been given him after his examination before he could 
secure certificates "B".
