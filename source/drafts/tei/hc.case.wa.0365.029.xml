<p>INCLOSURE 3797</p>

<p>FROM
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,
BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVE OF GALACIA
(WEST UKRAINIAN REPUBLIC)
WASHINGTON, D.C.</p>

<p>File #125</p>

<p>September 13, 1921.</p>

<p>Mr. Leo B. Rusell,
Bureau of Immigration,
Department of Labor,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>In accoradance with our telephone conversation, I have the honor
to send you the following information:</p>

<p>Galacia or West Ukraine (generally called East Galicia) is a
part of the former Austrian Monarchy. After the collapse of
the Austrian Monrachy in 1918, the people of Galicia (East
Galicia) organized themselves as an independent republic with
their own perliament, government and army.</p>

<p>This West Ukrainian or Galician Republic is to be distinguished
from the Republic of Ukraine, which was organized in the south
of the former Russian Empire after the outbreak of the Russian
Revolution in 1917. This Republic of Ukraine has its diplomatic
mission of Washington since 1919. On the other hand, the
Republic of Galicia (West Ukraine) sent its mission to the United
States in 1921.</p>

<p>The government of the Galician Republic is now temporarily in exile
outside the boundaries of this country because Galicia in 1919,
after a bloody war which lasted for nine months between Galicia
and Poland, was militarily occupied by Poland; but the Galician
Government, the Great Allied Powers, and the League of Nations
did not recognize the pretentions of Poland to this country. All
these factors regard Galicia as a seperate entity of international
law.</p>

<p>I take the liberty to mention that your Bureau of Immigration
also was of this correct opinion when it pointed out East Galicia
as a separate state in the list showing the annual number of
immigrants permitted to enter the United States from every
European country.</p>

<p>For further information of the Galician Republic, I beg to
refer you to the enclosed statement, especially on pages 7 to 10
inclusive, where the international status of this country is
discussed.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>In reference to the passports, I wish to emphasize that the
passports of our Republic in Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Berlin, Paris,
London and Washington. All these representations, with the
exception of the representation at Washington, are functioning
since 1919 wihtout any interruptions.</p>

<p>Our mission in Washington was opened not only for diplomatic
purposes but also for the needs of the natives of East Galicia
of whom about 1,000,000 live in the United States and about
300,000 in Canada and who regard themselves as citizens of
the Galician Republic.</p>

<p>If there is any other information you desire, please turn to
us and we shall gladly furnish you with the same; we shall also
be glad to serve you in all passport cases of natives of
Galicia.</p>

<p>Very truly yours,
<unclear></unclear>
Diplomatic Representative of Galicia.</p>
