    <li>Summary of Proceedings: Samuel Coulter was a federal tax collector in Washington Territory. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the second judicial district after refusing to supply copies of tax records to a judge in the third judicial district, for which said judge held him in contempt and ordered his arrest. After hearing the evidence, a judge in the second judicial district ordered him to be discharged. It is unclear from the case file whether he had been arrested, or if he filed for habeas relief preemptively.</li>
