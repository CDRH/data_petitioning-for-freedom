<p>KANSAS REPORTS.</p>

<p>States to make such regulations for his government as the president of the United States should deem proper, and for the interest of the tribe to which he belonged; or, in other words, Keokuk was then a ward of the government, and if the government should think it for the interest of Keokuk, or his tribe, to restrain him from going to Washington, it had a clear right so to do." We are not prepared to give our sanction to the doctrine above set forth; but might well do so, and not disturb the action of the court below, for we are nowhere shown any law of the United States, or any regulation of the president, that makes it a punishable offense for an Indian to go to Washington or superintendent. But we suppose that nothing but  a law would avail as a justification for arresting and imprisoning a man. If it is necessary to elucidate this point, then indeed have we learned little of the principles of a government professedly based on law. Nor does it make any difference that the party injured is an Indian, whether he be regarded as "a ward of government," or as belonging to a "domestic dependent nation," or " a distinct, independent political community, retaining their original natural rights,"--to each of which classes they have at times been assigned by the language of the supreme court of the United States. In any view, while keeping the peace, and disobeying no law, human or divine, he cannot be the subject of arrest or imprisonment by any one, except at the peril of the offender. His rights are regulated by law, and when he appeals to the law for redress, it is not in the power of any tribunal to say, "You are an Indian, and your rights rest in the arbitrary decrees of executive officers, and not in the law."</p>
<p>[*111] *We shall not disturb the decision of the court below for the reasons assigned; and having examined the record, and all the alleged errors, and finding no reason to reverse the judgment of the court below, the same will be affirmed.</p>
<p>SAFFORD, J., concurring.</p>

<p>VALENTINE, J. I agree with the court upon all questions of law and of fact in this case, except that I do not htink that the answer of the defendant Wiley, in the court below, bears the construction put upon it by this court.</p>
