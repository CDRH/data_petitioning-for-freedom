office for himself as dentist on High Street, Plumstead, London, S.E.
where he continued the practice of dentistry for two years.</p>
<p>In April 1903 an account of ill health petitioner removed
to Canada and made his home at Lethbridge, Alberta for five years
where he continued to practice his profession as dentist.</p>
<p>That in Febrauary 1908 petitioner  moved to Seattle, Washington
and declaring his intention to become a citizen of the United States 
he opened an office as dentist at East 72d Street, Greenlake, Seattle
where he has continued the practice od dentistry undisturbed until
the issue of the warrant of arrest herein complained of.</p>
<p>That immediately upon opening his said office and before beginning
the practice of dentistry at Seattle, aforesaid, your petitioner
duly applied to the State Board of Dentistry of the state of Washington
for license to practice dentistry, tendered the legal fee and 
offered himself for examination, pursuant to law, and in all things
complied with the requirements of the statutes in such case made and
provided, save only, that he did not present any diploma from any 
college of dentistry whatever for the reason that he did not possess
one and does not now possess any, having obtained his possession,
learning and skill at the places, by the practice and study and in 
<pb/>
the matter hereinbefore set forth.</p>
<p>That for the reason that he did not and could not present
any such diploma the said State Board of Dentistry Examiners refused
to receive the application of petitioner of a license, refused to
examine him as to his qualifications to practice dentistry and refused
to grant him any license therefor. </p>
<p>Petitioner further shows that he is and at all times has 
been ready and willing to submit to examination by any duly constituted 
authority as to his qualifications to practice dentistry and is
willing to pay the fees provided by law and otherwise comply with
all the provisions of law and with all reasonable requirements, save
the presetnation of a diploma aforesaid. </p>
<p>That in order to obtain such diploma it would be 
necessary that petitioner attend some dental college for at least three years;
that no such college exists in the state of Washington, or ever has
existed in this state, and that your petitioner is unable for want
of financial means to sustain himself and his family during the time
that would be required to go to some other state and attend such
college and obtain such diploma, and that were he to take that course
he would learn nothing more than he alread knows, would acquire no
other or further skill than he already possess and would be no
better qualified in point of fact to practice his profession than he
now is.</p>
<p>Petitioner further says that he is fully qualified by experience,
study and practice to perform all the operations incident to
his profession with skill and according to the best standards to
practice in that profession. That he always has and still does read
and study arduously in all the matters and things pertaining to his
profession and keeps himself fully up to the best and most modern
standards in the practice of dentistry and dental surgery. That he
<pb/>
maintains and has ever maintained in Seattle during his practice 
there, one of the best equipped dental offices in the city and has
a large clientele of patients and customers, not one of whom has
ever complained of any inattention, want of skill or otherwise in 
the course of his practice here.</p>
<p>That your petitioner possesses and will present to your
Honor the highest recommendations as to moral character and professional 
skill from those with whom he has been employed. That your
petitioner is a man of family and of good character and in every way
qualified to practice the profession of dentistry aforesaid.</p>
<p>Your petitioner further shows that H. F. Conover the complainant
who caused his arrest, was employed by the State Dental Board to
obtain information and to solicit and induce your petitioner to perform
upon him an operation in dental surgery, to- wit: the removing
of two decayed teeth, for the express purpose of causing petitioner's
arrest therefor, and not for any honest purpose in promoting the
public health, morals or safety.</p>
<p>Petitioner further shows that there are many dentists now
practicing as such in the state of Washingon who were so practicing
and were residents of the state in the year <unclear>1901</unclear>, at the time of
the passage of the law above quoted, who never have been examined
by the state board nor possessed any diploma from any dental college.</p>
<p>Petitioner further shows that the Supreme Court of the state
of Washington has declared the said law herein quoted to be not
violative of the state or federal constitution in the particulars
herein set forth, and that unless this honorable court defends and 
preserves the rights of your petitioner under the constitution of
the United States and of the state of Washington, petitioner will
be further restrained of his liberty and deprived of his property
pursuant to said void unconstitutional law and in violation
of the constitution of the United States in the particulars as
<pb/>
aforesaid.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE your petitioner prays that a Writ of Habeas Corpus
