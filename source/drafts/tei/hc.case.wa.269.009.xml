<p>  In The United States Ciruit Court, For the 
    Ninth Juidicial Circuit, Western Division of the State of Washington, Northern Division.</p>
    
<p> In re. Parte: 
    Turner Jackson, 
    Petitioner. No. 1325. </p>
    
<p>Assignment of Errors  </p>
    
<p> Comes now the United States and the United States Marshal, appellants in the
    above entitled proceeding, by said attorney, Jesse A
    Frye, United States Attorney for the Western District
    of Washington, and in connection with said appeal herein, 
    say: That in record and proceedings in the
    above entitled matter, and in the order and judgement 
    rendered and entered herein on the 11th day of September
    1905, there is manifest error, in this to wit: </p>
    
<p> I. 
    That Court erred in finding that the petitioner,
    Turner Jackson, was wrongfully restrained of his liberty, </p>
    
<p> II.
    The Court erred in finding that the petitioner, 
    Turner Jackson, was unlawfully held in custody by the
    United States Marshal for the Western District of Washington. </p>
    
<p> III.
    The Cout erred in holding and finding that the
    petitioner, Turner Jackson, was unlawfully held in
    custody by the Warden of the United States Penitentiary 
    on McNeil's Island, Washington.  </p>
    
<p> IV.
    The Cout erred in holding and finding that 
    the terms of imprisonment of the petitioner, Turner Jackson, 
    had expried as provided by law. </p>
 
    <pb/>
    
<p> V. 
    The Court erred in ordering and adjusting that the
    petitioner, Turner Jackson, was entitled to be dis-
    charged from the cusotdy of the United States Marshal. </p>
    
<p> VI. 
    The Court erred in ordering and directing the 
    United States Marshal for the Western District of 
    Washington to discharge said Turner Jackson from
    custody and imprisonment/</p>
    
<p> VII. 
    The Court erred in ordering and directing that the 
    petitoner, Turner Jackson, be discharged from the
    United States penitentiary on McNeil's Island. </p>
    
<p> VIII.
    The Court erred in ordering the petitioner, Turner
    Jackson to be released from the custody of the officers
    of the United States.  </p>
    
<p> IX. 
    The Court erred in releasing and discharging the
    petitioner from the custody of the officers of the
    United States and restoring him to liberty.</p>
    
<p> X. 
    The Court erred in entering the order and judgement 
    of date of September 11, 1905 in the premises, dis-
    charging the petitioner, Turner Jackson, from the custody 
    of the United States officers and restoring him to his 
    liberty, for the reason that said order and judgement
    is not supported by the law in the premises, adn that 
    said order and judgement of discharge is contrary to the
    facts in the premises, and that said order and judgement 
    of discharge is not warranted, nor supported by the
    facts, nor the law in the premises, and that said judg-
    ement and order of discharge is contrary to law.  </p>
    <pb/>
    
<p> Wherefore, the United Stated Marshal for the
    Western District of Washington, and the United States
    of America, Appellants, pray: that their assignment
    of errors be entered upon the record in this proceeding;
    and they further pray that upon the hearing of 
    this appeal it may be adjudged by the United Sates
    Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, that the 
    order and judgement in this proceeding entered on
    the 11th day of September 1905, be in all things reversed 
    and set aside, and in all things held for naught, and
    that the petitioner, Turner Jackson, be remanded to the 
    custody of the United States Marshal for the Western 
    District of Washington, and that he may be imprisoned
    in the United States Penitentiary on McNeil's Island, 
    State of Washington, and there held until his term of
    sentence expires according to law.  </p>
    
<p>  Jesse A Frye, 
    United States Attorney 
    and Attorney for Appelants. </p>
