      <p class="tei_p">REDIRECT EXAMINATION:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Q. [Ronald] From what you know of her, then she is as competent to raise her children and educate and school them as other poor women? A. That is wha.t I mean, that is, that the same rule that would deprive her of the child would rob a great many women that are considered competent to rear their children.</p>
