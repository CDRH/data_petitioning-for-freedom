<p>I N T H E U N I T E D S T A T E S C I R C U I T C O U R T,</p>
<p>FOR THE DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, NORTHERN DIVISION.</p>
<p>--------oo00oo-------</p>
<p>In the matter of the application:
of Pat Burns for the Writ of Habeas Corpus: P E T I T I O N
and Relief thereon.</p>
<p>To the Honorable Circuit Court of the United States, for the District
of Washington, and to the Judges thereof: </p>
<p>Your petitioner, Pat Burns, alleges and shows:</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>That he is a citizen and a resident of the United States, residing
in the County of King, at the City of Seattle, in the State of Washington.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>That he is now being unlawfully detained and unlawfully held
 in custody by William H. Moyer, Sheriff of King County, and, against his
wish, is being held by the said Moyer under threats of the said Moyer,
as Sheriff of King County, to transport him, the Petitioner, to the
State Penitentary at Walla Walla, there to be confined for the period
of five years under an alleged process and authority as herein-
after more fully stated; and that the said Moyer threatens to carry
said incarceration into immediate execution.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner alleges that the said threat and attempt to
imprision him as aforesaid is set for and arranged to be, as your 
Petitioner understands, at once, and that the same is wholly without
authority of law and without the jurisdiction of any court and contrary
to the Laws and contrary to the rights of your Petitioner as a citizen
of the United States under the constitution and law as will more fully
appear in the matters hereinafter set forth.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner informs the court that on or about the 13 day of 
June, 1897 he was attempted to be charged by the State of 
Washington, by pretended information of the crime of grand larceny.
and that your Petitioner was tried upon said alleged information upon
issue joined in the Superior Court of King County, State of Washington,
and was in said Court by virtue of said alleged information found
guilty and sentenced by said court to 5 years in the Penitentiary
of the State of washington, and that Your Petitioner perfected an
appeal from said judgment which has been by the Supreme Court of
the State of Washington affirmed upon the errors therein  assigned,
and that said charge of grand larceny of which your Petitioner was
convicted was and is a felony, and that Your Petitioner was not
proceeded against by an indictment by any grand Jury of said Court;
but, on the contrary, upon information, which information was an 
attempt to comply with the Constitution and Laws of the State of 
Washington, but that the same was not verified as by law required;
and your Pettioner further states, that the provision of the said
Constitution of the State of Washington and the laws enacted there-
under whereby and upon which said attemped information was predicated
were, and are, in derogation of and against the constitutional liber-
ties granted your petitioner by the Constiution of the United States,
and that the Honorable Court so trying and sentencing your Petitioner
was wholly without jurisdiction and all of its acts in the premises
were absolutely void: and that said court nort the judge thereof had
any jurisdiction or authority to make any order of imprisonment for
the imprisonment of your Petitioner in said cause; tthat notwithstand-
ing all of the objections presented before said court and said Judge,
your Petitioner was nevertheless ordered to be incarcerated as afore-
said; that there was no authority for such order and the same is 
wholly contrary to the laws of the United States and of the Con-
stitution of the United States and the rights of your Petitioner as a 
citizen of the United States,</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, your Petitioner asks that upon due hearing of the cause
and upon examination of the records of the cause and the evidence in 
the cause, your Honor will make an order discharging your Petitioner
and that your Honor will grant unto your Petitioner a Writ of Habeas
Corpus commanding your Petitioner to be brought before the Court at
such time and place as to the Court may be convenient for the hearing
of the matters and things herein alleged by your Petitioner, and that
your Honor do issue a Writ of certiotati to the Superior Court of the
State of Washington for King County ordering to be duly certified to
the Court the records of this said cause, particularily the alleged
information, the verdict, the judgment and warrant of imprisonment
made in the premises; that your Honor and the Court may be informed
in the premises, and that upon such records and upon hearing of the
cause such other and further orders shall be made in the premises
as will be right and proper,
And your Peitioner will ever pray.</p>
