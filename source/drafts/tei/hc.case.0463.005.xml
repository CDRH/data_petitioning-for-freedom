<ab>In the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of
Washington. Northern Division.</ab>

<ab>In the matter of the application of
John McKinnon
for 
a writ of Habeas Corpus.</ab>

<ab>U.S. Marshal's
Return</ab>

<p>Now comes James C. Drake, the United States Marshal for the 
District of Washington, and for his answer and return to the rule
heretofore made in this cause requiringg him to show cause before
this court why a writ of habeas corpus should not issue herein as
prayed:</p>

<ab>Showeth:</ab>

<p>That said John McKinnon was arrested upon a warrant issued by
A. H. Kenyon, Esq., a commissioner of the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Washington, upon a complaint
made upon the oath of E.C. Simmons, a special agent of the Gobernment
of the Province of British Columbia, said province being
one of the provinces of Great Britain, between which said last
named government and the United States there exists a treaty and
convention providing for the extradition of persons charged with
larceny and other crimes, charging the said John McKinnon with
the crime of larceny committed in said province on or about the
18th day of August, 1895, by then and there unlawfully, wilfully
and feloniously stealing, taking and carrying away four neat cattle
of the value of fifty dollars, of the goods and chattels of
one Cornelius O'Keefe, contrary to the laws of said province.</p>

<p>That said Kenyon as said commissioner had full power and authority
to issue said warrant and hear said complaint and the
evidence offered, and commit said John McKinnon to the custody
of the Marshal of said district until he could, by proper proceedings, 
be extradited to said province, or otherwise dealt with

<pb/>

according to law.</p>

<p>That thereafter, on the 23rd day of December, 1896, the said
John McKinnon was brought before said commissioner to answer said
charge, and the evidence in support of said charge and on behalf
of said John McKinnon was introduced before said commissioner,
and the said commissioner after hearing said evidence and carefully
considering the same found that the said offense, as charged,
had been comitted, and that said John McKinnon was guilty of
committing said offense as charged. Thereupon said commissioner
ordered that said John McKinnon be committed to the custody of
the marshal of the United States for said district in the County
Jail of Spokane County, Washington, to await the warrant of extradition,
and <del>him</del> there safely kept, until he be discharged by
due course of law, and said commissioner then and there issued
under his hand and seal a proper warrant of commitment containing
said order, and delivered the said warrant together with the body
of said John McKinnon to the undersigned Marshal, and that the
undersigned as such marshal now has said John McKinnon in his
custody in said county jail of said Spokane County under and by
virtue of said warrant of commitment and not otherwise. (Said
warrant of commitment is herewith attached and made a part of
this return.)</p>

<p>Wherefore, the undersigned as said marshal prays the judgment
of this court whether he should make any other or further return
herein, and further prays that said application be dismissed, 
and that he have and recover his costs herein.</p>
