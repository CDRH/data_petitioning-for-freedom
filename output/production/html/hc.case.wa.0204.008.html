      <p class="tei_p">These cases were heard together. The petitioners are 
 sisters, and are held by the Commissioner of Immigration under an
 order of deportation issued by the Secretary of Labor under 
 provisions of Section 4289 1/4 B, U.S. Compiled Statutes 1918, which provide,  among other things that:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">"The following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: Persons *** who disbelieve in or are opposed to organized government *** or persons likely to become a public charge **";</p>

      <p class="tei_p">And Section 4289 1/4 J J, U.S. Compiled Statutes, supra, which provides, among other things:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">"At any time within five years after entry, any alien 
who at the time of entry was a member of one or more 
of the classes excluded by law ***; any alien who at 
any time after entry shall be found advocating or teaching 
the unlawful destruction of property or advocating or 
teaching anarchy or the overthrow by force or violence of 
the government of the United States or of all forms of law."</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The petitioners are 26 and 23 years of age, respectively, and came to the United States in October, 1916. They had not to exceed

 Twenty-five Dollars each when they arrived; they did "housework" at 
Lawrence, Massachusetts for a time, then went to Chicago and did 
similar work, and also worked in the I. W. W. bindery, and came to 
Seattle in October, 1918, and were, shortly thereafter, arrested.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The evidence in each case is very similar. Each petitioner 
charges that there is no evidence to support the warrant of 
deportation and that she was not accorded a fair hearing. An examination 
of the testimony is conclusive that each of the petitioners 
believes in the overthrow of all present forms of government and that 
any and all means necessary to gain that end are justified, even 
resorting to violence, and, that the general beliefs of the petitioners 
were the same at the time of entrance into the United States, 
although not so intensified, and that they advocated this doctrine 
and principle when opportunity afforded. Margaret Roy, in response 
to the question, "And you advocated this doctrine wherever you 
could?" said "Yes". The beliefs, practise and teachings of each 
petitioner are practically the same. There are several ways by which
a person may teach or advocate. It need not be from the public 
platform or through the public press. It may be done in any way by 
which intelligent thought may be conveyed, by personal expression or 
any avenue through which information may be disseminated, or by the 
adoption of the expressed sentiment of others, or suggestions with 
relation to the guidance of the conduct of others.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">For Janet Roy-Mackay, it is contended that after the 
order of deportation was made and while she was at liberty on bond 
awaiting deportation, she married a citizen of the United States and 
thereby became a citizen and that she may not be deported.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On the hearing it was stated that the husband of Janet 
Roy-Mackey was born in Scotland, that he came to the United States 
with his parents while a minor; he believed his father had become 
naturalized while he was a minor, and that acting under such belief

he had excercised the rights of a citizen and because of such fact, 
it is asserted that a presumption would obtain that he is a citizen.
In answer to his assertion, it is only necessary to say that 
citizenship is a privilege; it is the highest privilege that the government
can give. It places a man of foreign birth on an equality with the 
native born. It is a privilege which the Congress of the United 
States may grant or withhold. It may grant it to certain classes of 
people or nationalities and withhold it from others, and residence in 
the United States or the exercise of any rights without compliance 
with the requirements will never ripen into citizenship. Citizenship 
may not be acquired by presumption. Before a person can be granted 
that high privilege, certain requisites are necessary. He must establish
by competent testimony, among other things, that he is a 
lover of this, his adopted, country, and its Constitution and laws, 
and in sincerity dedicate his life to its service, and conscientiously 
agree to defend it against all enemies. There is no evidence before 
the court that Mr. Mackay's father was a citizen, and, if it be 
conceded that this issue is rightly before the court, it has not been 
sustained. The only matter for the Court's determination is whether 
the order of deportion of the Secretary of Labor is supported by any
evidence however slight. If there is any evidence, the findings of 
the Secretary of Labor are conclusive. I think there is evidence to 
support the findings and the Court may not interfere.</p>
