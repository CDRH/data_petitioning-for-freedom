It would seem that it was intended by the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Defendants[?]</span> that case should be allowed only in actions but looking at <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">sec[?]</span> 458-464-465 we may reach the conclusion that cases shall be allowed to the party in whose favor a judgement is rendered and that the prevailing party shall be allowed for all necessary disbursments including fees of officers, witness fees</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The disbursments shall be stated in detail verified by affidavit and filed.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Now it is clear that the Atty for is no part of these disbursments. for the statue declares that these disbursments are to be allowed in addition to the allowance as provided in <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">sec[?]</span> 464.</p>

      <p class="tei_p"> There may be and is some question as to what was intended by the provisions

      <p class="tei_p">If we <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> this to mean this to wit; where <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> are allowed to either party vs that <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">sec[?]</span> 458 is of no effect because that section declares that costs shall be allowed to the party in whose favor a judgement is rendered $5</p>

and that by section 477 it is in the discretion of this court to allow or not allow costs in all proceedings in <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> and in the exercise of this discretion. I am not of opinion that this is such a proceeding as will warrant me in requiring the Plaintiff to pay a counsel fee to the Defendant in addition to the other costs. </p>
